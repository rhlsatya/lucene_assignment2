OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT












Implementation of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to issue regulations to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies
Act (PFCRA) which Congress enacted on October 21, 1986. The PFCRA provides a statutory right for the Federal Government
to take administrative action against fraud. The PFCRA also outlines the procedures that must be followed in administrative
actions brought in accordance with the act. These regulations will implement these procedural requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Public Law 99-509 provides a means by which Federal agencies may institute administrative proceedings against
persons who have presented false claims or statements and provides further that Federal agencies who institute such
administrative proceedings may recover double damages as well as penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.




The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act requires agencies to issue regulations. This rule establishes the procedures
that OPM will follow under this Act. The moneys collected as a result of these procedures are deposited as miscellaneous
receipts in the Treasury of the United States.



E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation



OPM has determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations will not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because their effects are limited primarily to federal employees and other entities who do business with OPM.

 185.107

Complaint.


(a) On or after the date the Department of Justice approves the issuance of a complaint in accordance with 31 U.S.C.

(3) Instructions for filing an answer, including a specific statement of the defendant's right to request a hearing
and to be represented by a representative; and

regulations.

official a general answer denying liability and requesting a hearing, and a request for an extension of time within
which to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The reviewing official shall file
promptly with the ALJ the complaint, the general answer denying liability, and the request for an extension of time
as provided in  185.110. For good cause shown, the ALJ may grant the defendant up to 30 additional days within
which to file an answer meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. The ALJ shall decide expeditiously

shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days after it is issued.
(e) If, before such an initial decision becomes final, the defendant files a motion with the ALJ seeking to reopen on
the grounds that extraordinary circumstances prevented the defendant from filing an answer, the initial decision
shall be stayed pending the ALJ's decision on the motion.
(f) If, on such motion, the defendant can demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing the failure to file a
timely answer, the ALJ shall withdraw the initial decision in paragraph (c) of this section, if such a decision has
been issued, and shall grant the defendant an opportunity to answer the complaint.
(g) A decision of the ALJ denying a defendant's motion under paragraph (e) of this section is not subject to reconsideration
under  185.138.
(h) The defendant may appeal to the authority head the decision denying a motion to reopen by filing a notice of appeal
with the authority head within 15 days after the ALJ denies the motion. The timely filing of a notice of appeal shall
stay the initial decision until the authority head decides the issue.

proceeding to the authority head.

failure to file a timely answer based solely on the record before the ALJ.

answer, the authority head shall remand the case to the ALJ with instructions to grant the defendant an opportunity
to answer.

 185.133 

Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.




(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon
appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their
opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud,
the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages
and a significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed.

in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (i.e., the false,
fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:

(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;


(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;


(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;


(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential
damages and the costs of investigation;


(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;


(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government programs
and operations;


(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940512-1-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;
(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices
fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;
(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect
to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;
(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in
similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or
indirectly;
(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and
(17) The potential impact of the misconduct on the rights of others.

that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.

so as to_

(3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
(d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure
of the facts.
(e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceedings without regard

only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness 
directive (AD), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146-100A, -200A, and 
-300A series airplanes, that currently requires replacing the quick release coupling halves 
on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the 
number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. This action 
would revise the applicability of the existing AD. This proposal is prompted by the 
identification of additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage 
from the pump case drain line quick release coupling, which could fuel the flames in the 
event of an engine fire.

Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, 
Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-42-AD, 
1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. 


Discussion 


On November 29, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93-24-05, Amendment 39-8754 (58 
FR 67310), applicable to certain British Aerospace Model BAe 146-100A, -200A, and 
-300A series airplanes, to require replacement of the quick release coupling halves on each 
end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic engine driven pump (EDP) on the number 
2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. That action was 
prompted by a fire resistance test of the hydraulic EDP, associated hoses, and couplings 
installed on the number 2 and number 3 engines, which revealed that the pump case drain 
line quick release couplings leaked hydraulic fluid. The requirements of that AD are 
intended to prevent hydraulic fluid leakage from the pump case drain line quick release 
coupling, which could fuel the flames in the event of an engine fire. 
Since issuance of that AD, British Aerospace has issued Service Bulletin 
SB.29-31-01339A, Revision 1, dated July 8, 1993, which revises the effectivity listing of 
the original issue of the service bulletin by adding the serial numbers of affected Model 
BAe 146-100A and -200A series airplanes. In addition, one Model BAe 146-300A series 
airplane, serial number E3220, is removed from the service bulletin effectivity. The Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, 
classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness 
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated 
for operation in the United States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to 
this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the 
situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all 
available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type 
design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD 
would supersede AD 93-24-05 to continue to require replacement of the quick release 
coupling halves on each end of the pump case drain line on the hydraulic EDP on the 
number 2 and number 3 engines with improved fire resistant coupling halves. The proposed AD would revise the applicability
of the existing AD, and would reflect the 
latest revision of the service bulletin as the appropriate source of service information. 
The FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this 
proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish 
the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required 
parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these 
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$7,590, or $165 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' 
under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); 
and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the 
Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the

Discussion 




Boeing Commercial Airplanes has advised the FAA of an unsafe condition that may exist in certain Boeing Model 747-400
series airplanes. Boeing advises that, if the Landing Gear Module connectors become disconnected, all Flap Control
Unit (FCU) modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. There has been
one occurrence of a partial disconnection of these connectors during a flight test of one airplane, which resulted
in some of the flaps failing to extend. In another incident, there was a partial disconnection of these connectors
on one in-service airplane that occurred while the airplane was on the ground; this situation prevented the airplane
from being dispatched. 


Disconnection of the subject connectors could result in the loss of all three modes of flap operation. If this were
to occur, the pilot would be unable to change the position of the leading and trailing edge flaps. This condition, if
not corrected, could result in an all-flaps-up (flaps retracted) landing and consequent high landing speeds that
could cause the airplane to run off the runway before being able to stop. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-27A2346, dated April 28, 1994, that describes
procedures for revising the FCU input wiring by moving two of the three FCU inputs from the ``Alt-Arm'' switch to the
Alternate Flap relays. This will keep the FCU's in the Primary Hydraulic/Pneumatic operation mode if the Landing
Gear Module connectors become disconnected, and would allow the pilot to maintain primary and secondary control
of the flaps. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require revising the FCU input wiring. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

There are approximately 300 Model 747-400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $25,500, or $750 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

of permit issuance prohibition, and UCA 40-10-17(2)(t)(ii), revegetation standards on lands eligible
for remining, are repealed effective September 30, 2004.
The plan provisions of the Utah Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Utah proposes to revise are (1) UCA 40-10-25,
lands and water eligible for reclamation; (2) UCA 40-10-27, entry upon land adversely affected by past
coal mining practices, State acquisition of land and public sale, and water pollution control and treatment plants;
and (3) UCA 40-10-28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land.
Following are more specific descriptions of the revisions that Utah proposes to make to the above-listed sections
of its statute. These descriptions do not address several editorial revisions including changes in punctuation
and capitalization; recodification; replacement of the word ``regulations'' and the term ``rules and regulations''
with the synonymous word ``rules;'' the joining with the conjunction ``and'' of the last two provisions in a series
of three or more provisions joined by semicolons; the use of Arabic numbers instead of spelling out the numbers; and
the deletion of the word ``this'' prior to the word ``Subsection'' when it is followed by a specific statute citation.
Utah proposes the following revisions to its program provisions.
Utah proposes to add new definitions for the terms (1) ``adjudicative proceeding'' at UCA 40-10-3(1)
to mean ``a division or board action or proceeding that determines the legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities,
or other legal interests of one or more identifiable persons, including all actions to grant, deny, revoke, suspend,
modify, annul, withdraw, or amend an authority, right, permit, or license;'' (2) ``lands eligible for remining''
at UCA 40-10-3(8) to mean ``those lands that would otherwise be eligible for expenditures under Section
40-10-25 or 40-10-25.1;'' and (3) ``unanticipated event or condition'' at UCA 40-10-3(21)
to mean ``an event or condition encountered in a remining operation that was not contemplated by the applicable surface
coal mining and reclamation permit.''

Utah proposes to revise its rulemaking authority and procedure provisions at UCA 40-10-6.5 by adding
new language at UCA 40-10-6.5(1) to require the Board of Oil, Gas and Mining (Board) to promulgate rules
in accordance with Title 63, Chapter 46a of the Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act and deleting the provisions of
UCA 40-10-6.5(3), which set forth the requirements for conducting hearings under Chapter 10.

Utah also proposes to require that the Board or Division shall conduct formal adjudicative proceedings, which are
referred to as hearings or public hearings. The conduct of these conferences and hearings will be governed by rules
adopted by the Board which are in accordance with Title 63, Chapter 46b of the Utah Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA).
In addition, Utah proposes that such hearings, will be conducted in a manner which guarantees the parties' due process
rights, includes provisions to ensure this protection, and requires a verbatim record of each public hearing required
by Chapter 10 will be made and a transcript will be available on the motion of any party or by order of the Board.


Utah proposes an editorial revision at UCA 40-10-10, permit applications, by changing the word ``implementing''
to ``the'' before the word ``rules.''


Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-11 by requiring that the schedule listing any and all notices of violations
submitted as part of the permit application include violations of any State or Federal program or law approved under
SMCRA. Utah also proposes to add new UCA 40-10-11(5) to require that (1) the prohibition of UCA 40-10-11(3),
concerning issuance of a permit to persons with outstanding violations or with a history of willful violations, does
not apply after October 14, 1992, if the violation resulted from an unanticipated event or condition that occurred
on lands eligible for remaining, (2) the term ``violation'' as used here as the same meaning as the term ``violation''
under UCA 40-10-11(3) prohibiting permit issuance, and (3) UCA 40-10-11(5) is repealed effective
September 30, 2004.


Utah proposes to add new langauge to its provisions pertaining to informal conferences at UCA 40-10-13(2)(b)
to specify that, if written objections to a proposed initial or revised application for a surface coal mining and reclamation
operations permit are filed, the Division will hold an informal conference and conduct it in accordance with subsection
(b) irrespective of the requirements of section 63-46b-5 of UAPA and that such conference may be held in
the locality of the coal mining and reclamation operation if requested within a reasonable time after written objections
or a request for an informal conference are received by the Division.


Utah proposes to revise its provisions at UCA 40-10-14, pertaining to permit approval or disapproval,
appeals, and further review, by adding new language at subsection (6) to provide that an applicant or aggrieved person
may appeal the Board's decision granting or denying the permit in whole or in part directly to the Utah Supreme Court,
that if the Board fails to act, the applicant or aggrieved person may bring an action in the appropriate district court,
and that time frames for appeals under this subsection shall be consistent with UAPA.


Utah proposes to revise its statutory provisions at UCA 40-10-16(6) for release of performance bonds,
sureties, or deposits by deleting the requirements that provide for advertisement of a public hearing, govern the
manner in which hearings are conducted, and allow the Division to establish an informal conference to resolve written

If written objections are filed and a conference is requested, the division shall inform all interested parties of
the time and place of the conference and hold an informal conference within 30 days after the request is filed with the
division. The conference officer may convert the conference to a formal proceeding under the standards set forth
in section 63-46b-4 [of the UAPA]. The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before the board and a hearing
shall be held in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure of the board. A decision from the informal conference
may be appealed to the board. The board shall hold a hearing pursuant to the rules of practice and procedure of the board.






Utah proposes to revise its performance standards provisions at UCA 40-10-17(2) by adding new subsection
(t)(ii) to require that on lands eligible for remining, the operations shall assume the responsibility for successful
revegetation for a period of 2 full years after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other

to specify that UCA 40-10-17(2)(t)(ii) is repealed effective September 30, 2004.

Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-18, operator requirements for underground coal mining, by adding new
subsection (4) to require the permittee of an underground coal mining operation after October 24, 1992, to promptly
repair or compensate for material damage resulting from subsidence to occupied residential dwellings and related
structures or noncommercial buildings. Utah further proposes that repair of damage includes rehabilitation, restoration,
or replacement of such damaged dwellings, structures, or buildings; and compensation is to be in the full amount of
the diminution in value resulting from the subsidence. Lastly, Utah proposes that the requirement to repair or compensate
for material damage resulting from subsidence will not prohibit or interrupt underground coal mining operations,
and the Board will adopt final rules to implement these provisions within 1 year after enactment of UCA 40-10-18(4).


Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-20, contest of violation or amount of penalty, by adding new subsection
(2)(e)(ii) to provide that if the operator fails to submit the amount of the civil penalty within 30 days of receipt
of the results of an informal conference, the operator waives any opportunity for further review of the violation
or to contest the violation. 

Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-22 pertaining to violations of Utah's program or permit conditions
by (1) requiring at subsection (1)(d) that, where a determination is made that a pattern of violations exists has existed
and the violations were caused by the permittee's unwarranted failure to comply with Utah's program or the conditions
of the permit, the Division will request the Board to issue an order to the permittee to show cause as to why the permit
should not be suspended or revoked and provide an opportunity for a public hearing; if the permittee requests a hearing,
the Board will give notice in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; and if the permittee fails to show
cause as to why the permit should not be suspended or revoked, the Board will immediately enter an order to suspend or
revoke the permit; (2) adding the word ``district'' before ``court'' at subsection (2)(a) and clarifying that any
relief granted by the district court will continue in effect unless the Utah Supreme Court on review grants a stay of
enforcement or sets aside or modifies the Board's order which is being appealed; (3) providing at subsection (3)(a)
that a permittee or aggrieved person may initiate Board action by requesting a hearing and requiring at subsections
(3)(b) and (d) that the Board will act in accordance with its rules of practice and procedure; (4) changing terms at
subsection (3)(e) from ``issued'' to ``entered'' when describing the outcome of the Board's order and from ``administrative''
to ``adjudicative'' when describing ``proceeding;'' and (5) at subsection (3)(f), providing that the Board's action
is subject to judicial review by the Utah Supreme Court as prescribed in subsection 78-2-2(3)(e)(iv),
rather than by the appropriate district court.

Utah proposes to add new language to its judicial review of rules and orders provisions at UCA 40-10-30
by adding new language to require that (1) judicial review of adjudicative proceedings is governed by Title 63, Chapter
46b, of UAPA and provisions of Chapter 10 consistent with UAPA and (2) judicial review of the Board's rulemaking procedures
and rules adopted under Chapter 10 is governed by Title 63, Chapter 46a, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act. Utah
also proposes to revise recodified subsection (3) to require that an appeal from the Board's order will be directly
to the Utah Supreme Court and to revise recodified subsection (4) to require that an action or appeal involving the
Board's order will be determined as expeditiously as feasible by the Utah Supreme Court in accordance with subsection
78-2-2(3)(e)(iv). Finally, Utah proposes to delete existing subsection (3) pertaining to review of
the adjudication of the district court and add new language at subsection (5) to specify that, if the Board fails to
perform any act or duty that is not discretionary, the aggrieved person may bring an action in the appropriate district
court.
Utah proposes to repeal UCA 40-10-4, ``Mined land reclamation provisions applied,'' Utah Code Annotated
1953, as enacted by Chapter 145, Laws of Utah 1979. Utah also proposes to repeal UCA 40-10-31, ``Chapter's
procedures supersede Title 63, Chapter 46b,'' Utah Code Annotated 1953, as enacted by Chapter 161, Laws of Utah 1987.
Utah proposes to add new language requiring that UCA 40-10-11(5) and UCA 40-10-17(2)(t)(ii)
are repealed effective September 30, 2004.
Utah proposes the following revisions to its plan provisions.
Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-25 pertaining to lands and water eligible for reclamation by deleting,
as a priority for the expenditure of AMLR funds, existing subsection (2)(d), which pertains to research and demonstration
projects relating to the development of surface mining reclamation and water quality control program methods and
techniques, and adding new requirements for eligible lands and water to include lands and water left in an inadequate
reclamation status and which meet the criteria of subsection (4) (a) or (b). Utah proposes to allow AMLR funds to be
used for reclamation or drainage abatement at sites (1) where operations occurred during the period beginning August
4, 1977, and ending before January 21, 1981, and where funds pursuant to a loan or other form of financial guarantee
or from any other source are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site and (2) where
operations occurred during the period beginning on August 4,1977, and ending on or before November 5, 1990, and where
the surety of the mining operator became insolvent during that period, and as of November 5,1990, funds immediately
available from proceedings relating to the insolvency, or from any financial guarantee or other source, are not sufficient
to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site. Utah proposes to require that, in determining which
sites to reclaim, priority be given to those sites in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse
economic impact upon a local community. Finally, Utah proposes to provide that (1) surface coal mining operations
on lands eligible for remining do not affect eligibility for reclamation and restoration after the release of the
bond or deposit for the operation, (2) when the bond or deposit for a coal surface mining operation on lands eligible
for remining is forfeited and the amount of the bond or deposit is not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation
or abatement, AMLR funds may be used for reclamation, and (3) regardless of the provisions above that pertain to operations
on lands eligible for remining, the Director of the Division can expend monies from the abandoned mine reclamation
trust fund for any emergency requiring immediate reclamation.
Utah proposes to revise UCA 40-10-28, recovery of reclamation costs and liens against reclaimed land,
by adding new language at subsection (1)(a)(ii) to require that the sale price for land reclaimed using reclamation
funds that is sold to a State or local government for public purposes, may not be less than the actual cost of purchase
of the property by the State plus the costs of reclamation. At subsection (2)(a), Utah proposes that a lien shall not
be placed against reclaimed land where the surface owner owned the land prior to May 2, 1977, and neither consented
to nor participated in nor exercised control over the mining operation that necessitated the reclamation work.


III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h) and 884.15(a), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed
amendment satisfies the applicable program and plan approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15 and 884.14. If the amendment
is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program and plan.

1. Written Comments 
 


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record. 
 


2. Public Hearing 
 


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. on May 27, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. 
 
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions. 
 
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard. 
 


3. Public Meeting 
 


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listing under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record. 
 


IV. Procedural Determinations 
 


1. Executive Order 12866 
 


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review). 
 


2. Executive Order 12778 
 


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.
 


3. National Environmental Policy Act 
 


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal Actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Public Hearing and Reopening of Comment Period on Proposed Endangered
Status for the Hine's Emerald Dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana) 






<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.






</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and reopening of comment period.






 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that a public hearing will be held on the proposed determination
of endangered status for the Hine's emerald dragonfly (

Somatochlora hineana

) and that the comment period on the proposal will be reopened. The Hine's emerald dragonfly now persists in populations
in Cook, DuPage, and Will Counties in Illinois, and in Door County, Wisconsin. It occupies calcareous, marshy streams
associated with cattail marshes on dolomite bedrock. The public hearing and reopened comment period will allow comments
on this proposal to be submitted from all interested parties.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Hine's emerald dragonfly is known to occur in three counties in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area and in
Door County, Wisconsin. It was proposed for listing as an endangered species on the basis of evidence that its range
and numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat, and that the threats
to the habitat are continuing.

On October 4, 1993, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Hine's emerald dragonfly as endangered under
the Endangered Species Act, as amended. The original comment period ended on December 3, and the deadline for receipt
of public hearing requests was November 18. On December 10, 1993, a notice was published reopening the comment period
until January 3, 1994. The Service believes a number of parties interested in the proposed listing did not receive
notice of the proposal in sufficient time to submit comments or request a public hearing during the original comment
period. 

On December 20, 1993, the Service received requests for public hearings on this proposal from Mr. Jerome M. Viste,
representing the Door County Environmental Council, Inc., Fish Creek, Wisconsin, and Mr. George M. Reynolds, representing
Reynolds & Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Service has scheduled a hearing on May 25, 1994, from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.
C.S.T., at the Door County Courthouse, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. Those parties wishing to make statements for the
record should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral
statements may be limited to 5 or 10 minutes if the number of parties present that evening necessitates some limitation.
Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented
at this hearing or mailed to the Service. 
In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may be submitted
until June 6, 1994, to the Service office in the 

ADDRESSES

 section or at the public hearing.

Pacific Halibut Fisheries; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands; King
and Tanner Crab of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of
Alaska



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of amendments to fishery management plans; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 23 to the Fishery Management Plan
(FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 28 to the FMP for Groundfish
of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), and Amendment 4 to the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the BSAI for
review by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). The amendments would establish a moratorium on the entry of new vessels
into these fisheries. Comments are requested from the public. Copies of the amendments may be obtained from the Council
(see 

ADDRESSES

).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial
disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon reviewing the plan or amendment, immediately
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 that the plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments
received during the comment period in determining whether to approve these amendments.



The three FMPs and a companion regulatory amendment for the halibut fishery would establish a 3-year moratorium on
the entry of new vessels into the groundfish fishery of the GOA and BSAI, the king and Tanner crab fishery of the BSAI,
and halibut fishery in and off of Alaska. The purpose of the moratorium is to curtail increases in harvesting capacity
and provide industry stability, while the Council assesses long-term management alternatives for its comprehensive
management plan.

The moratorium would be implemented through the issuance of Federal vessel permits for groundfish in the GOA and BSAI,
Federal vessel permits for crab in the BSAI, and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) vessel permits
for halibut in the Convention waters in and off of Alaska. Vessel permits for these fisheries would be issued only to
vessels that had a historical landing in a moratorium fishery from January 1, 1980, to February 9, 1992.

The companion regulatory amendment would effect changes to rules governing the harvest of Pacific halibut by U.S.
fishermen in and off of Alaska. The Council does not have an FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and
off Alaska is managed by the IPHC, as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), and the Northern Pacific Halibut
Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the respective Regional Fishery Management Councils established
by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with, regulations adopted by
the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop, for approval by the Secretary,
limited access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters in and off of Alaska. ``Convention waters''
means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United States and Canada as described in Article I of the Convention
(see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). The Council acted under this authority in recommending its proposed moratorium for the halibut
fishery. Regulations governing the harvesting of Pacific halibut are set forth at 50 CFR parts 301 and 676.

Regulations proposed by the Council to implement these amendments are scheduled to be published within 15 days of
this document.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of amendments to fishery management plans and request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 30 to the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and Amendment
34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for Secretarial review; comments are requested from the public.
Amendment 30 would raise the sablefish Community Development Quota (CDQ) reserve allocation limit from 12 percent
to 33 percent. This action is intended to allow total allocation of the sablefish CDQ reserve.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon reviewing the plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the plan or amendment is available for public
review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to approve the amendment for implementation.



Amendment 30 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI would raise the allocation limit of sablefish community
development quota reserve for qualified applicants from 12 percent to 33 percent. The 33 percent limit would ensure
that NMFS would be able to allocate 100 percent of the sablefish CDQ reserves to qualified CDQ applicants. Implementation
of Amendment 30 would not change the amount of sablefish available for harvest by fishermen participating in the Pacific
halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota program. The sablefish CDQ reserve, 20 percent of the annual fixed
gear total allowable catch of sablefish for each management area in the BSAI, would be the same under the proposed action
as it is under the current FMP text. Amendment 34 to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA would correct the inadvertent inclusion
of the CDQ program in that FMP by removing and reserving Section 4.4.1.1.8 

Community Development Quotas.

 Copies of the amendments may be obtained from the Council (see

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes to issue new regulations and to amend existing regulations governing the State Independent
Living Services (SILS), Centers for Independent Living (CIL), and Independent Living Services for Older Individuals
Who Are Blind (OIB) programs. These proposed regulations are needed to implement chapters 1 and 2 of title VII of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These proposed regulations would implement chapters 1 and 2 of title VII of the Act by adding a new part 364 and revising
parts 365, 366, and 367 of the regulations governing the SILS, CIL, and OIB programs. 



The SILS, CIL, and OIB programs are an important part of the National Education Goals. These programs support National
Education Goal 6 of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act: Every adult American will be literate and will possess the
knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.


Executive Order 12866 encourages Federal agencies to solicit earlier and greater public participation in the development
of regulations. In response, the Assistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services
(OSERS) and the Acting Commissioner of the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) sent, on December 20, 1993,
over 400 letters, along with computer diskettes that included the most up-to-date draft of the proposed regulations,
to State vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, Statewide Independent Living Councils, centers for independent
living (centers), constituent organizations, and other interested parties and individuals, inviting their participation
in a series of public meetings and teleconferences on the proposed regulations. On that same date, the Assistant Secretary
of OSERS and the Acting Commissioner of RSA also made available the draft of the proposed regulations on the ``DIMENET''
and ``RSA BBS'' electronic bulletin boards. Public meetings were held on January 10 and 13 and February 1, 1994. The
teleconferences were conducted on January 24, 25, and 26, 1994. A cross section of individuals representing a wide
variety of independent living (IL) organizations and viewpoints on IL participated. In general, most commenters
were pleased with the draft regulations. The Secretary carefully considered all comments received during the public
meetings and teleconferences.

Because of the time needed to make competitive awards under part C of chapter 1 and under chapter 2 of title VII of the
Act, the Secretary proposes a 30-day comment period for these proposed regulations. As described in the ``Summary
of Major Provisions,'' the Secretary already has revised the proposed regulations in response to the extensive comments
received on the draft of these proposed regulations that was distributed to the public on December 20, 1993. In addition,
the Secretary will make this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) available through electronic bulletin boards
on the date of publication of the NPRM in the 

Federal Register

. The access numbers for the electronic bulletin boards are as follows: 




DIMENET Access Number: (508) 880-5412 
RSA BBS Access Number: (202) 205-5574 




Distribution through the electronic bulletin boards will ensure timely availability of the NPRM. Therefore, the
Secretary believes that the public interest will be served best by allowing the public 30 days to comment on the proposed
regulations. 



Summary of Major Provisions 



The following is a summary of the major provisions in these proposed regulations. The summary identifies changes
in the regulations that are mandated by changes in the statute. Other changes described in the summary are regulations
proposed by the Secretary. In addition, significant changes made to the proposed regulations as a result of public
comments received during the public meetings and teleconferences are discussed in this preamble. 
In addition, the Secretary proposes to change all references to ``individual with a severe disability'' to ``individual
with a significant disability.'' The Secretary proposes to define an individual with a significant disability to
mean an individual with a severe physical or mental impairment whose ability to function independently in the family
or community or whose ability to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment is substantially limited and for whom
the delivery of IL services will improve the ability to function, continue functioning, or move toward functioning
independently in the family or community or to continue in employment, respectively. This definition is derived
from the definition of an ``individual with a severe disability'' in section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The Secretary is
concerned that the term ``severe'' has largely negative connotations and associations in common usage and believes
that the term ``significant'' may be preferred by persons with disabilities. Consequently, the Secretary proposes
to use the term ``significant disability'' as a synonym for the term ``severe disability'' in referring to an individual's
disability. No change in meaning is intended by this change in nomenclature. 
On October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57938) soliciting comments on this proposed change. The comment period on the ``Nomenclature NPRM'' expired
on December 13, 1993. The Secretary received only 37 comments on the change proposed in the ``Nomenclature NPRM,''
with no clear majority in favor or against. These commenters expressed a wide range of views on the proposed change.
Commenters favoring the proposed change generally expressed the view that the term ``significant'' is less pejorative
than the term ``severe'' in referring to an individual's disability and, thus, would support a more positive philosophy.
These comments were generally received from commenters with an interest in the IL services and CIL programs authorized
by title VII of the Act. Commenters opposing the change raised several issues. Some suggested that the proposed change
is not technically accurate and that a change in meaning would result despite departmental assurances to the contrary.
Others suggested that the proposed change would be confusing and burdensome to implement and that the proposed change
should be made through legislation rather than through rulemaking. These comments were generally received from
commenters with an interest in the VR services programs authorized by title I of the Act. 
Also on October 27, 1993, the Secretary published a separate NPRM (58 FR 57942) on the indicators of minimum compliance
with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act. The ``Indicators NPRM'' notified the public of the ``Nomenclature
NPRM'' and advised the public to limit comments on the proposed nomenclature change to the ``Nomenclature NPRM.''
However, many of the comments received on the ``Indicators NPRM'' also included comments on the proposed change in
terms from ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Of the 102 comments on the ``Indicators NPRM,'' only 4 expressed concern
with the proposed change of the term ``severe'' to ``significant.'' Approximately 28 commenters specifically approved
of the proposed change and 24 commenters used the new terminology in their own comments, implicitly indicating their
approval of the proposed change. That is, these 24 commenters used the term ``significant'' instead of the term ``severe''
in their comments, even though they did not specifically approve of the proposed change. The remaining 50 commenters
expressed no views on the proposed change and did not use either of the terms ``severe'' or ``significant'' in their
comments. Based on the number of comments received from the IL community supporting the proposed change from ``severe''
to ``significant'' in the ``Indicators NPRM,'' the Secretary proposes to substitute the term ``significant'' for
the term ``severe'' in this NPRM. 
Further support for changing the term ``severe'' to ``significant'' in this NPRM is based on the fact that Congress
totally revised title VII of the Act when it passed the 1992 and 1993 Amendments. The argument that it would be burdensome
to implement the proposed change (e.g., because of the need to revise existing forms and reporting formats) is inapplicable
to implementation of the changes made to the IL programs by the 1992 and 1993 Amendments because the major changes to
title VII of the Act have necessitated major revisions to the regulations implementing title VII. Thus, States and
other recipients of funds under title VII will have to make extensive revisions (e.g., in existing regulations, forms,
and reporting formats) to be consistent with these changes and substituting the term ``significant'' for ``severe''
as part of these revisions would not add any significant additional burden.

Part 364



Proposed part 364 contains general provisions that would be applicable to the SILS and CIL programs, authorized by
parts B and C, respectively, of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. In addition, some provisions in proposed part 364 also
are made specifically applicable to the OIB program authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act.

Proposed  364.4 lists the definitions that apply to these programs, including ``administrative support services,''
``advocacy,'' ``attendant care,'' ``cross-disability,'' ``individual with a significant disability,'' ``minority
group,'' ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' ``peer role models,'' ``service provider,'' ``significant
disability,'' ``transportation,'' and ``unserved and underserved.''

The definition of ``administrative support services'' is based on the State plan requirement in section 704(c) of
the Act regarding the State's role if the CIL program is administered by the State pursuant to section 723 of the Act.
The definition of ``cross-disability'' is based on section 725(b)(2) of the Act. The definition of an ``individual
with a significant disability'' is the definition of ``individual with a severe disability'' used in section 7(15)(B)
of the Act. The definition of ``service provider'' is derived from the manner in which this term is used in section 704(e)
of the Act. The definition of ``significant disability'' is derived from section 7(15)(B) of the Act. The definition
of ``unserved and underserved'' is derived from sections 704(l), 713(7), and 725(c)(10) and (11) of the Act and the
legislative history of these statutory provisions.

The definitions of ``attendant care'' and ``transportation'' are based on the definitions of these terms found in
 365.1(c)(3) of the existing regulations for the SILS. The definition of ``advocacy'' is the same definition
used in the Client Assistance Program (CAP) authorized under section 112 of the Act. The definition of ``minority
group'' is based on the general definition of this term used by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Finally, the
definitions of ``nonresidential,'' ``peer relationships,'' and ``peer role models'' are derived from the generally
accepted understanding of these terms in the IL community.

Proposed  364.5 would not allow the use of expenditures made with non-Federal funds in a particular fiscal year
as an allowable cost to offset any costs disallowed in a notice of disallowance decision or preliminary departmental
decision unless the expenditures were reported as costs charged to the program on the final financial status reports
for that program prior to the commencement of the audit or compliance review that formed the basis for the disallowance.
This provision is designed to lessen the confusion surrounding the use of unreported costs as an offset against disallowed
costs and to lessen the litigation costs associated with this practice. This provision also incorporates the Department's
current practice with respect to programs under the Act.

Proposed  364.6 would define and address the use of ``program income'' for grantees under the IL programs authorized
under title VII of the Act. Program income could be used for additional program expenditures or as a deduction from
total allowable costs, but not to meet the non-Federal share requirement under 34 CFR 365.12(b).

Proposed  364.7 would incorporate section 19 of the Act that permits the carryover of unobligated Federal funds
from one fiscal year to the next. However, pursuant to the 1993 Amendments, proposed  364.7(b) would not permit
recipients of discretionary grants under sections 722 and 752 of the Act to carry over Federal funds.

Proposed  364.13 would implement section 706(a) of the Act concerning when the Secretary may withhold, reduce,
limit, or terminate payments to a State under chapter 1 of title VII of the Act. The Secretary has revised proposed  364.13
to make it more consistent with section 107(c), which is incorporated into title VII of the Act through section 706(a)(2)(A).

Proposed  364.20 would implement the State plan requirements in section 704 of the Act. These requirements
relate to the State plan's form and content, duration (three years), development, and periodic review and revision
(at least once every three years), and to public hearings on the State plan.

Proposed  364.20(c) would incorporate the requirement in section 704(a)(2) of the Act that the designated
State unit (DSU) and the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC) must jointly develop the State's IL plan and
that the Director of the DSU and the chairperson of the SILC must jointly sign the State's IL plan.

Proposed   364.20(d) and 364.22(c) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 704(a) as
it applies to the development and submission of a State's IL plan under section 704 of the Act and part 364. Section 704
of the Act requires a single State IL plan to be developed and signed by the DSU and the SILC. Nothing in the language of
section 704 permits a DSU for individuals who are blind to submit a separate State IL plan for serving individuals who
are blind. However,  364.20(d) of the proposed regulations would require that, in a State where there is a separate
State agency that is the sole State agency authorized by law to provide IL services to individuals who are blind, that
separate agency for individuals who are blind also must be included in the development of, and sign, the State IL plan.

Proposed  364.20(e) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU actively consults with the Director
of the CAP authorized by section 112 of the Act during the development of the State plan.

Proposed  364.20(g) would require an assurance in the State plan that the DSU conducts public meetings to provide
all segments of the public, including interested groups, organizations, and individuals, an opportunity to comment
on the State plan prior to its submission to the Secretary and on any revisions to the approved State plan. The Secretary
revised proposed  364.20(g) to explain more comprehensively what a State is expected to do to comply with section
704 (a) and (m)(6) of the Act.

Finally, proposed  364.20(h) would require an assurance in the State plan that, at the public meetings to develop
the State plan, the DSU identifies those provisions in the State plan that are State-imposed requirements (i.e.,
requirements imposed by State rule or policy that are beyond what would be required to comply with the regulations
in proposed 34 CFR parts 364, 365, 366, and 367).

In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed  364.21
that establishes the SILC's responsibility for funds it receives under section 705(e) of the Act and protects the
SILC's independence. In addition, the Secretary has added language to this section that requires the State plan to
include a description of the resource plan for the SILC that is required by section 705(e) of the Act.

Proposed   364.23 and 364.24 would revise the staffing and staff development requirements in existing
34 CFR 365.6 and 365.7 to reflect the changes made by the 1992 Amendments (Pub. L. 102-569) and the 1993 Amendments
(Pub. L. 103-73). These requirements would apply to all service providers.

Proposed  364.23(a) would require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel
who are specialists in the development and provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities
and in the development of and support to centers for independent living (centers). Proposed  364.23(b) would
require the State plan to include an assurance that service providers have personnel available who are able to communicate
with applicants for and recipients of IL services under title VII of the Act who need special modes of communication
or whose English proficiency is limited. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary added
language to this section to include specific examples of special modes of communication that should be available
for individuals who need special modes of communication. Finally, proposed  364.24 would require the State
plan to include an assurance that the service provider has adequate staff development programs to ensure that staff
are able to provide quality services to meet the needs of individuals with significant disabilities.

These proposed staffing requirements, which are in   365.6 and 365.7 of the existing regulations for
the SILS program, are consistent with section 504 of the Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-336,
42 U.S.C. 12101-12213), and title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L. 88-352, 42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-6).
These proposed staffing requirements have proven useful in the past, and centers have identified staff development
as a significant area of need. 
Proposed  364.28 would implement the statutory requirement that a State must incorporate into the State plan
required by section 704 of the Act any new methods or approaches for the provision of IL services to older individuals
who are blind that are developed under a project funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act. A DSU would be required
to incorporate into and describe in the State plan any new methods or approaches that are developed under a project
funded under chapter 2 of title VII of the Act that the DSU determines to be effective. 
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to proposed  364.30
that would require service providers to provide information about the CAP in formats that are accessible to individuals
who seek or receive IL services. 
Proposed  364.40(a) would incorporate the statutory provision that makes any individual with a significant
disability eligible for IL services under the SILS and CIL programs. In addition, proposed  364.40(b) would
make it clear that any individual could seek information about IL services under these programs and request referral
to other services and programs for individuals with significant disabilities, as appropriate. 
Proposed  364.41 would require the State to provide an assurance that eligibility requirements are applied
in a nondiscriminatory manner and that no State or local residence requirement will be imposed for IL services. The
purpose of the prohibition on a residency requirement is to ensure continuity of services if an individual moves from
one State to another during the time he or she is receiving IL services. Proposed  364.41 is consistent with section
101(a)(14) of the Act regarding the prohibition on residency requirements for VR services. 
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has specified additional information that
would have to be included in the statement of the objectives that would be required by proposed  364.42. The Secretary
believes that the statement of objectives required by section 704(d) of the Act should reflect the importance of this
part of the State plan to the State IL services programs and address the overall goals and mission of the State's IL programs
and services, the various priorities for services and populations to be served (including the priorities established
by centers pursuant to section 725(c)(4) of the Act), the types of services to be provided, the financial plan for the
use of Federal and non-Federal funds to meet the objectives in the State plan, and how funds received under sections
711, 721, and 752 of the Act will further the objectives in the State plan. 
Proposed  364.43(b) would incorporate the statutory requirements in section 704(e) and (f) of the Act. Section
704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals with a significant disability with
Federal, State, or other funds. Proposed  364.43(b) would permit a State to meet its statutory mandate under
section 704(e) with Federal, State, or other funds. 
Proposed  364.43(e) would incorporate the statutory requirement in section 725(b)(2) of the Act that, in the
determination of eligibility, if a State contracts with or awards a grant for the general operation of a center, it
must delegate to the center all functions related to the determination of eligibility for services. If a State contracts
with or awards a grant for the provision of specific IL services to individuals, the State may choose either to delegate
to the IL service provider all authority for the determination of eligibility for these services and for the development
of an IL plan for individuals receiving these services or to retain this authority. 


Proposed   364.50 through 364.56 would impose post-award conditions on the State and its subgrantees
or contractors regarding the processing of referrals and applications ( 364.50), determinations of eligibility
and ineligibility ( 364.51), initiation and development of an IL plan ( 364.52), maintenance of consumer
service records ( 364.53), prohibition on durational limitations for IL services ( 364.54), compliance
with standards for service providers ( 364.55), and procedures for the protection, use, and release of personal
information ( 364.56). 
Proposed   364.51, 364.52, and 364.53 would incorporate sections 704(e) and 725(b)(2) of the Act. In
addition, proposed  364.53 would be consistent with the proposed indicators of what constitutes compliance
with the evaluation standards in section 725(b) of the Act.

Proposed   364.54, 364.55, and 364.56 would keep important protections for consumers of IL services
that exist in the current SILS regulations. In particular, the Secretary revised proposed  364.56 to make it
more consistent with the current SILS regulations. 
Proposed  364.57 also would permit the DSU to delegate its functions and responsibilities under proposed   364.50,
364.51 (subject to proposed  364.43(d)), 364.52, 364.53, and 364.56 to the service provider to which the DSU
awards a grant or with which the DSU contracts to provide IL services in the State. Allowing the DSUs to delegate these
functions and responsibilities permits the States greater flexibility in the operation of the SILS program. 
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added a new proposed  364.58 that would
require each service provider to establish appeals procedures and policies that an individual could use to obtain
review of decisions made by the service provider concerning the individual's request for IL services or the provision
of IL services to the individual. Proposed  364.58 also would require the service provider to inform each individual
who seeks or receives IL services about those appeals procedures and policies in formats that are accessible to individuals
who seek or receive IL services. 
Proposed  364.59 would require a State to include in its State plan any financial needs test that would be used
by a service provider to determine whether an individual with a significant disability could obtain IL services at
no cost to the individual. Proposed  364.59(d)(1) would require a service provider to maintain written policies
covering the specific types of IL services for which a financial needs test could be applied and to maintain documentation
of an individual's participation in the costs of any IL services. 


Part 365 


Proposed part 365 contains regulations for the SILS program authorized by part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act.
Pursuant to proposed  365.11(c), if a State has designated a DSU to provide IL services for the general population
of individuals with disabilities and a separate DSU to provide IL services for individuals who are blind, the State
would have total discretion, without any interference from ED, to determine how it would divide the funds allotted
to the State under part 365 between these two DSUs. The division of funds is a matter internal to the States, and the regulations
would not exclude or mandate the involvement of the SILC in this decision. 
Proposed  365.13 would impose requirements that a State would have to meet to satisfy its non-Federal share
matching requirement under section 712(b) of the Act and proposed  365.12. Proposed  365.13(b) would
prohibit a State from using cash contributions to satisfy its non-Federal share matching requirement if the contribution
is for expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood
or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship, or an individual, entity, or organization with
whom the donor shares a financial interest. Pursuant to proposed  365.13(c), the receipt of a grant, subgrant,
or contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act from
the DSU would not be considered a benefit to the donor if the grant, subgrant, or contract was awarded under the State's
regular competitive procedures. 
Conversely, proposed  365.14(a) would prohibit a State from conditioning the award of a grant, subgrant, or
contract under section 713 of the Act or a grant, subgrant, or assistance contract under section 723 of the Act on a cash
or in-kind contribution from an applicant. Proposed  365.14(b) also would prohibit an individual, entity,
or organization that is a grantee or subgrantee of the State, or has a contract with the State, from conditioning the
award of a subgrant or subcontract on a cash or in-kind contribution to the State or to the grantee or contractor of the
State. 
Proposed  365.15 would impose the restrictions in  365.14 on a State's use of in-kind contributions to
meet the matching requirement in section 712(b) of the Act. The Secretary has not proposed to impose on in-kind contributions
the restrictions in  365.13 because fewer problems have arisen in the past as a result of the use of this type of
contribution for matching purposes. 




The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would clarify
the limitations in existing 34 CFR part 365. (See existing 34 CFR 361.76, which is incorporated by reference into the
existing SILS program regulations by existing 34 CFR 365.15.) The proposed limitations would prevent States from
making awards based on an applicant's ability to contribute the matching funds rather than on the programmatic merit
of the applicant's proposal. The proposed limitations would not prohibit a State from accepting restricted contributions
for providing services or benefits to a particular individual or group of individuals. The proposed limitations
would prohibit a State only from using these restricted contributions to meet its matching share requirement if the
donor of the cash contributions has restricted their use to expenditures that benefit or will benefit in any way the
donor, an individual to whom the donor is related by blood or marriage or with whom the donor has a close personal relationship,
or an individual, entity, or organization with whom the donor shares a financial interest.

The proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement would ensure
that the services and benefits that are provided under a program funded with 90 percent Federal money would be available
to an eligible individual without regard to the individual's relationship to the donor. The proposed limitations
also would ensure that an eligible applicant that is unable to contribute the State's share of expenditures for the
program would not be disqualified from receiving a grant, subgrant, or contract under the program. To allow a State
to condition the award of a grant, subgrant, or contract on the recipient's contribution of the State's matching requirement
would be tantamount to allowing the State to impose additional eligibility requirements to participate in the program.
This action would contradict 34 CFR 76.770(g), which prohibits a State from acting in any manner that prevents eligible
applicants from applying under the program. 
Finally, the proposed limitations on the use of restricted contributions to meet a State's matching requirement
also are intended to prevent the sale of grants, subgrants, or contracts by the States to the highest bidder. ED has
always required, unless directed by law to do otherwise, that the award of grants, subgrants, or contracts by States
be made under a fair competitive process that is free from favoritism on the assumption that fair competition will
result in the best qualified applicant receiving the grant, subgrant, or contract. To allow a State to award a grant,
subgrant, or contract on the basis of the amount that the eligible applicant can contribute to the State's matching
requirement would be inconsistent with the advantages that ED has always presumed result from fair competition.

Proposed  365.16 would implement the requirements in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-87
and A-122 that the following must be treated as a reduction of expenditures charged to the grant, subgrant, or
contract awarded under part 365 and may not be used for meeting the State's matching requirement: Rebates, deductions,
refunds, discounts, or reductions to the price of goods, products, equipment, rental property, real property, or
services; and premiums, bonuses, gifts, and any other payments related to the purchase of goods, products, equipment,
rental property, real property, or services.

Proposed   365.20 and 365.21 would incorporate the requirements in sections 704(e) and (f) and 713 of
the Act. As stated previously, section 704(e) of the Act requires that the State must provide IL services to individuals
with a significant disability. Section 704(f) of the Act permits the State to provide these IL services through grants
or contracts with third parties. Section 713 of the Act permits the State to use funds received under part B of chapter
1 of title VII of the Act to provide the resources described in section 705(e) of the Act relating to the SILC and to fund
various activities related to IL services and centers. Proposed  365.20(a) would permit the State to use funds
received under part B of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act to provide the IL services required pursuant to section 704(e)
of the Act. 
Proposed  365.21(b) would allow a State to provide information and referral services independent of other
IL services. Frequently, individuals without a disability seek information from centers on behalf of an individual
with a significant disability. Allowing States to provide information and referral services furthers the dissemination
of information and the provision of IL services to individuals with significant disabilities. Proposed  365.21(b)
also would allow a State to provide information and referral services without regard to subpart G of part 366. (Subpart
G includes the indicators of what constitutes minimum compliance with the evaluation standards in section 725(b)
of the Act and was published separately in the October 27, 1993 ``Indicators NPRM'' referred to previously. When these
regulations are published in final, subpart G will be included in 34 CFR part 366, along with any changes made to Subpart
G as a result of the public comment received on the ``Indicators NPRM.'') 
Proposed  365.23 identifies the Education Department General Administrative Regulations and requirements
that would apply if a State makes a subgrant or enters into a contract. 
Proposed  365.30 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards and procedures
to be applied by the service provider to ensure expeditious and equitable handling of referrals and applications
for IL services from individuals with significant disabilities. 
Proposed  365.31 would require the DSU to develop, establish, and maintain written standards for the provision
of IL services to be met by service providers that do not meet the standards and assurances in section 725 of the Act and
Subparts F and G of 34 CFR part 366 and that are used by the DSU to provide IL services to individuals with significant
disabilities. Proposed  365.31 also would require the DSU to assure that participating service providers
meet all applicable State licensure or certification requirements. Providers used by the DSU to provide IL services
that meet the requirements of section 725 of the Act and proposed subparts F and G of part 366 would not have to meet the
standards developed by the DSU if the standards developed by the DSU are different than the Federal requirements.
The requirements for written standards in   365.30 and 365.31, which existed in the former regulations
for the SILS program, provide important protections for consumers of IL services. 


Part 366 


Proposed part 366 contains regulations regarding the CIL program authorized by part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the
Act. 
Under proposed  366.2(b), the expansion of an existing center through the establishment of a physically separate
and complete facility at a different geographical location would be considered the same as establishing a new center
for purposes of section 722(d) of the Act and proposed   366.24 and 366.25, which would establish the procedures
for making an award to a new center. This proposed provision would facilitate the expansion of the CIL program and the
establishment of statewide networks of centers through the use of the expertise of currently existing centers. However,
pursuant to proposed  366.22(a)(1), any funds received by an existing center to establish a new center at a different
geographical location pursuant to proposed  366.2(b)(2) would not be included in determining the level of
funding to the existing center in any fiscal year that the new center applies for and receives funds as a separate center.

Proposed  366.3 lists the various activities that the Secretary is authorized by statute to fund under the CIL
program. Pursuant to proposed  366.3(a), an eligible agency may use funds awarded under subpart B of this part
to carry out training and technical assistance activities described in proposed  366.11(b). Pursuant to proposed
 366.3(b), an eligible agency may use funds under Subparts C and D of Part 366 to plan, conduct, administer, and
evaluate centers, and to carry out activities that would further a center's compliance with the evaluation standards
in section 725(b) of the Act and with the assurances in section 725(c) of the Act. 
Pursuant to proposed  366.14, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed  366.15 to evaluate
applications from entities with experience in the operation of centers for awards to provide training and technical
assistance to eligible agencies, centers, and SILCs to plan, develop, conduct, administer, and evaluate centers.
The selection criteria are based on section 721(b) of the Act and  75.210 of the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR). 
Proposed   366.20 through 366.28 would incorporate the statutory requirements that apply if the amount
of Federal funds allotted to the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act to support the general operation of centers
is greater than the amount of State funds earmarked for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed   366.30
and 366.31, or that apply even if this condition is met but the Director of the DSU (Director) does not submit to the Secretary
and obtain approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed  366.32.

Pursuant to proposed  366.22(b) if, after meeting the priorities in proposed  366.22(a)(1) and (2),
there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment to fund a new center under proposed  366.22(a)(3),
the Secretary may use the excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or may reallot these funds in accordance
with section 721(d) of the Act. This proposed provision is designed to give the Secretary added flexibility to respond
to the local needs within a State. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.26, the Secretary would use the statutory selection criteria from section 722(d)(2)(B)
of the Act, as incorporated in proposed  366.27, to evaluate applications for awards to centers under section
722 of the Act. In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of the
``Extent of the need for the project'' from 15 to 20 points and decreased the value of the ``Plan of operation'' from
25 to 20 points in proposed  366.27 (a) and (g), respectively. The Secretary also has added language to the selection
criterion on the ``Extent of the need for the project'' that would encourage an applicant to provide information on
whether the applicant proposes to serve an area that has been identified in the State plan as a priority service area.


Proposed  366.28 would clarify existing authority implicit in the Act permitting the Secretary to use funds
from the allotment of one State to award a grant to a center located in another State if the Secretary determines that
the proposal of the out-of-State center to serve individuals with significant disabilities who reside in the other
State is consistent with the State plan of the State in which these individuals reside. Nothing in the Act limits the
award of funds allotted to a State under section 721 of the Act to eligible agencies only in that State. This proposed
provision would allow the Secretary to fund the most qualified applicant and would facilitate the provision of services
to unserved and underserved areas in a State in the most efficient and economical manner. 

Proposed   366.29 through 366.38 would incorporate the statutory requirements applicable if the Director
submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants under section 723 of the Act and proposed
 366.32 and the amount of State funds earmarked to support the general operation of centers is equal to or greater
than the amount of Federal funds allotted to the State for the same purpose, as determined pursuant to proposed   366.29
and 366.31. 

Proposed  366.29(a)(2) would incorporate section 723(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. Pursuant to proposed  366.29(a)(2),
if a State submits an application for a fiscal year to award grants under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR
part 366, the Secretary would determine whether the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support
the general operation of centers meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act in the second
fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds
allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28,
1992) for that preceding fiscal year. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.29(c), the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits
an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 would be considered
the ``preceding fiscal year'' for purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act. For example, if fiscal year (FY)
1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart,
FY 1993 would be the ``preceding fiscal year.'' The Secretary chose the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year
for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program as the ``preceding fiscal year'' because
that year would be the most recent year for which complete financial data would be available to the Secretary to make
his determination. The Secretary would make any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding
cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.30(a), the amount of State funds that are earmarked by a State to support the general
operation of centers would not include: (1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; (2) State funds
used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal assistance
or skills training; (3) State attendant care funds; or (4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds.
Proposed  366.30(c) implements congressional intent as expressed in S. Rep. No. 102-357, 102d Cong.,
2d Sess. 92 (1992). 

Pursuant to proposed  366.30(b), ``earmarked funds'' would mean funds appropriated by the State and expressly
or clearly identified as State expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding the general
operation of centers. ``Earmarked funds'' would be described in this manner for purposes of this proposed provision
to ensure consistency among the States for what should be included as ``earmarked funds.'' 

Pursuant to proposed  366.31, if the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section
723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 for a fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required
by proposed  366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal year, the State would be ineligible to make grants under section
723 of the Act and subpart D of 34 CFR part 366 after the end of the fiscal year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and
for each succeeding fiscal year. 






Example:

 A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer
the CIL program in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY
1996. The State could continue to award grants in FY 1997 but could not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.

Once the Secretary determines that a State failed to earmark the required amount of funds in the second fiscal year
preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program, the State would
be precluded from administering the CIL program in succeeding fiscal years. The Secretary believes that this proposed
result most clearly reflects the intent of Congress. The Secretary also believes that allowing States to re-qualify
would be disruptive to the consistent administration of the CIL program within a State. 

In those States in which there is both a DSU responsible for providing IL services to the general population and a DSU
responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, proposed  366.32(d) would provide that
the word ``Director,'' as used in subparts D and E of part 366, would mean ``the Director of the general DSU.'' This provision
is proposed because only the general agency in a State has authority under State law to provide IL services on a cross-disability
basis. However, both State units would be required to consult with each other with respect to the provision of services
for individuals who are blind. 

Because the Department distinguishes between procurement contracts and assistance contracts at the State level,
proposed  366.32(e) would permit the Director to enter into assistance contracts with centers to carry out
section 723 of the Act. The Department considers assistance contracts awarded by a State as equivalent to subgrants.
Proposed  366.32(e) would define an assistance contract awarded by a State as an instrument whose principal
purpose is merely to transfer funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act and 34 CFR part 366 to
an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the Act rather than as an instrument to procure services under specific
terms and conditions determined by the Director. If the DSU were to use an assistance contract to award funds under
section 723 of the Act, the DSU would not be permitted to add any requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance
contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance contract were a subgrant. Under an assistance
contract, the DSU would assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section 722 of the Act; i.e., the role
of the DSU would be to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract (which are established by chapter 1 of title VII
of the Act and the implementing regulations in 34 CFR parts 364, 365, and 366) are satisfied. 

Conversely, proposed  366.32(f) would implement congressional intent to prohibit the Director from entering
into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. See H.R. Rep. No. 102-822, 102d Cong.,
2d Sess. 137 (1992) and S. Rep. No. 102-357, 92. Proposed  366.32(f) would define a procurement contract
as an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the
direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes the specific services it intends
to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.32(g), in the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of an assistance
contract, the DSU would be required to follow the procedures established in proposed   366.40 through
366.45. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.34(b), if the order of priorities in proposed  366.22 is followed and, after
meeting the priorities in proposed  366.22(a) (1) and (2), there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment
under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act to fund a new center under proposed  366.22(a)(3), the Director would
be permitted to use any excess funds in the State to assist existing centers or to return these funds to the Secretary
for reallotment in accordance with section 721(d) of the Act. Proposed  366.34(b) would give the Director of
a DSU the same discretion that the Secretary would have under proposed  366.22(b). 

Proposed   366.39 through 366.45 would establish the enforcement and appeals procedures if the Secretary
or the Director determines that a center receiving funds under section 722 or 723, respectively, of the Act is not in
compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725 (b) and (c) of the Act and subparts F and G of part 366. Pursuant
to section 722(g)(1) of the Act, if the Secretary determines that a center receiving funds under section 722(a) of
the Act is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act, the Secretary is required
to notify the center of the center's noncompliance. Pursuant to section 722(g)(2) of the Act, the Secretary is required
to terminate funds 90 days after notifying a center that it is not in compliance with the standards and assurances in
section 725(b) of the Act unless the center submits a corrective action plan to achieve compliance within 90 days after
the Secretary's notification and the plan is approved by the Secretary. Proposed  366.39 (a) and (b) would implement
section 722(g) (1) and (2) of the Act. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.39(a), the Secretary would notify the center that the Secretary will offer technical
assistance to a center to develop a corrective action plan to comply with the standards and assurance. Pursuant to
proposed  366.39(b)(2), the Secretary would notify the center that termination of funds would occur within
90 days after the center received notice of its noncompliance unless the center requests a hearing pursuant to proposed
 366.39 (c) or (d). 

Proposed  366.39(c) would give a center 30 days from the date it receives the Secretary's written notice disapproving
its corrective action plan to file a formal written appeal with the Secretary. 

Pursuant to proposed  366.39(f), the Secretary would issue a written decision to terminate funds after a hearing
if the center is found out of compliance with the standards and assurances in section 725(b) of the Act and subparts
F and G of 34 CFR part 366 or the center's corrective action plan cannot be approved.

Proposed   366.40 through 366.43 would incorporate similar statutory requirements related to enforcement
and appeals procedures that the Director shall use before terminating a center's funds or taking other significant
adverse action against a center. The due process procedures in proposed   366.40 through 366.43 are designed
to provide every opportunity for a dispute between a Director and a center to be resolved at the State level before the
dispute is appealed to the Secretary. 
Pursuant to proposed  366.40(b), unless a center submits and obtains approval of a corrective action plan,
the Director would terminate all funds to a center under section 723 of the Act 90 days after the date that the center
receives the initial written notice of its noncompliance from the Director or 90 days after the date that the center
receives the Secretary's final decision pursuant to proposed  366.46(c), whichever is later. 
Proposed  366.41 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the initial written
notice sent from the Director to the center would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice
to the center of the center's noncompliance, including notice to the center that it would have 90 days from the date
of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to submit a corrective action plan to the Director and 120 days
from the date of receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary the decision described
in a Director's initial written notice. 
Pursuant to proposed  366.42, if the center submits a corrective action plan, the Director would have to provide
the center with a final written decision approving or disapproving the center's corrective action plan and informing
the center, if appropriate, of the termination of funds or other proposed significant adverse action against the
center. Pursuant to proposed  366.42(c), a Director's final written decision would not take effect until 30
days after the center receives it or, if appealed to the Secretary, until the Secretary issues a final decision. 
Proposed  366.43 describes the minimum amount of information that the Secretary believes the final written
decision from the Director would have to contain to meet the statutory requirement of providing notice to the center
of the center's noncompliance with statutory requirements, including the reasons why the Director could not approve
the center's corrective action plan, if such a plan was submitted by the center, and notice to the center that it has
the right to appeal the Director's final written decision to the Secretary. Proposed  366.44 describes the
procedures that a center would have to follow to appeal to the Secretary a final written decision from the Director.
Pursuant to proposed  366.44(a), if a Director did not approve a center's corrective action plan, the center
would be given 30 days following receipt of the Director's final written decision to appeal to the Secretary. Pursuant
to proposed  366.44(b), if a center does not submit a corrective action plan, the center would be given 120 days
following receipt of the Director's initial written notice to appeal to the Secretary. 
Proposed  366.44(c) through (f) describe how a center would file an appeal to the Secretary. Proposed  366.44(g)
would allow the center to request an informal hearing with the Secretary, to which the Director also would be invited
to attend. 
Proposed  366.44(h) would stay a Director's decision to terminate funds as of the date that the center files
a formal written appeal with the Secretary. 
Proposed  366.45 describes the procedures that a Director would have to follow upon receipt of a copy of the formal
written appeal that the center files with the Secretary. 
Proposed  366.46 describes the review procedures the Secretary would follow upon receipt of a formal written
appeal from a center.

All of the proposed provisions in proposed subpart E regarding the enforcement of statutory requirements that centers
must meet are designed to ensure due process and fairness. 
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has added language to clarify the intent of proposed
 366.50. Section 725(c)(2) of the Act requires that the governing board of a center must be composed of a majority
of individuals with a significant disability. The statutory definition of an individual with a significant disability
is limited to individuals who are receiving or who could benefit from receiving IL services. If the statutory definition
is used to determine membership on the governing board, those individuals with a significant disability who already
have gained their independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, could not be part of the majority
of the governing board. Therefore, the Secretary has added language at the end of proposed  366.50(b) that would
modify the definition of an individual with a significant disability for purposes of this proposed section only.
The proposed definition would permit those individuals with a significant disability who already have gained their
independence, either through the receipt of IL services or on their own, to be part of the majority of the governing
board. 


Part 367 


Proposed part 367 contains regulations regarding the OIB program, authorized by chapter 2 of title VII of the Act.

In addition to incorporating the definitions in proposed  364.4, proposed  367.5 includes the statutory
definitions for ``older individual who is blind'' and ``independent living services for older individuals who are
blind.'' 
Pursuant to proposed  367.21, the Secretary would use the selection criteria in proposed  367.22, which
are based on  75.210 of EDGAR, to evaluate applications for discretionary grants under section 752(b)(1) of
the Act. 
In response to public comment on the draft regulations, the Secretary has increased the value of ``Plan of operation''
from 20 to 25 points and decreased the value of ``Likelihood of sustaining the program'' from 15 to 10 points in proposed
 367.22(b) and (h), respectively. 
Pursuant to proposed  367.23, the Secretary also would consider the geographic distribution of projects in
awarding these discretionary grants. The Secretary believes that it is important to have this program operate in
as many States as possible, and this proposed provision would give the Secretary the flexibility to accomplish this
purpose. 
Finally, proposed  367.41(a)(1) would incorporate section 752(g) of the Act that gives the designated State
agency discretion to operate or administer the OIB program or projects under Part 367 through grants to public or private
nonprofit agencies or organizations. In addition, proposed  367.41(a)(2) would incorporate section 752(i)(2)(A)
of the Act that gives the designated State agency discretion to operate or administer the program or projects under
Part 367 either directly or through grants, as permitted by section 752(g) of the Act and  367.41(a), or contracts.
The general authority to operate or administer the OIB through grants or contracts given to States in section 752(i)(2)(A)
of the Act is overridden by the specific language in section 752(g) of the Act limiting a State's authority to award
grants only to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. Because Congress could have added contracts
to section 752(g) or deleted the very specific reference to public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations
in section 752(g), proposed  367.41(a)(2) permits a State to contract only with individuals, entities, or
organizations that are not public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations. However, proposed  367.41(b)
would permit States to use assistance contracts awarded by a State (which are similar to subgrants), but not procurement
contracts, in a manner consistent with 34 CFR 366.32(e) through 366.32(g). 


Executive Order 12866 


Assessment of Costs and Benefits 


These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering these programs effectively and efficiently.
Burdens specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

Clarity of the Regulations 


Executive Order 12866 requires each agency to write regulations that are easy to understand. 
The Secretary invites comments on how to make these proposed regulations easier to understand, including answers
to questions such as the following: (1) Are the requirements in the proposed regulations clearly stated? 
(2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? 
(3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or
reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections?
(A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol `` '' and a numbered heading; for example,  364.10.) 
(4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful
in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making the regulations easier to
understand? 
(5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand? 
A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand
should be sent to Stanley M. Cohen, Regulations Quality Officer, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue
SW. (room 5125, FOB-6), Washington, DC 20202-2241. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. 
The small entities that would be affected by these proposed regulations are centers receiving Federal funds under
these programs. However, the regulations would not have a significant economic impact on the centers affected because

data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct
them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. 


Intergovernmental Review 


These programs are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.

In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program. 


Invitation To Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding these proposed regulations. 
All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will be available for public inspection, during
and after the comment period, in room 3214, Mary E. Switzer Building, 330 C Street SW., Washington, DC, between the
hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.

Subpart D_Grants to Centers in States in Which State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding 


Determining Whether State Funding Equals or Exceeds Federal Funding


 366.29 

When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers? 


(a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers in a State
in a fiscal year if_
(1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants for that fiscal year
under section 723 of the Act and  366.32 (a) and (b); and 
(2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support the general
operation of centers meeting the requirements of Part C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act in the second fiscal year
preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted
to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or Part B of Title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for
that preceding fiscal year. 
(b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal
year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered the ``preceding fiscal
year.'' 

Example

: If FY 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart,
FY 1993 is the ``preceding fiscal year.'' In determining the ``preceding fiscal year'' under this subpart, the Secretary
makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide
with the Federal fiscal year. 





(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 796f-2(a)(3)) 


 366.30 

What are earmarked funds? 


(a) For purposes of this subpart, the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State to support the general operation
of centers does not include_
(1) Federal funds used for the general operation of centers; 
(2) State funds used to purchase services from a center, including State funds used for grants or contracts for personal
assistance or skills training; 
(3) State attendant care funds; or 
(4) Social Security Administration reimbursement funds. 
(b) For purposes of this subpart, ``earmarked funds'' means funds appropriated by the State and expressly or clearly
identified as State expenditures in the relevant fiscal year for the sole purpose of funding the general operation
of centers. 




(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 711(c) and 796f-2(a)(1)(A)) 


 366.31 

What happens if the amount of earmarked funds does not equal or exceed the amount of Federal funds for a preceding fiscal
year? 



If the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under section 723 of the Act and this subpart for a
fiscal year, but did not earmark the amount of State funds required by  366.29(a)(2) in the preceding fiscal
year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart after the end of the fiscal
year succeeding the preceding fiscal year and for each succeeding fiscal year.





Example: 

A State meets the earmarking requirement in FY 1994.

It also meets this requirement in FY 1995. However, in reviewing the State's application to administer the CIL program
in FY 1998, the Secretary determines that the State failed to meet the earmarking requirement in FY 1996. The State
may continue to award grants in FY 1997 but may not do so in FY 1998 and succeeding fiscal years.




(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 796f-2(a)(1)(B)) 


Awarding Grants
 


 366.32 

Under what circumstances may the DSU make grants?

must submit to the Secretary for approval an application at the time and in the manner that the Secretary may require
and that includes, at a minimum_

(1) Information demonstrating that the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general operation of centers
meets the requirements in  366.29(a)(1); and 
(2) A summary of the annual reports submitted to the Director from centers in accordance with  366.50(n). 
(b) If the amount of funds earmarked by the State for the general operation of centers meets the requirements in  366.29(a)(1),
the Secretary approves the application and designates the Director to award the grants and carry out section 723 of
the Act. 
(c) If the Secretary designates the Director to award grants and carry out section 723 of the Act under paragraph (b)
of this section, the Director makes grants to eligible agencies in a State, as described in  366.2, for a fiscal
year from the amount of funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act. 
(d) (1) In the case of a State in which there is both a DSU responsible for providing IL services to the general population
and a DSU responsible for providing IL services for individuals who are blind, for purposes of subparts D and E of this
part, the ``Director'' shall be the Director of the general DSU. 
(2) The State units described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall periodically consult with each other with
respect to the provision of services for individuals who are blind. 
(e) The Director may enter into assistance contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes
of this paragraph, an assistance contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to transfer funds allotted
to the State under section 721(c) and (d) of the Act and this part to an eligible agency to carry out section 723 of the
Act. Under an assistance contract, the DSU shall assume a role consistent with that of the Secretary under section
722 of the Act. If the DSU uses an assistance contract to award funds under section 723 of the Act, the DSU may not add any
requirements, terms, or conditions to the assistance contract other than those that would be permitted if the assistance
contract were a grant rather than an assistance contract. Under an assistance contract, as defined in this paragraph,
the role of the DSU is to ensure that the terms of the assistance contract, which are established by Chapter 1 of Title
VII of the Act and the implementing regulations in this part and 34 CFR part 364, are satisfied. 
(f) The Director may not enter into procurement contracts with centers to carry out section 723 of the Act. For purposes
of this paragraph, a procurement contract is an instrument whose principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease,
or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the DSU. Under a procurement contract, the DSU prescribes
the specific services it intends to procure and the terms and conditions of the procurement. 

(g) In the enforcement of any breach of the terms and conditions of an assistance contract, the DSU shall follow the
procedures established in   366.40 through 366.45.

(Authority: 29 U.S.C. 796f-2(b)) 


 366.34

What is the order of priorities? 


(a) Unless the Director and the chairperson of the SILC, or other individual designated by the SILC to act on behalf
of and at the direction of the SILC, jointly agree on another order of priorities, the Director shall follow the order
of priorities in  366.22 for allocating funds among centers within a State, to the extent funds are available.

(b) If the order of priorities in  366.22 is followed and, after meeting the priorities in  366.22(a)(1)
and (2), there are insufficient funds under the State's allotment under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act to fund a new
center under  366.22(a)(3), the Director may_

(1) Use the excess funds in the State to assist existing centers; or 
(2) Return these funds to the Secretary for reallotment in accordance with section 721(d) of the Act.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 HUD is proposing to amend its regulations regarding the elimination of hazards due to lead-based paint and inviting
public comments on the amendments. The amendments would remedy inaccuracies and respond to advancements in the state
of knowledge in the field of lead-based paint testing and hazard reduction. This proposed rule would amend both the
Department's basic regulation concerning lead-based paint poisoning prevention in residential structures and
additional regulations pertaining to specific programs of the Department. The changes would include revising the
definitions of an elevated blood-lead level, defective paint and chewable paint; redefining the age of concern for
children subject to lead hazards; providing definitions of hazard reduction methods; adding the option to test defective
paint surfaces and permitting the use of laboratory analysis such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS); modifying
approved abatement practices to control lead-based paint dust; revising requirements pertaining to the number
of dwelling units to be sampled under the random sampling provision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The existing lead-based paint regulations pertaining to the Department's programs were written pursuant to the
passage of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4801-4846) in the early 1970s. This legislation
required the Secretary to ``establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead-based paint
poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application
for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary.'' HUD implemented
that requirement by promulgating 24 CFR part 35 in 1976 (41 FR 28878, July 13, 1976). Part 35 includes the general procedures
for the testing and abatement of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing and applies to all programs.
Section 35.5(c), however, allows each Assistant Secretary to develop regulations pertaining to specific HUD programs.
It is the Department's intent that program-specific regulations define the conditions that require action, but
reference part 35 for specification of how the action should be conducted. 

Since part 35 was first written, amendments to it and to the program-specific regulations have been issued from time
to time in response to changes in the law and increased knowledge about the hazards and treatment of lead-based paint.
The most recent Department-wide regulatory revisions pertaining to lead-based paint were made in 1986, 1987, and
1988. Some additional revisions specific to the public and Indian housing programs were issued in 1991. However,
new legislation_specifically the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102-550;
approved October 28, 1992) (Title X)_and recent advances in knowledge have again made some of the information in the
existing regulations obsolete. Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive revision of its lead-based
paint regulations. 


The changes in this proposed rule would represent the first phase in the revision process. In the first phase, HUD would
correct certain provisions in the regulations that are clearly out of date and should be corrected as soon as possible.
Subsequent revisions will implement Title X, which establishes new requirements effective January 1, 1995. The
Department intends to issue proposed regulations implementing the new Act as soon as possible, to allow the maximum
amount of time for comment and for preparation by State and local agencies and the private sector. 
HUD welcomes comments on the regulatory revisions that are described in this proposed rule. 



Revising the Definition of an Elevated Blood-Lead Level 



Current regulations require special procedures if a child has an ``elevated blood-lead level.'' This proposed rule
would change the definition of an elevated blood-lead level (EBL) to conform to the new recommendations of the Department
of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), regarding blood lead levels that require environmental
intervention. Existing regulations define an EBL as equal to or exceeding 25 micrograms per deciliter ( u g/dl).
The Department's new standard for environmental intervention would be equal to or exceeding 20  u g/dl for a single
test or 15-19  u g/dl in two consecutive tests several months apart. 


Many people are under the impression that the CDC, in its Statement, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October
1991), effectively lowered the definition of an EBL to 10  u g/dl. It is true that the Statement indicates that ``the
overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10  u g/dl. However, the Statement does not recommend
medical or environmental intervention at levels of 10-14  u g/dl. Three reasons are given: 





First, particularly at low blood lead levels, laboratory measurements may have some inaccuracy and imprecision,
so a blood lead level in this range (10-14  u g/dl) may, in fact, be below 10  u g/dl. Second, effective environmental
and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated.
Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from
individualized follow-up required by children who have higher blood lead levels. 






(See, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Preventing
Lead Poisoning in Young Children, A Statement by the Centers for Disease Control_October 1991, page 2.) 




The definition currently used by HUD of an EBL first appears in 24 CFR 200.805. The revised definition would be included
in 24 CFR 35.3, because the definition affects all residential HUD programs. Specific program regulations could
then reference the definition in part 35 as appropriate, although some program regulations might continue to repeat
the definition.

Definitions To Be Revised 





Title X amends the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Act to change the childhood age of concern from less than 7 years of age
to less than 6 years. This change, which also reflects the advice of the CDC in its Statement, cited above, requires
revisions to HUD's lead-based paint regulations in several locations. For example, the current definition of residential
structure (24 CFR 35.3), includes a reference to nondwelling facilities ``commonly used by children under seven
years of age.'' A similar reference currently is found in 24 CFR 200.815(c), which requires that, in the case of a sale
of a HUD-owned single-family property, if the purchaser is an owner-occupant and the occupant family contains one
or more children under the age of seven years, the sale of a HUD-owned single-family property must be deferred to allow
time to check for elevated blood lead levels and test for and abate lead-based paint. A similar requirement pertains
to multifamily properties (see 24 CFR 200.820(c)(ii) and 24 CFR 200.825(c)(1)). 



HUD also would revise or add definitions of the following terms in 24 CFR 35.22: defective paint, HEPA, HUD-associated
housing, misted scraping, paint removal, replacement, and residential structure. 



Options To Test Defective Surfaces and Use Laboratory Analysis 





The proposed rule would provide an option for testing of defective paint surfaces to determine if, in fact, lead-based
paint is present; if the test results are below 1.0 mg/cm

2

, abatement is not required. For structures built prior to 1978, the existing regulations require visual inspection
for defective paint surfaces and treatment of those surfaces found to be defective. Therefore, under the existing
regulations, surfaces that are defective but do not contain lead and are not hazardous may be unnecessarily treated.
Testing the surface is the only way to determine if it is hazardous and thus requires treatment. The revision would
permit a cost review between testing and treatment without testing. 



The proposed rule also specifically would permit laboratory analysis as an approved alternative to XRF testing.
Current program regulations require the Federal Housing Commissioner's permission to use laboratory analysis
on a case-by-case basis. This has led to a burdensome and growing number of individual concurrence actions. XRF readings
are given in milligrams per square centimeter (mg/cm2), but laboratories frequently report test results as a percent
of lead by weight. Therefore, an alternative standard of 0.5 percent by weight or 5000 parts per million (ppm) would
be permitted as an alternative to the more widely used standard of 1.0 mg/cm2.



 
Approved Abatement and Dust-Control Practices 





At the time the existing regulation was written, abatement techniques were not refined and the danger of lead dust
was relatively unknown. Research and experience in both the public and private sectors have advanced the state of
knowledge on these subjects. The proposed rule would reference various abatement methods (defined in 24 CFR 35.22)
that are consistent with the HUD Interim Guidelines and In-Place Management Recommendations. The proposed rule
also would warn about the danger of lead dust. Sections 35.56(a) (1) and (2), concerning requirements applicable
to the sale of federally owned property that will be used for residential purposes, also would be amended in this proposed
rule. 




Including Up-to-Date Sampling and Testing Information 





Given the high cost of testing for lead-based paint, it is desirable to follow a statistically sound random sampling
technique that provides satisfactory assurance of detecting lead-based paint, while not requiring the testing
of all units in a multifamily property. Existing regulations for the multifamily mortgage insurance and multifamily
property disposition programs require the testing of chewable surfaces in a random sample of ten housing units in
properties of 20 units or more. For properties with fewer than 20 units, six units must be tested. These requirements
do not have statistical validity and consequently do not provide the desired degree of assurance. Using the sample
sizes and random sampling procedures in this proposed rule, if no unacceptable hazards are observed in the sample
units tested, then there would be at least 95 percent confidence that no more than 5 percent of all units or 50 units,
whichever is smaller, would have an unacceptable lead-based paint hazard. The table included in  200.820(e)
of the proposed rule was developed to achieve the 95 percent confidence level. 



As an example, the table would require that 56 units must be tested in a 600-unit development. If lead (above th e standard
of 1.0 mg/cm

2

) is not found in any of the 56 tested units, the Department can be 95 percent confident that no more than 30 units (the
lesser of 50 or 5 percent of 600) have lead levels above the standard. As a second example, 236 units (5.9 percent of 4,000)
must be tested in a 4,000-unit development. If all are below the standard, there is 95 percent confidence that no more
than 50 of the 4,000 units (the lesser of 50 or 5 percent of 4000) have lead levels above the standard. 



The size of the sample (number of units to be tested) is determined by three factors:






N = Total number of units in the project; 


k = Maximum number of leaded units (a unit with one or more components with lead-based paint at or above the standard
of 1.0 mg/cm

2

) that can be tolerated to be missed completely; 

n = Smallest number of units that must be tested to provide 95 percent confidence that the total number of leaded units
is less than ``k'', based on finding no leaded units in the sample tested.






For example, to be 95 percent confident that no more than 5 percent of 300 units have lead, then k=15; if no more than 50
out of 4,000 with lead, then k=50. 





In the usual statistical convention, ``n'' is defined as the smallest integer for which the probability of obtaining
no positives in a simple random sample of size ``n'' from a population of size ``N'', of which ``k'' are positive, is
less than 0.05. When ``k'' of ``N'' total are positive, the probability of observing no positives in a simple random
sample of size ``n'' is given by the formula:




[(N^k)(N^k^1) ... (N^k^n+1)]/[(N)(N^1) ... (N^n+1)].

<DOCNO> FR940512-1-00090 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The required value of ``n'' is obtained by successively evaluating this expression for n = 1, 2, 3, . . .,
until the value of the formula first drops below 0.05. The table in  200.820(e) of the proposed rule was generated
using this method. 





Several points need to be made about the revised table. First, for less than 20 units total, all units would have to be
tested to get the desired confidence level. Second, the percentage of units to be tested would decrease with increasing
size of the project. Third, it is apparent from the table that for values of ``N'' above 1,006, 5.9 percent of the units
would need to be tested. 



Lower sample sizes may be attractive because of lower testing costs, but that reduces the assurance that units are
not lead-contaminated. The existing procedure does not provide any identifiable level of assurance. Of course,
100 percent assurance can only be achieved by requiring the testing of all the units in a project, at much higher cost.





Other Matters



 
Environmental Impact 





A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with part 50 of this title,
which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332. This Finding
relies in substantial part on an Environmental Assessment prepared for the Lead-Based Paint Interim Guidelines.
The subject Finding of No Significant Impact is available for inspection and copying during regular business hours
in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 




Executive Order 12866 





This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory
Planning and Review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in the proposed rule subsequent
to its submission to OMB are identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection as provided under
the section of this preamble entitled ``Addresses.'' 




Regulatory Flexibility Act 





The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule is limited to implementation of statutory changes to
the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act; there are no anticompetitive discriminatory aspects of the proposed
rule with regard to small entities and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied with by small
entities. 




Executive Order 12606, the Family 





The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12506, the Family, has determined that this
proposed rule would not have potential significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The function of this proposed rule is to remedy inaccuracies in
existing program regulations and respond to advancements in the field of lead-based paint testing and hazard reduction.





Executive Order 12512, Federalism 





The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 8(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule do not have federalism implications and, thus are not subject to
review under the Order. The function of this proposed rule would be to remedy inaccuracies in existing program regulations
and respond to advancements in the field of lead-based paint testing and hazard reduction. Issuance of this proposed
rule in no way changes or affects the existing relationships among Federal, State, and local governments. 




Semiannual Agenda of Regulations 





This proposed rule was listed as Item No. 1533 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20435) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and was requested by
and submitted to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Banking, Finance
and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Act.

Purpose and scope. 




This subpart implements the provisions of 42 CFR part 90, issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant
to section 401 of the Act, which are applicable to Federal agencies and prohibit the use of lead-based paint in residential
structures constructed or rehabilitated by the Federal government or with Federal assistance. This subpart also
establishes procedures to prohibit the use of lead-based paint in all HUD-associated housing. 


4. Section 35.14 would be revised to read as follows: 




 35.14 

Requirements. 



(a) No office of the Department shall use or permit the use of lead-based paint in HUD-associated housing. 


(b) Each Assistant Secretary shall implement the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the

paragraph (b)(3) and (b)(4) as paragraphs (b)(5) and (b)(6), respectively; and by adding new paragraphs (b)(3) and
(b)(4), to read as follows: 




 35.24 

Requirements. 




* * * * * 




(b) Subject to the provisions of separate regulations promulgated with respect to any program by the Assistant Secretary
having jurisdiction over that program, the following minimum requirements shall apply to all programs: 


(1) All painted surfaces of HUD-associated housing constructed before 1978 shall be inspected to determine whether
defective paint surfaces exist. 


(2) Defective paint surfaces must either: 


(i) Be tested for lead content and, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding levels specified
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, abated as described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Defective paint surfaces
that do not contain lead-based paint do not require treatment; or 


(ii) Be abated, if defective paint surfaces are not tested. If not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be
assumed. 


(3) If defective paint surfaces are tested, testing shall be accomplished by using a portable X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analyzer or by laboratory analysis of paint samples, whichever is more cost effective. Abatement as described
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is required of all defective paint surfaces for which the test results equal or
exceed 1.0 milligram of lead per square centimeter of paint surface. If the laboratory reports the test results in
percent by weight, the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). A qualified inspector or laboratory
shall certify in writing the precise results of the testing. 


(4)(i) Lead-based paint abatement can create lead dust that is dangerous to workers and occupants, especially small
children. Abatement should be performed only by workers who are trained in managing lead hazards and are properly
protected. Abatement should not be undertaken by home craftsmen, even very skilled ones, or untrained construction
professionals. The generation and control of dust must be carefully considered when selecting the abatement method.
Dust caused by abatement shall be contained within the work area and shall not be allowed to spread to adjacent spaces
or the soil. 


(ii) Abatement shall be by covering lead-based paint surfaces, removal of paint, or replacement of painted building
components. Acceptable methods of covering lead-based paint surfaces require the use of durable materials, sealed
and caulked to prevent the escape of lead-contaminated dust. Acceptable methods of paint removal are misted scraping,
scraping with an infrared or coil-type heat gun, and chemical stripping on- or off-site. Unacceptable methods of
abatement include dry unassisted scraping; machine sanding and use of propane or gasoline torches (open flame methods);
and washing and repainting without first thoroughly removing the paint by one of the approved methods.

(iii) Appropriate action shall be taken to protect occupants, especially young children and pregnant women, from
lead hazards associated with abatement. Occupants may not enter spaces undergoing abatement. In most circumstances,
occupants must be temporarily relocated during abatement, in accordance with  35.28. 
(iv) All abatement procedures must be concluded with a thorough cleaning of all surfaces in the affected dwelling
units and common areas in order to remove lead dust. Cleanup shall be accomplished by vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum and
washing surfaces with a trisodium phosphate detergent, followed by another high efficiency vacuuming. The waste
generated by abatement shall be safely disposed of in accordance with Federal, State, and local laws. 
(v) In the case of defective paint spots of one square foot or less, misted scraping and repainting of the defective
spot is considered adequate treatment. However, treatment of defective paint spots shall include proper containment

12. Section 200.805 would be amended by removing the definition of ``Applicable surface''; and by revising the definitions
of ``Chewable surface'', ``Defective paint surface'', and ``Elevated blood lead level or EBL'', to read as follows:



 200.805 

Definitions. 




Chewable surface 

means any intact protruding painted surface up to five feet from the floor or ground that is readily accessible to children
less than six years of age. 


Defective paint surface

 has the same meaning as the term is defined in  35.22 of this title. 


Elevated blood lead level or EBL

 has the same meaning as the term is defined in  35.3 of this title. 


* * * * * 


13. Section 200.815 would be amended by revising paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), to read as follows: 


 200.815 

HUD-owned single family property disposition. 


* * * * * 


(b) For residential structures constructed prior to 1978, HUD shall cause the property to be inspected for defective
paint surfaces before the closing of the sale of the property. In the case of a sale to a non-owner-occupant purchaser,
treatment may be made a condition of sale, with sufficient sale funds escrowed to assure treatment. Defective paint
surfaces either: 
(1) Must be tested for lead content and, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding levels specified
in  35.24(b)(3) of this title, abated as described in  35.24(b) of this title; or 
(2) If not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces abated as described in paragraph
(d) of this section. 
(c) 

Chewable surfaces.

 This subsection applies to dwellings constructed before 1978, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
If the purchaser is an owner-occupant and the occupant family contains one or more children less than six years of age,
closing of the sale shall be deferred until completion of the following procedures. Where a blood lead level screening
program is determined by HUD to be reasonably available, screening of each occupant child less than six years of age
will be required. If an EBL condition is identified, HUD will cause the dwelling to be tested for lead-based paint on
chewable surfaces or follow treatment procedures. Testing shall be conducted by a State or local health or housing
agency, an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing agency, a qualified HUD inspector
or an organization recognized by HUD. Testing shall be performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by
laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive
for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight, 0.5 percent or 5000
parts per million shall be considered positive. Where lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is identified, the entire
interior or exterior chewable surface shall be treated. Treatment shall consist of covering or removal of the paint
surface in accordance with  35.24(b)(4) of this title. 
(d) 

Abatement without testing.

 In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, in lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)
of this section, HUD, at its option, may forgo testing and abate all chewable and defective paint surfaces in accordance
with the methods set out in  35.24(b)(4) of this title. 
14. Section 200.820 would be amended by redesignating paragraphs (d) and (e) as paragraphs (f) and (g), respectively;
by revising the third sentence in paragraph (a) and paragraphs (b), (c)(1), (c)(2), the second sentence in paragraph

(b) 

Defective paint surfaces. 

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, the HUD or coinsurer's architect and the sponsor's
architect shall inspect the property for defective paint surfaces before the issuance of a commitment. If defective
paint surfaces are found, testing and abatement as required by  35.24(b) of this title shall be completed before
final endorsement as a condition of the firm commitment. If defective paint surfaces are tested, a random sample of
dwelling units shall be tested as required by paragraph (e) of this section. 

(c) 

Chewable surfaces

_(1) 

Random sample. 

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested for
lead-based paint on chewable surfaces as required by paragraph (e) of this section, including a sample of common areas
and exterior chewable surfaces. Common areas included in the sample should include nondwelling facilities commonly
used by children less than six years of age, such as child care centers. All chewable surfaces in selected units shall
be tested. If none of the tested units, common areas or exterior chewable surfaces contain lead-based paint, the project
may be considered free of lead-based paint, and no further testing or abatement action will be required. If lead-based
paint is found in any unit in the sample, all units in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found
in any common area, all common areas in the project are required to be tested. If lead-based paint is found in any exterior
chewable surface, all exterior chewable surfaces in the project are required to be tested. 

(2) 

Testing requirements. 

Testing shall be performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples.
Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for presence of lead based paint. If the
laboratory reports the test results in percent by weight the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million
(ppm). Testing of chewable surfaces shall be performed by a State or local health or housing agency or by an inspector
certified or regulated by the State or local health or housing agency. The testing entity shall certify to the results
of the test. The mortgagor shall be responsible for obtaining these testing services. 

(3) * * * Treatment shall consist of covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with  35.24(b)(4)
in this title. * * * 

(4) 

Abatement without testing. 

In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, in the case of a residential structure
constructed before 1978, the developer may forego testing and abatement and abate all chewable surfaces in accordance
with the methods set out in  35.24(b)(4) of this title before final endorsement. HUD or the coinsuring lender
will reinspect all units after repair and before final endorsement. 

(d) 

EBL child. 

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, if the developer is presented with test results that
indicate a child less than six years of age living in a unit has an EBL, the developer must test defective paint surfaces
and chewable surfaces in the unit occupied by the child. If such test is positive for lead-based paint, the developer
either: 

(1) Must abate the unit surfaces in accordance with the methods set out at  35.24(b) of this title; or 

(2) If the developer chooses not to test, the developer must abate all unit surfaces. 

(e) 

Random sampling of units. 

Random sampling of housing units for testing of chewable and defective paint surfaces shall be based on the following

(4)(i) 

Chewable surfaces

. In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested
for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces in accordance with  200.820(c)(1) of this title. Testing shall be
performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of
1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight,
0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million shall be considered positive. Testing of chewable surfaces shall be performed
by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. The testing entity shall certify
to the results of the test. The owner shall be responsible for obtaining these testing services. Where lead-based
paint on chewable surfaces is identified, the entire interior or exterior chewable surface shall be treated. Covering
or removal of the paint surface in accordance with  35.24(b)(4) of this title shall be required as a condition
