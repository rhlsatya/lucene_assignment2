<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Industrial Nitrocellulose from the United
Kingdom.

 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a request by one manufacturer/exporter, the Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on industrial nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom. The review covers one
manufacturer/exporter of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period July 1, 1992 through June
30, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins during the period. 


As a result of this review, we have preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the differences
between United States price and foreign market value. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary
results. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On July 7, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 36391) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping duty order on industrial
nitrocellulose (INC) from the United Kingdom. On July 29, 1993, the respondent, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
(ICI), requested to be reviewed in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff
Act), and  353.22(a) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.22(a)). We published the notice of initiation
of the antidumping duty administrative review on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44653), covering the period July 1, 1992 through
June 30, 1993. We have now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act. 



Scope of the Review 


This review covers shipments of INC from the United Kingdom. INC is a dry, white, amorphous synthetic chemical with
a nitrogen content between 10.8 and 12.2 percent, which is produced from the reaction of cellulose with nitric acid.
It is used as a film-former in coatings, lacquers, furniture finishes, and printing inks. INC is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 3912.20.00. The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience
and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The scope of the antidumping order
does not include explosive grade nitrocellulose, which has a nitrogen content of greater than 12.2 percent. 
This review covers sales by ICI of INC from the United Kingdom entered into the United States during the period July
1, 1992 through June 30, 1993. 


Verification 


We verified the questionnaire responses of ICI's affiliate, Nobel's Explosives Company Ltd. (Nobel's) from February
7, 1994 to February 11, 1994, at Nobel's manufacturing facility in Stevenston, Scotland. We verified the responses
of ICI's U.S. affiliate, ICI Americas Inc. (ICIA) from February 21, 1994 to February 25, 1994 at ICIA's offices in Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania.

United States Price 


The Department used purchase price (PP), as defined in 
section 772 of the Tariff Act, in calculating U.S. price (USP) when the merchandise was purchased, or agreed to be purchased,
prior to the date of importation, from the producer of the merchandise through a related sales agent in the United States
by unrelated U.S. purchasers. We determined that PP was the most appropriate determinant of USP for these sales based
on the following factors: 
(1) The merchandise was shipped directly from the manufacturer to the unrelated buyer without being introduced into
the inventory of the respondent's related U.S. selling agent; 
(2) This was the customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandise between the parties involved; and 
(3) The respondent's related sales agent acted mainly as a processor of sales-related documentation and communication
links with the unrelated U.S. customer. 
Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functions of the exporter as merely having been
relocated geographically from the country of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performs them.
Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroad does not change the substance of the functions themselves.
See 

Outokumpu Copper Rolled Products 

v. 

United States, 

829 F.Supp. 1371, 1378 (CIT 1993). 
We calculated purchase price based on packed delivered prices. We made deductions for ocean freight, marine insurance,
brokerage and handling, and U.S. Customs duties and fees, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Tariff Act.
We adjusted ICI's reported U.S. interest rate to correct a minor error in the interest calculation found at verification.

We used the best information available (BIA) for marine insurance. At verification we discovered that ICI had failed
to report that it obtains marine insurance from a related company. Further, company officials did not demonstrate
that marine insurance rates were at arm's length. In the absence of a second company involved in either this review
or the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation from which, as BIA, marine insurance rates might be selected,
we calculated a percentage of unit price based on publicly-available data as reported in the administrative review
of INC from Brazil. See Industrial Nitrocellulose from Brazil: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review, (58 FR 27537) May 10, 1993. 

We made an addition to USP for value-added taxes (VAT) in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Tariff Act. In
making our adjustment for VAT, we followed the instructions of the United States Court of International Trade (CIT)
in 

Federal Mogul Corp. and the Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 

834 F.Supp. 1391 (CIT 1993). The Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the
price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied
to foreign market sales. 
The Department also adjusted the tax amount calculated for USP and the amount of tax included in foreign market value
(FMV). We deducted the portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax that are the result of expenses that are included
in the foreign market price used to calculate foreign market tax and in the USP used to calculate the USP tax. Because
these expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP, these adjustments are necessary to prevent our new methodology
for calculating the USP tax from creating dumping margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon
foreign market sales. 
We disagree with ICI's claim that certain sales, that were sold to a related party and further processed in the United
States before sale to the first unrelated party, were PP sales.

We used BIA for these exporter's sales price (ESP) sales, because ICI failed to answer the Department's further manufacturing
questionnaire for these sales and to provide prices to the first unrelated purchaser. ICI stated that it was either
impossible or extremely difficult to answer the questionnaire, and, instead, provided a small amount of financial
and manufacturing information for the related company responsible for the ESP sales. 
At verification, we explored with ICI the reasons it provided for not responding to the further manufacturing questionnaire.
We were told that providing the specific further processing information requested by the Department would take an
excessive amount of time. We reviewed documentation that demonstrated that the production of the further processed
product involves a series of steps. At each intermediary step, chemicals and compounds are combined to produce new
compounds that will be mixed with other compounds in the next step. As a result, to determine the amount of INC used in
the final product, and to determine which products use INC, would require a complicated trace back through multiple
intermediary steps. (See Report on Verification of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March
24, 1994, 26-27.) However, our verification established that ICI had the documentation needed to fulfill the
Department's request for further processing information. ICI's claim appears to be based solely on the time and resources
that would be required to provide the requested information. We, therefore, conclude that it would not have been impossible
for ICI to have answered the further manufacturing questionnaire, and that doing so would have been no less burdensome
for ICI than for respondents in other cases who are asked to answer further manufacturing questionnaires. (See Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews and Revocation in Part of an Antidumping Duty Order; Antifriction
Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Romania, Singapore,
Sweden, Thailand and the United Kingdom, (59 FR 39729) July 26, 1993.) 
Since ICI could have, but did not, provide the data, we have used non-cooperative BIA for these sales. There were no
other firms involved in the LTFV investigation or in this first review. We have therefore used ICI's rate from the final
determination in the LTFV investigation as BIA for these particular sales. 


Foreign Market Value 


In accordance with section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act, we calculated FMV based on home market sales. We did not
include sales to related parties in calculating FMV. Under 19 CFR 353.45, the Department may disregard transactions
between related parties if the price does not fairly reflect the usual price at which sales are made to unrelated parties.
We performed an analysis of related party prices and found that they were not at arm's length. (See Memorandum to the
File, April 15, 1994.) 
As in the LTFV investigation, product comparisons were made on the basis of the following criteria: nitrogen percentage,
viscosity rating, wetting agent type, cellulose source, physical form, and wetting agent percentage. (See Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Industrial Nitrocellulose from the United Kingdom, 55 FR 21055 (May
22, 1990). Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market with which to compare merchandise
sold in the United States, sales of the most similar merchandise were compared on the basis of the characteristics
described above. In those instances, we made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the
merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Tariff Act. 
We calculated FMV based on packed and either delivered or ex-works prices to unrelated customers in the United Kingdom.
We made deductions for home market packing, inland freight, and rebates, and added U.S. packing costs in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Tariff Act. 
When a commission was paid on a PP sale but not on the home market sale, we added the amount of the commission to the FMV
and then deducted from FMV the lesser of either total home market indirect selling expenses or the U.S. commission
amount, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1).

<DOCNO> FR940512-2-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-2-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As a result of verification, we adjusted home market indirect selling expenses, packing, and credit costs which had
been incorrectly or inappropriately quantified. Although we were able to verify ICI's home market packing expenses
for the period December 1, 1992-June 30, 1993, we were unable to verify ICI's claimed home market packing costs
for the July 1, 1992-November 30, 1992 portion of the period of review (POR). (See Report on Verification of Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC and ICI Americas Inc., March 24, 1994, 9-12, and Memorandum from Case Analyst to the
File, April 15, 1994.) We used BIA for all home market packing expenses for sales made between July 1, 1992 and November
30, 1992. Because respondents claimed that drums were reused once during this five-month period, as BIA we have used
the verified packing costs for the latter part of the POR (adjusted as described below) and divided that amount by two,
to account for the reuse of packing drums during the first half of the POR. 
During the verification of ICI, the Department discovered that the costs of at least some of the drums purchased in
May 1993 were overstated. A number of purchases of steel drums were made during that month. At one point during the month,
the price of the drums increased. Rather than determining an average price, ICI selected the higher price as representative
for the entire month of May. From the information provided at verification, we could not determine how many drums were
purchased at the lower price and how many were purchased at the higher price. 
Therefore, as BIA for all May 1993 home market sales, we have used the lower price for packing cost. 
In comparing home market sales to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit terms
by deducting home market credit expenses and adding U.S. credit expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2).
We have used BIA for the home market interest rate for the purposes of calculating credit and inventory carrying expenses.
ICI does not incur short-term credit costs associated with INC in either the U.S. or the home market. ICI was unable
to satisfactorily support at verification its reported claim of what its home market credit costs would have been
if short-term debt had existed during the POR. In the U.S. market, ICI established that, if short-term debt existed,
it would have been financed using a particular United Kingdom-based interest rate. For the purposes of calculating
home market credit and inventory carrying costs, we have therefore used the same United Kingdom-based interest rate
as used for U.S. credit. 


Currency Conversion 


We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the date of the U.S. sales as certified
by the Federal Reserve Bank. 

 


Preliminary Results of Review 


As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the following margin exists for the period July 1, 1992 through
June 30, 1993: 







Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice. Any interested
party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the
date of publication of this notice, or the first workday thereafter. Interested parties may submit case briefs within
30 days of the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs, which must be limited to issues raised in the case
briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. See 19 CFR 353.38. The Department will publish
a notice of final results of this administrative review, which will include the results of its analysis of issues raised
in any such comments. 
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentages stated above. The Department will issue
appraisement instructions on each exporter directly to the Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of the final results of this
administrative review for all shipments of INC from the United Kingdom entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for
consumption on or after the publication date, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit
rates for the reviewed companies will be those established in the final results of this administrative review; (2)
for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the
company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review
or the LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most
recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or
exporters will be the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation of this case, in
accordance with the CIT's decisions in 

Floral Trade Council 

v. 

United States,

 822 F.Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and 

Federal Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company 

v. 

United States,

 839 F.Supp. 864 (CIT 1993). The all others rate is 11.13 percent. These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall
remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. 
This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

ACTION: 

Notice of final results of countervailing duty administrative review and termination of suspended investigation;
fresh cut flowers from Costa Rica.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On February 10, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 6236) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the Suspension of Countervailing Duty Investigation;
Certain Fresh Cut Flowers From Costa Rica (52 FR 1356; January 13, 1987) (Agreement). We have now completed that review
and have upheld the results of the preliminary results. We have determined for the final results that the signatories
have complied with the terms of the agreement during the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition,
we have determined that the signatories of the agreement on fresh cut flowers have met the requirements for termination
of the suspended investigation.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background


On February 10, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 6236) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the agreement. We have now completed that review
in accordance with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 19 USC 1675(a) (1988).



Scope of Review



Imports covered by this review are shipments of miniature (spray) carnations, standard carnations, and pompon chrysanthemums
from Costa Rica. This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) items 0603.10.30
and 0603.10.70. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description
remains dispositive.

The review covers the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 and six programs: (1) Tax Credit Certificates;
(2) Certificates for Increasing Exports; (3) Income Tax Exemptions for Export Earnings; (4) Exporter Credit for
Sales Tax and Consumption Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases; (5) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports;
and (6) Accelerated Depreciation.



Analysis of Comments Received



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received comments from petitioner
and rebuttal comments from respondents (ACOFLOR, the trade association representing the signatories in these proceedings
and the Government of Costa Rica (GOCR)).



Comment 1:

 Petitioner argues that all Coast Rican flower producers and exporters covered by the agreement have not established
non-use of countervailable programs for a period of at least five years. Since the first administrative review, nine
companies have signed on to the agreement. Petitioner notes that  355.25(a)(2)(i) of the Department's regulations
states that a suspended investigation may be terminated if ``[a]ll producers and exporters covered at the time of
revocation by the order or suspension agreement have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise
for a period of at least five consecutive years.'' As not all current signatories were covered by the first review,
petitioner argues that they have not been found to comply with the terms of the agreement for five consecutive years.
Petitioner contends that it is not Department practice to deviate from its regulations without a demonstration that
the unusual facts or circumstances of a particular case require special consideration. Petitioner points out that
in Ceramic Tile from Mexico; Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review and Revocation in Part of
the Countervailing Duty Order (59 FR 2823, 2824, January 19, 1994) (``Tile from Mexico'') the Department found that
a company had fulfilled the five-year requirement, even though it had not been reviewed during one review period because
it did not ship during that period. The Department based this determination on the ``unusual facts and circumstances''
of the case and the lack of a clearly articulated Department policy detailing the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(a)(3).
The Department did revoke the order for this company. Petitioner also notes a Department decision to require that
separate administrative reviews be conducted for each of the review periods. (See Lamb Meat from New Zealand; Final
Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review (58 FR 45,097, August 26, 1993), and the Department's Memorandum
in that review Re: Basis for Revocation of Orders and Terminations of Suspension Agreements Under 19 CFR 355.25(a)(1)
at 4 (12/14/92) (on file in room B-099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC).

Respondents argue that the changes to the list of signatories demonstrate the effectiveness and inclusiveness of
compliance measures established by respondents to assure fulfillment of their obligations under the agreement.
Respondents contend that requiring all those who happen to appear on the list of signatories as of the period of review
to demonstrate their compliance with the terms of the agreement for a period of five consecutive years imposes an impossible
standard, especially in the case where a company was newly established during the five-year review period. Furthermore,
respondents state that the 15 original signatories have accounted for at least 85 percent of Costa Rican exports of
subject merchandise to the United States throughout the life of the agreement. Respondents argue that the 

Tile from Mexico

 case, referred to by petitioner, dealt with partial revocation of a countervailing duty order and is therefore irrelevant
to the current case. Respondents contend that the language of  355.25(a)(2), ``at the time of revocation,''
refers to the current period of review upon which the determination to terminate is based. Respondents argue that
following petitioner's interpretation would involve the parties in an endless cycle of ongoing review that the termination
provisions are intended to avoid.


Department's Position:

 We disagree with petitioner. We recognize that  355.25(a)(2)(i) appears to require that, in order for the Department
to terminate a suspended investigation, ``[a]ll producers or exporters covered at the time of revocation'' must
not have ``applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years.''
As explained below, however, the Department has determined that the strict reading advocated by the petitioner is
not required by either the statute or the Department's regulations, and would not be in accordance with the terms of
the agreement suspending the investigation in the present proceeding.
Specifically, section 704(b) of the Tariff Act provides that the Department may suspend a countervailing duty investigation
``if the government of the country in which the subsidy practice is alleged to occur agrees, or exporters who account
for 

substantially all of the imports

'' of the subject merchandise agree, ``to eliminate the subsidy completely or to offset completely the amount of the
net subsidy'' within the appropriate period of time. 19 U.S.C. 1671c(b) (emphasis added). The statutory language
has not been changed since 1987, when the suspension agreement in this case was entered into. By regulation, the Department
has defined ``substantially all'' of the merchandise in this context as meaning ``exporters that have accounted
for not less than 85 percent by value or volume of the merchandise during the period for which the Department is measuring
benefits in the investigation or such other period that the [Department] considers representative.'' 9 CFR 355.18(c).
The regulations only require the addition of new exporters in the event that the existing signatory exporters no longer
account for substantially all of the merchandise. 19 CFR 355.19(c). Consequently, for purposes of terminating a
suspended investigation under 355.25(a)(2)(i), all that is required is that the same exporters who have accounted
for 85 percent of the merchandise for a period of five consecutive years have not applied for or received any net subsidy
on the merchandise during that period.

Although not required by the statute, the Department may require new or additional producers or exporters to become
signatories to an agreement, thus raising the coverage above the 85 percent level, in order to permit more effective
monitoring of the agreement. In this case, pursuant to the agreement, the GOCR was required to notify the Department
whenever new producers or exporters exported subject merchandise to the United States, and whether those producers
or exporters had agreed to comply with the terms of the agreement. Agreement, 52 FR at 1361. To ensure that it met this
requirement, the GOCR required any new or different producer or exporter which exported a certain volume or value
of the subject merchandise to the United States to become a signatory. These new signatories were required to comply
with the terms of the agreement during each year they were covered. The new signatories which have been reviewed by
the Department provided a further track record of compliance with the suspension agreement. This provided the Department
with evidence above and beyond that required under the statute and the Department's regulations for both coverage
and termination.

Finally, we agree with respondents that the Tile from Mexico case dealt with partial revocation, 

i.e.,

 a company-specific revocation, of a countervailing duty order under  355.25(a)(3) of the Department's regulations.
The regulations contain no similar provision permitting partial termination of a suspension agreement. Therefore,
the Tile from Mexico determination does not bear on the outcome of this proceeding.

Accordingly, we have determined that section 355.25(a)(2) permits termination of a suspended investigation whenever
the Department determines that the exporters or producers that originally signed the suspension agreement have
consistently accounted for at least 85 percent of the imports of the subject merchandise for a period of at least five
consecutive years, during which time they did not apply for or receive any net subsidy on the subject merchandise.
In addition, any new signatories must be found to have complied with the terms of the agreement during the time they
are covered.

The Department has determined that throughout the life of the present agreement, including during the current review,
the producers and exporters that originally signed the agreement have continued to account for at least 85 percent
of the imports, despite the fact that new producers or exporters were added to the agreement. See Memo to the File, dated
March 30, 1994, public version on file in room B-099, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC. In addition, we
have determined that no producer or exporter covered by the agreement has applied for or received any net subsidy on
the subject merchandise during this review or during any of the previous four reviews. Hence, for a period of at least
five consecutive years after entry into the agreement, the Department has determined that the producers and exporters
that signed the agreement and that consistently have accounted for substantially all of the imports of the subject
merchandise into the United States have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the subject merchandise. Also,
the signatories that were later added to the agreement have complied with the terms of the agreement during each review
period in which they were covered. Therefore, we determine that the requirements for termination under  355.25(a)(2)(i)
have been met. 

Comment 2:

 Petitioner argues that the Department should decline to terminate the suspended investigation because all the programs
are still in existence and used by the flower producers and exporters for non-subject merchandise. Petitioner asserts
that after termination, the former signatories will continue to be eligible to receive benefits for most of the programs,
absent active ACOFLOR intervention and monitoring. Moreover, petitioner contends that termination would be inappropriate
without updated information covering the 1992 and 1993 review periods.

Petitioner argues that it is not unlikely that the flower producers and exporters will use the six programs covered
by the agreement. Specifically, petitioner makes the following arguments regarding the six programs:

(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Petitioner argues that there will be no incentive
for ACOFLOR or the GOCR to continue monitoring receipt of benefits under this program. Petitioner also asserts that
there will be incentives for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment used for the production on non-subject
merchandise, for which exemptions are allowed, to the production of subject merchandise, for which exemptions are
monitored under the agreement.

(2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Petitioner makes the same arguments as stated above for the
Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases.

(3) Accelerated Depreciation: Petitioner argues that, although the Department has found that no signatories have
used accelerated depreciation, there is no formal or informal mechanism to stop flower producers and exporters from
claiming accelerated depreciation on their tax forms.

(4) Certificates for Increasing Exports (CIEX): Petitioner argues that the CIEX program has not been terminated
because some Costa Rican exporters received CIEX benefits in 1991 through a special commission established in 1984
to pay benefits accrued in earlier years. Additionally, petitioner contends that there are no formal or informal
measures to render exports of the subject merchandise ineligible for the benefit.

<TEXT>
 

(5) Tax Credit Certificates (Certificados Abono Tributario CATs)): Petitioner contends that it is not clear that
the CAT program was terminated as it continues to undergo fundamental changes. Petitioner also urges that although
the Central Bank is not granting CATs in new export contracts, it is unclear whether the same or different benefits
could be granted without using export contracts which are currently required to obtain CAT benefits.

(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires exporters to maintain separate accounting
records for subject and non-subject merchandise. Petitioner argues that as only one company, American Flower, maintains
separate records of duty and tax exemption benefits received for exports of non-subject merchandise, the Department
cannot confirm whether flower producers and exporters have received countervailable benefits on exports of subject
merchandise. Petitioner contends that flower producers and exporters were eligible to apply for the income tax exemption
if they had tax-exempt export profits and if they segregated domestic and export sales income in calculating income
tax. Consequently, petitioner asserts, it is unlikely that new flower producers and exporters not previously subject
to the agreement will maintain separate records for the subject merchandise.

Respondents argue that the GOCR and ACOFLOR have pledged to maintain controls to monitor receipt of benefits and that
the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade. Respondents argue that it is unlikely that the
flower producers and exporters will use the following six programs after termination:

(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases: Respondents argue that, in most cases, it will not
always be feasible for flower producers and exporters to switch equipment from the production of a product which is
non-subject merchandise to subject merchandise product.

(2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on Imports: Respondents made the same arguments as above for the Exporter
Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases.

(3) Accelerated Depreciation: Respondents assert that there are two separate government agencies, Ministry of
Finance and CENPRO, which have established government controls to block access to the use of accelerated depreciation.

(4) CIEX: Respondents argue that this program was terminated in 1988. Respondents argue that even if some of the funds
authorized for this program in 1988 were not actually distributed until 1991, the GOCR made no CIEX distributions
to flower producers and exporters. The respondents also argue that the fact that such funds may have actually been
distributed in 1991 does not alter that fact that the CIEX program was effectively terminated in 1984 for lack of funding
and officially closed in 1988.

(5) CATs: Respondents argue that the only verified fundamental changes to the CAT program are those reducing or restricting
its benefits.

(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: Respondents contend that with the continuation of GOCR controls, the
GOCR will not grant exemptions unless the claimant can demonstrate that the income for which an exemption is sought
is not derived from exports of the subject merchandise. Respondents also note that this program is being phased out.



Department's Position:

 Section 355.25(a)(2) of the Department's regulations provides that the Department may terminate a suspension agreement
despite the fact that the subsidy programs have not been abolished, provided the Department concludes that the requirements
of this provision are met. As explained in Comment 1, the Department determines that the original signatories have
complied with the terms of the agreement and the requirements of  355.25(a)(2)(i). Regarding  355.25(a)(2)(ii),
ACOFLOR has certified that the signatories are not likely to apply for or receive any countervailable subsidies in
the future. The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms to ensure compliance with the agreement
will remain in place if the agreement is terminated. Furthermore, government officials stated during verification
that Costa Rican subsidies in general were being phased out. In sum, as the Department determined in the preliminary
results of review, the record contains no evidence indicating that the signatories will apply for or receive any net
subsidy on the subject merchandise in the future. 59 FR at 6238. Petitioner has offered no arguments which would reasonably
contradict this determination.

In addition, we disagree with each of the petitioner's program-specific arguments for the following reasons:

(1) Exporter Credit for Sales Tax on Certain Domestic Purchases and (2) Exporter Exemptions for Taxes and Duties on
Imports: The GOCR and ACOFLOR have certified that the control mechanisms currently in place to monitor compliance
with the agreement will remain in place so that equipment on which duties or taxes were exempted will not be switched
to the production of subject merchandise after termination.

(3) Accelerated Depreciation: We agree with respondents that there are formal mechanisms in place at the Ministry
of Finance and CENPRO to prevent flower producers and exporters from claiming accelerated depreciation. At verification,
we found that the signatories have not used the accelerated depreciation program.

(4) CIEX: We agree with respondents that this program was terminated in 1988 and that no flower producers or exporters
have received benefits from this program during the five years required for termination.

(5) CAT: We agree with respondents that all changes during the period of review to this program have reduced and/or
restricted the receipt of benefits.

(6) Income Tax Exemption for Export Earnings: The agreement requires signatories to maintain separate accounting
records of exports to receive income tax exemptions for export earnings. Contrary to the argument of petitioner,
the Department has verified that the signatories maintained these records. A company must maintain separate accounting
records in order to receive an exemption from duties on non-physically incorporated inputs. Only one company, American
Flower, maintained these separate accounting records for the exemption from duties on non-physically incorporated
inputs, and only American Flower received this exemption on duties. All companies maintained separate records of
imports eligible for tax and duty exemptions and domestic purchases eligible for tax credits on inputs physically
incorporated into exports of the subject merchandise.

Further, under  355.25(b)(2) of the Department's regulations, the government of the affected country may
request termination of a suspension agreement during the fifth and subsequent annual anniversary months of the suspension
of the investigation. In the current proceedings, the fifth anniversary month was January 1992 and the review period
for termination is January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. Therefore, contrary to petitioner's argument, the
fifth anniversary month, January 1992, and the 1991 review period is the ``time of revocation'' within the meaning
of  355.25(a)(2), and the Department may terminate the agreement without information regarding the 1992 and
1993 review periods.

Based upon the foregoing, in accordance with section  355.25(a)(2)(ii) of the Department's regulations,
we determine that it is not likely that the producers or exporters will in the future apply for or receive a net subsidy
on the subject merchandise.



Comment 3:

 Petitioner argues that the ability to export to the U.S. market is essential for Costa Rican flower producers and exporters
to remain viable. Petitioner asserts that because Costa Rican flower producers and exporters must compete with hundreds
of Colombian flower producers who dominate the U.S. market, the Costa Rican flower producers and exporters continue
to have a need for flower subsidies.

Respondents counter that throughout the life of the agreement, Costa Rican flower producers and exporters of the
subject merchandise have been able to compete in the U.S. market without receiving subsidies. They also argue that
the GOCR is committed to eliminating incentives that distort trade because they are no longer needed to maintain competitiveness,
and because they cost too much.



Department's Position:

 We disagree with petitioner. As stated in Comment 1, the original signatories still accounted for substantially
all of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States in 1991, the period of review. The Department has
determined that the original signatories have not received subsidies on exports of the subject merchandise to the
United States during at least five consecutive years. Hence, there is no evidence that Costa Rican flower producers
and exporters continue to need subsidies to compete.



Final Results of Review



After considering all of the comments received, we determine that the signatories have complied with the terms of
the agreement for the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991. In addition, we determine that the signatories
have met the requirements for termination of the agreement. The original signatories have not applied for or received
any net subsidy on the subject merchandise for five consecutive years and they have filed the certifications required
by 19 CFR  355.25(b)(2). Based on the foregoing, we determine that there is no likelihood that the signatories
will apply for or receive any net subsidy in the future. Therefore, we determine to terminate the Suspension of the
Countervailing Duty Investigation on Fresh Cut Flowers from Costa Rica. As a result, we will also terminate the reviews
in progress for the agreement covering the 1992 and 1993 periods.

The administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)(C) and 751(c) of the Tariff Act (19
U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)(C) and 1675(c)) and 19 CFR 355.22 and 355.25.

Floodplain and Wetlands Involvement for BPA's Operational Fiber Optics Project 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), DOE. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 BPA proposes to upgrade the existing operational telecommunications equipment throughout their service area (within
the states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana). This upgrade will involve replacing existing analog radios
with digital radios and fiber optic equipment. Fiber optic cable will be strung on existing structures or a new parallel
line within BPA's existing transmission line rights-of-way. 



A site specific project has been identified for the first segment of this proposed telecommunication upgrade. It
includes installing fiber optic cable and related equipment from BPA's Ross Substation near Vancouver, Washington,
to Franklin Substation near Pasco, Washington. This distance is approximately 340 kilometers (217 miles). Most
of the cable will be installed on existing structures, however, in certain areas additional poles will be needed to
carry the cable when existing towers cannot carry the additional load. The line will span both floodplains and wetlands
located in the counties of Clark, Skamania, Klickitat, Benton, and Franklin in Washington; and Sherman, Gilliam,
Morrow, Wasco, and Umatilla counties in Oregon. 

In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements
(10 CFR part 1022), BPA will prepare a floodplain and wetlands assessment and will perform this proposed action in
a manner so as to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain and wetlands. 

The floodplains and wetlands assessment will be included in the environmental assessment (EA) being prepared for
the proposed project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). A floodplain
statement of findings will be included in any finding of no significant impact that may be issued following the completion
of the environmental assessment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This EA covers two different levels of environmental analysis: One is the programmatic approach that would describe
future telecommunication upgrades throughout BPA's service area and the other is a site specific analysis covering
the first segment of a proposed upgrade from BPA's Ross Substation near Vancouver, Washington, to Franklin Substation
located near Pasco, Washington. The programmatic EA would cover a discussion of the affected environment and a general
overview of potential impacts and possible mitigation. For each segment of BPA's system proposed for telecommunication
upgrading, a site-specific analysis would be completed within a separate NEPA process. 



The site specific portion of the EA will involve crossing the 100-year floodplain of several major rivers and tributaries.
At major river crossings, the fiber optic cable would be placed on existing structures so no new towers would be located
in floodplains. The smaller rivers and tributaries would be spanned using either existing towers or new poles. The
poles would not be located within a floodplain. Potential impacts to floodplains could occur due to clearing of riparian
vegetation and improvement of access roads. However, with mitigation, impacts would be eliminated or minimized
to the fullest extent possible. The first segment of this proposed upgrade, from Ross Substation to Franklin Substation,
will cross 100-year floodplains associated with the following rivers/creeks (moving west to east): Burnt Bridge
Creek, Lacamas Creek, Matney Creek, Little Washougal River, Washougal River, Rock Creek, Wind River, Little White
Salmon River, White Salmon River, Klickitat River, Fivemile Creek, Columbia River (crossed three times), Fifteenmile
Creek, Deschutes River, Fulton Canyon Creek, Spanish Hollow Creek, John Day River, Quinton Canyon Creek, Jones Canyon
Creek, China Creek, Willow Creek, Sixmile Creek, Umatilla River. 

Permanently-flooded wetlands and small seasonal and riparian wetlands occur in the 100-year floodplains of some
of the rivers and creeks mentioned above. Several of the larger wetlands occur in sections 3, 9, 10, 16, & 17 in Township
2 North, Range 7 East, in section 31 in Township 5 North, Range 27 East, and in section 15, Township 4 North and Range 25
East. The greatest potential to affect wetlands comes from the installation of new parallel structures or access
road improvements. Affects to wetlands could include filling wetlands, alteration of plant communities, alteration
of the hydrology, or water quality degradation. These effects can be minimized or eliminated by avoiding disturbance
to wetlands through careful planning and construction methods. For more specific information on floodplains and
wetlands in the project area contact Ms. Kevin Ward, Environmental Coordinator_EFBG, Bonneville Power Administration,
P.O. Box 3621, Portland, Oregon 97208-3621, (503) 230-5511. 

Maps and further information are available from BPA at the address above.

Citizens Utilities Companies; Intention To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement


May 6, 1994.



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a new license for the Clyde River
hydropower project, FERC No. 2306. The hydropower project is located on the Clyde River in Vermont.

The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act.

The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then
be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.



Scoping



The FERC staff prepared a scoping document (Scoping Document 1) and held a scoping meeting on March 9, 1994, in Newport,
Vermont, to assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed. The results
of scoping indicated that an EIS should be prepared for this project rather than an Environmental Assessment as staff
had initially anticipated.

A revised scoping document (Scoping Document 2) will be prepared and distributed by mail to parties on the FERC service
list and mailing list. Scoping document 2 will reflect input received at the scoping meeting and comments on Scoping
Document 1, and explain why staff determined that an EIS should be prepared.

For further information please contact Kathleen Sherman at (202) 219-2834.

Certain Chemicals; Approval of a Test Marketing Exemption



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemption (TME) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-11.
The test marketing conditions are described below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME-94-11. EPA has determined that test marketing of the new chemical substance described
below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period and restrictions specified below,
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. Production volume, use, and the
number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions and restrictions described
in the application and in this notice must be met. 
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. NEB-607 at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding
legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemption if comments are received which cast significant
doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
The following additional restrictions apply to TME-94-11. A bill of lading accompanying each shipment
must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition, the applicant shall
maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them available for inspection
or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
1.  Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture.
2.  Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
3.  Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.


T-94-11






Date of Receipt:

 March 29, 1994. The extended comment period will close May 27, 1994.
Applicant: Confidential.
Chemical: (G) Styrene-acrylic resin.
Use: (G) Electrophotographic copier toners.
Production Volume: Confidential.
Number of Customers: Confidential.
Test Marketing Period: One year. Commencing on first day of commercial manufacture.
Risk Assessment: EPA identified no significant health or environmental concerns for the test market substance.
Therefore, the test market activities will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.
The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information come to its attention which casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.

Under the provisions of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act of 1981 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Administration for
Children and Families (ACF) is requesting clearance for instruments to implement Executive Order 12862 within the
Administration for children and Families (ACF). The purpose of the data collection is to obtain customer satisfaction
information from those entities who are funded to be our partners in the delivery of services to the American public.
ACF partners are those entities that receive funding to deliver services or assistance from ACF programs. Examples
of partners are States and local governments, the territories, service providers, Indian Tribes and tribal organizations,
grantees, researchers, or other intermediaries serving target populations identified by and funded directly or
indirectly by ACF. The surveys will obtain information about how well ACF is meeting the needs of our partners in operating
the ACF programs.

<DOCTITLE>Public Meeting on the Update of Clinical Practice Guideline on Cataract in Adults: Management of Functional Impairment
</DOCTITLE>


The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) 
announces a public meeting to receive comments and information pertaining to the update of the clinical practice
guideline Cataract in Adults: Management of Functional Impairment (AHCPR Publication No. 93-0542). The AHCPR-supported
guideline was developed by a private sector panel of health care experts and consumers, and released in February,
1993. 
On August 9, 1993, AHCPR announced that it was inviting the nominations of qualified individuals to serve on a panel
as the co-chairpersons and as panel members to update a clinical practice guideline on Cataract in Adults: Management
of Functional Impairment. The update panel's tasks will be to assess new research in selected areas previously reviewed,
review current literature on new treatments, and assess new research published on the management of functional impairment
due to cataract in adults. 
A public meeting to address the update and timing of the update of the guideline, Cataract in Adults: Management of
Functional Impairment, and to provide an opportunity for interested parties to contribute relevant information
and comments, including research in areas relevant to the guideline that was not available at the time the guideline
was written, will be held as follows: 


Meeting:

 Update of Cataract in Adults: Management of Functional Impairment.

 9 a.m.-12 p.m., Conference Room G, The Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20852. 


Phone:

 301-443-2585. 


Background 


The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239) added a new title IX to the Public Health Service
Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299-299c-6 and
1320b-12.) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-410),
enacted on October 13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development
of clinical practice guidelines. 
In keeping with its legislative mandate, AHCPR is arranging for the development, periodic review, and update of clinically
relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, nurses, other health care providers, educators, and consumers
to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health care conditions can most effectively and appropriately
be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Based on the guidelines produced, AHCPR oversees development,
periodic review, and update of medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures. 
Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, requires that the guidelines:

1. Be based on the best available research and professional 
judgment; 
2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, 
nurses, other health care providers, medical educators, medical review organizations, and consumers; 
3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition-specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, educational
programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care;

4. Include information on the risks and benefits of alternative 
strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and 
management of the particular health condition(s); and 
5. Include information on the costs of alternative strategies 
for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of 
the particular health condition(s), where cost information 
is available and reliable. 
Section 914 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-3(a)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, identifies factors to be
considered in establishing priorities for guidelines, including the extent to which the guidelines would: 



1. Improve methods for disease prevention; 
2. Improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management, and thereby benefit a significant number of
individuals; 
3. Reduce clinically significant variations among clinicians in the particular services and procedures utilized
in making diagnoses and providing treatments; and 
4. Reduce clinically significant variations in the outcomes of health care services and procedures.



Also, in accordance with title IX of the PHS Act and section 1142 of the Social Security Act, the Administrator is to
assure that the needs and priorities of the Medicare program are reflected appropriately in the agenda and priorities
for development of guidelines.

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intention to accept and consider a single source application
for the award of a cooperative agreement to the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) to support the National Center
for Food Safety and Technology (NCFST), which is located on IIT's Moffett Campus in Summit-Argo, IL 60501. Competition
is limited to IIT because IIT has: the unique capability of bringing together diverse perspectives on food safety;
access to the exceptional combination of scientific expertise, pilot plants, and research facilities necessary
to focus those perspectives on cooperative food safety programs; and a cooperative food safety research program
and an academic degree program in food safety underway.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is announcing its intention to accept and consider a single source application from IIT for a cooperative agreement
to support NCFST. FDA's authority to enter into grants and cooperative agreements is set out in section 301 of the Public
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241). FDA's research program is described in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
No. 93.103. Before entering into cooperative agreements, FDA carefully considers the benefits that such agreements
will provide to the public. 



IIT's application will undergo dual peer review. An external review committee of experts in food science research
will review and evaluate the application based on its scientific merit. A second level review will be conducted by
the National Advisory Environmental Health Science Council.



I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of May 3, 1988 (53 FR 15736), FDA published a request for applications for a cooperative agreement to establish a National
Center for Food Safety which joins the resources of government, academia, and industry in a consortium to study questions
of food safety. FDA awarded the cooperative agreement to IIT in September, 1988. Applications received were competitively
reviewed by a panel of non-FDA food scientists, and the award was approved by the National Advisory Environmental
Health Science Council in September, 1988.

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 10, 1991 (56 FR 46189), FDA published a notice of its intention to limit consideration for the award of
a cooperative agreement to IIT to support NCFST. FDA awarded the cooperative agreement to IIT on September 30, 1991,
following competitive review of the application by a panel of non-FDA food scientists. The award was approved by the
National Advisory Environmental Health Science Council in September, 1991.

 Under the cooperative agreement, IIT has established and staffed the NCFST at IIT's Moffett Campus in Summit-Argo,
IL. Other participants in this effort are the IIT Research Institute, the Food Science Department of the University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, FDA, and industry. NCFST is structured so that representatives of participating
organizations play a role in establishing policy and administrative procedures, as well as identifying long- and
short-term research needs. With this organizational structure, NCFST is able to build cooperative programs focused
on food safety on a foundation of knowledge about current industrial trends in food processing and packaging technologies,
regulatory perspectives from public health organizations, and fundamental scientific expertise from academia.



II. Mechanism of Support 


A. Award Instrument 


 Support for this program, if granted, will be in the form of a cooperative agreement. In 1994, FDA is providing $2,000,000
for this award. The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that govern the research grant programs
of the Public Health Service (PHS), including the provisions of 42 CFR part 52, 45 CFR part 74, and PHS grants policy
statement. 



B. Length of Support


 The length of support will be 1 year with the possibility of an additional 4 years of noncompetitive support. Continuation,
beyond the first year, will be based upon performance during the preceding year and the availability of Federal fiscal
year appropriations.



 III. Reasons for Single Source Selection


 FDA believes that there is compelling evidence that IIT is uniquely qualified to fulfill the objectives of the proposed
cooperative agreement. IIT's Moffett Campus, where NCFST is located, is a unique research facility which includes
an industrial-size pilot plant and smaller pilot plants for food processing and packaging equipment, a biotechnology
laboratory, a packaging laboratory, analytical laboratories, offices, containment facilities, classrooms,
and support facilities which permit research from benchtop to industrial-scale. The industrial-size pilot plant
is built to accommodate routine food processing and packaging research in a commercial atmosphere. The physical
layout of the plant provides maximum versatility in the use and arrangement of equipment of both commercial and pilot
size, and in the capability to simultaneously operate several different pieces of equipment without interference
with each other. In addition to facilities to conduct routine processing research, there are facilities suitable
for more complex research, notably a biotechnology research facility, funded by the State of Illinois, for scale-up
and downstream processing and purification research. Other facilities include containment facilities in which
research involving use of components that may be potentially hazardous, such as pathogens in pasteurization or modified
atmosphere packaging research, may be conducted.

 Since 1988, IIT has provided an environment in which scientists from diverse backgrounds, such as academia, government,
and industry, have brought their unique perspectives to focus on contemporary issues of food safety. NCFST functions
as a neutral ground where scientific exchange about generic food safety issues occurs freely and is channeled into
the design of cooperative food safety programs. NCFST recently convened a meeting of its members to identify and discuss
the mechanisms and safety aspects of new food processing and packaging technologies that are either now moving into
the food manufacturing industry or are expected to be introduced soon, including laser heating, high voltage pulse
processing and high pressure processing, and cold sterilization techniques. Ongoing research on recycling plastics
for food contact use was initiated from a planning meeting that brought together NCFST participants with expertise
and knowledge about plastics recycling, including representatives of government, academia, and industry, to discuss
the status of recycling research in the U.S. industry and regulatory perspectives. The cooperative research that
was generated by this meeting has recently been expanded to include recycling of paperboard for fatty and aqueous
foods, which is a use that is not currently provided for by Federal regulations. This type of research fills existing
gaps in knowledge and expertise associated with recycled packaging materials in a time when many States are mandating
the recycling of packaging materials, and answers questions about safety and use of these materials. 

In addition to research on recycled materials for food container use, the cooperative research program in progress
investigates safety aspects of biotechnological and fermentation techniques, validation of critical controls
in computerized and automated processing lines, and formation of potentially detrimental compounds during high-temperature
processing. This cooperative research will provide fundamental food safety information in the public domain for
use by all segments of the food science community in product and process development, regulatory activities, academic
programs, and consumer programs. A particular use of this type of data by both industry and public health agencies
is in Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) programs. Food manufacturers can use the information in the
design of HACCP programs, which prevent food safety hazards before they occur and enhance the safety of the final product,
for use in their plants.

 An academic degree program in food safety science, which is not part of the cooperative agreement, has been underway
for 3 years at IIT. The program will produce graduates with a foundation in food science and technology with specialization
in food safety. Graduates from this program will manage quality control, safety assurance, and HACCP programs in
industry. They will design equipment and processes for use in the production and packaging of safe food products.
In the public sector, these graduates will evaluate the adequacy of processing and packaging parameters to produce
safe endproducts, as well as manage regulatory and information programs designed to enhance the safety of the food
supply and consumer knowledge about the food supply. Graduate students from IIT and the University of Illinois can
gain hands-on experience in food safety by participating in the cooperative food safety research program. Several
masters of science degrees, which included research conducted on cooperative projects, have been granted in disciplines
such as engineering by IIT since the inception of NCFST. 

 Collaboration between the public and the private sector is an efficient means for both to remain current with scientific
and technical accomplishments from a food safety perspective. These collaborative programs will produce generic
knowledge and expertise that can be used by all segments of the food processing and packaging industry, as well as by
public health organizations, regulatory agencies, and academic institutions in the performance of their roles
in the food science community. The trend toward use of HACCP in both the domestic and international food industry,
as a means of assuring safety of products and as a basis for harmonizing regulatory activities, is but one example of
the effects that food safety knowledge and expertise are having. Technology transfer mechanisms, which are developing
out of the cooperative food safety programs, will facilitate the movement of advanced food processing and packaging
technologies into the marketplace, while ensuring the safety of those products.



 IV. Reporting Requirements


 Program progress reports and financial status reports will be required annually, based on date of award. These reports
will be due within 30 days after the end of the budget period. A final program progress report and financial status report
will be due 90 days after expiration of the project period of the cooperative agreement.



 V. Delineation of Substantive Involvement 


 Substantive involvement by the awarding agency is inherent in the cooperative agreement award. Accordingly, FDA
will have substantial involvement in the program activities of the project funded by the cooperative agreement.
Substantive involvement includes, but is not limited to, the following: 
 1. FDA will appoint a project officer or coproject officers who will actively monitor the FDA-supported program under
this award. 
 2. FDA will have prior approval on the appointment of all key administrative and scientific personnel proposed by
the grantee. 
 3. FDA will be directly involved in the guidance and development of the program and of the personnel management structure
for the program. 
  4. FDA scientists will participate, with the grantee, in determining and carrying out the methodological approaches
to be used. Collaboration will also include data analysis, interpretation of findings, and where appropriate, coauthorship
of publications. 



 VI. Use of the Metric System



 In order to be eligible for this FDA grant program, applications must be in compliance with the Metric Conversion Act
of 1975 (as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988) which requires that the metric system be used
in all Federal procurements, grants, and business-related activities. Therefore, all applications submitted
under this notice which contain measurement-sensitive information and/or data, must reflect such data using the
metric system. During this period of transition, both metric and inch-pound units will be used simultaneously to
express measurements. Examples of measurements that should now be reflected in metrics include: (1) Travel (if applicable)
in kilometers (km); (2) office or laboratory space (if applicable) in square meters (m

2

); (3) audio/visual (film) (if applicable) in millimeters (mm); and (4) publications (if applicable) in centimeters
(cm). Applications found not to be in compliance will be returned to the applicant without consideration. Written
requests for exemption from the requirement will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If additional costs are incurred
due to implementation of this requirement, such costs may be considered as allowable if bonafide supporting justification
is presented. The grants management officer will determine the allowability of such costs.


 VII. Smoke-Free Workplace


 PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people.

Payment of a $500.00 administrative fee has been made. Having met all the requirements for reinstatement of the lease
as set in section 31 (d) and (e) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 188 (d) and (e)), the Bureau of
Land Management is proposing to reinstate the Lease effective October 1, 1993, subject to the original terms and conditions
of the lease and the increased rental and royalty rates cited above, and the reimbursement for cost of publication
of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>United States v. Electronic Payment Services, Inc.; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), that a proposed
Stipulation, Final Judgment, and a Competitive Impact Statement have been filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware in 

United States of America 

v. 

Electronic Payment Services, Inc., 

Civ. No. 94-208.
The Complaint alleges that the defendant, Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS''), the owner of the MAC automatic
teller machine network, has forced MAC member institutions to purchase ATM processing from EPS and that this is a per
se unlawful tying arrangement between regional ATM network access and ATM processing. The Complaint also alleges
that the tying arrangement is a means by which EPS has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of Ohio.
The proposed Final Judgment enjoins EPS from requiring MAC members to purchase ATM processing from EPS, requires
EPS to ensure that independent providers of ATM processing can obtain communication links to the MAC network, and
enjoins EPS from forbidding MAC members to join other regional ATM networks. 
Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section,
room 8104, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001.

Complaint


The United States of America, by its attorneys, acting under the direction of the Attorney General of the United States,
brings this civil action to obtain equitable and other relief against the defendant named herein and complains and
alleges as follows:


Nature of This Action


1. The United States brings this civil antitrust action to obtain permanent injunctive relief against an anticompetitive
practice of defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS'') that constitutes a tying arrangement that is


per se 

unlawful under Sherman Act section 1, 15 U.S.C. 1, and that constitutes a means whereby EPS unlawfully has maintained
a monopoly in access to regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') networks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of
Ohio (collectively the ``affected states''), all in violation of Sherman Act section 2, 15 U.S.C. 2.
2. EPS owns and operates the Money Access Service (``MAC'') ATM network, which has market power or monopoly power in
the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. EPS generally prohibits its customers_banks,
savings and loan associations and credit unions (collectively ``banks'') that seek to make ATM network services
available to their depositors_from obtaining ATM processing services (described at paragraph 6 below) from independent
data processing firms who seek to compete for that business. Instead EPS requires MAC customers either to obtain those
services from EPS or to provide them in-house, at a cost that is prohibitive for many smaller banks.
3. As more fully described below, EPS's tying practice not only serves to raise the cost to banks of processing services,
but also prevents banks from participating in more than one regional ATM network. Defendant thereby has maintained
its monopoly in the affected states.
4. The United States seeks a permanent injunction, pursuant to Sherman Act section 4, 15 U.S.C. 4, prohibiting EPS
from refusing to allow its customers to obtain ATM processing from third party processors; requiring EPS to connect
to those third party processors on nondiscriminatory terms; and other and further relief appropriate to remedy these
violations.

Definitions


5. ``ATM network'' means an arrangement whereby more than one ATM and more than one depository institution (or the
deposit records of such depository institutions) are interconnected by electronic or telecommunications means,
to one or more computers, processors or switches for the purpose of providing ATM services to the retail customers
of depository institutions.
6. ``ATM processing'' means providing the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services
used:
1. To operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a depository institution;
2. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to that institution's deposit authorization records,
for authorization and confirmation of ``on-us transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related
to such transactions; and
3. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to one or more branded ATM networks for authorization and
confirmation of ``on-others transactions,'' and the record-keeping and other functions related to such transactions.



ATM processing can be provided as a service distinct from branded ATM network access, and can be performed in the facilities
of the ATM switch, a depository institution's own facilities, or in the facilities of a data processing service organization.


7. ``ATM switch'' means a telecommunications and data processing facility used to receive and route transactions
from ATMs or ATM processors to data processing facilities used by depository institutions to authorize ATM transactions.
A ``MAC switch'' is an ATM switch operated by or on behalf of, or providing such functionality for branded ATM network
access to, MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant.
8. ``Interceptor processor'' means a depository institution that provides ATM processing for itself.
9. ``MAC'' means Money Access Service, the branded ATM network owned, controlled and operated by EPS, or any successor
brand to ``MAC.''
10. ``Third party processor'' means any person that currently or in the future offers ATM processing services to depository
institutions. Third party processors may include both depository institutions providing ATM processing for other
depository institutions and firms unaffiliated with depository institutions that provide such services.


Party Defendant, Jurisdiction and Venue


11. EPS is made a defendant in this action. EPS has its principal place of business at 1100 Carr Road, Wilmington, Delaware
19809. EPS is owned by four bank holding companies: CoreStates Financial Corp., Philadelphia, Pa.; PNC Financial
Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa; Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio; and KeyCorp, Albany, New York. EPS owns and operates MAC, a
regional ATM network, and other businesses. ``EPS'' and ``MAC'' are used interchangeably in this Complaint.
12. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this civil antitrust action pursuant to Section 4 of the
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 4. This Court has jurisdiction over EPS pursuant to Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 22.
13. EPS is a Delaware corporation, and is found and transacts business in the District of Delaware. Venue is proper
in the District of Delaware pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 12 and 28 U.S.C. 1491.


Interstate Commerce


14. Defendant's MAC ATM network is the largest ATM network in the United States by transaction volume. In 1992, the
MAC network handled 92 million transactions monthly for 1,455 depository institutions deploying 13 thousand ATMs.
15. The MAC network operates in interstate commerce, and defendant's practices affect interstate commerce.


The MAC ATM Network and Its Practices


16. ATMs permit a depositor, using an ATM card and personal identification number, to obtain cash, monitor account
balances, and transfer money or make payments. Some ATMs also permit customers to make deposits, and some dispense
items of value other than cash (such as travelers checks, railroad tickets, etc.) ATMs usually are owned and maintained
by individual banks, and are deployed by banks on premises and at other public locations convenient to their customers.

<TEXT>
 

17. ATMs typically are connected by telephone wires to a computer that provides processing, also known as driving,
for several ATMs. That computer often is connected to a network switch, such as the MAC switch, for interchange of transactions
among otherwise unaffiliated banks. An ATM network typically charges a switch fee per transaction, and may also charge
various monthly or annual membership fees. The processor charges a separate fee for its services. Outside the MAC
network, the driving computer might be operated by the bank, by a network, or by an independent data processing firm,
and driving computer might connect those ATMs to several different networks. MAC's rules and practices, however,
constrain interconnection of different ATM networks. 


18. Banks seek to participate in shared ATM networks, such as MAC, in order to give their depositors ubiquitous access
to their accounts. While a bank can deploy its own ATMs, the advantage to a shared ATM network is that a bank's depositors
will be able to use ATMs at many more locations than one bank alone could practicably support. The areas a bank seeks
to serve through a shared ATM network include the areas in which its depositors live, work and ship, and the broader
areas in which they move regularly. A bank's ability to offer its depositors access to other bank's ATMs, and thereby
to offer its depositors convenient access to their accounts, is in most bankers' view necessary to attract and retain
deposits. A bank_particularly a small bank, thrift or credit union with one or only a few offices_would be at a competitive
disadvantage if it could not offer its depositors access to many conveniently located ATMs. Because no other service
constitutes a reasonably close substitute for regional ATM network access, regional ATM networks constitutes a
product market and a line of commerce within the meaning of the antitrust laws. 

19. The MAC network is the dominant ATM network in the affected states. In Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, more
than 90% of the ATMs are connected to MAC; in New Hampshire, approximately 80% of the ATMs are connected to MAC. No other
regional network has a significant presence in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia or New Hampshire. Although
the New York Cash Exchange (``NYCE``) ATM network has a presence in New Jersey, for reasons set forth below, EPS's MAC
network nonetheless has monopoly or market power in New Jersey. 

20. Nearly all banks in the affected states believe they have no choice but to participate in the MAC network. Banks
in the affected states affiliate with MAC because MAC is the only ATM network that provides ubiquitous ATM network
access throughout all or most of the contiguous affected states. Banks that do not seek to provide regional ATM network
access in areas smaller than these States do not have significantly greater alternatives than do statewide banks.


21. Banks in the affected states often obtain ATM network access from MAC even though defendant's switching and processing
fees, and other costs of doing business with MAC, are higher than those charged by other networks and by independent
processors. Defendant has market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. That
market power is of sufficient size and durability to constitute monopoly power. 

22. Until 1992, MAC generally did not permit its customers to participate in rival ATM networks while also participating
in MAC. While the rule against multiple affiliations was formally dropped in 1992, MAC engages in practices that make
it impractical for many participating banks_particularly smaller banks_to belong to a rival network while belonging
to MAC. In particular, MAC requires banks either to obtain ATM driving from defendant or to provide ATM driving in-house
as intercept processors, which is prohibitively expensive for many smaller banks, thrifts and credit unions. MAC
generally forbids its network customers from obtaining ATM driving from any of the several data processing firms
that provide that service in a national market.

23. There are several regional and national firms in the business of ATM processing that could and would seek to compete
to provide ATM driving services to MAC network members. Absent MAC's prohibition, many MAC customers would seek to
obtain ATM processing from these or other firms. Defendant's rules and practices thus prevent willing buyers and
sellers from conducting business at competitively determined prices and terms. 


24. Once defendant drives a bank's ATM, defendant can prevent that bank from connecting its ATM to another network.
To connect to a network other than MAC, 

MAC 

must establish the connection. MAC generally has not provided connections to the ATM networks that would be its strongest
competitors.

<TEXT>
 

25. The anticompetitive effects of MAC's ``no-third-party-processing'' rule are twofold.

a. First, it excludes competitors from the market for ATM processing in areas where MAC has market power in the market
for ATM network access, extending the exercise of that market power into the processing market and permitting MAC
to charge higher prices_which it does both directly and indirectly; and

b. Second, by preventing many banks from participating in networks other than MAC, the rule makes it substantially
more difficult for other networks to enter into MAC's areas of dominance to compete with MAC. The rule therefore serves
to exclude competitors and maintain MAC's monopoly power.

26. The rule against third party processing is not necessary to obtain any efficiencies or quality control assurances
that could not reasonably be obtained through less anticompetitive means. MAC allows some of its largest members
to use third party processors, and permits those third party processors to connect to MAC, but will not allow those
same third party processors to prove ATM driving services to other smaller MAC customers.



First Violation Alleged



27. The United States repeats and realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 to 26 herein.

28. The provision by defendant of ATM network access and processing services pursuant to MAC's rules, constitute
an agreement or agreements within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

29. Regional ATM network access and ATM processing are separate products.

30. Defendant has market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states.

31. The amount of commerce affected in the market for ATM processing in the affected states is substantial.

32. Defendant's rules and practices act to force many of its ATM network access customers to purchase ATM processing
from defendant, rather than from other firms of the customer's choosing.

33. Defendant's tying arrangement unreasonably restrains trade and is unlawful 

per se

 under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.



Second Violation Alleged



34. The United States repeats and realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1 to 33 herein.

35. Defendant possesses substantial monopoly power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected
states.

36. Defendant willfully has maintained its monopoly power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected
states through exclusionary practices.

37. Defendant's actions and practices constitute unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.



Prayer for Relief



Wherefore, plaintiff the United States prays that:

a. Defendant be enjoined from requiring any depository institution that obtains ATM network access from defendant
to obtain any ATM processing from defendant; from selling or contracting to see access to, membership in, or switching
of transactions by the MAC network, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall
not use or purchase ATM processing services from any other person; or from restricting in any manner, directly or indirectly,
the ability of a depository institution to obtain ATM processing for access to the MAC ATM network from any person other
than defendant;

b. Defendant be enjoined to provide third party processors with nondiscriminatory access to the MAC switch that is
at least equal in type and quality to the access MAC provides to intercept processors;

c. Defendant be enjoined from discriminating in the pricing of access to the MAC network;

d. The United States be granted such other structural, injunctive or further relief as this Court may deem just and
proper; and

e. The United States recover the costs in this action.

Final Judgment



Whereas Plaintiff, United States of America, having filed its Complaint in this action on April 21, 1994, and plaintiff
and defendant, by their respective attorneys, having consented to the entry of this Final Judgment without trial
or adjudication of any issue of fact or law; and without this Final Judgment constituting any evidence or admission
by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law;

And whereas defendant has agreed to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment pending its approval by the Court;

Now, therefore, before any testimony is taken, and without trial or adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and upon
consent of the parties, it is hereby

Ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:



I


Jurisdiction



This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action and of the person of the defendant. The Complaint states
a claim upon which relief may be granted against the defendant under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.  1,
2.



II


Definitions



As used in this Final Judgment:

A. ``Defendant'' and ``EPS'' means defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc., its divisions, subsidiaries,
affiliates, agents, officers, employees, successors and assigns, and without restriction means the business currently
known as ``Money Access Service'' or ``MAC,'' its employees, agents, officers, and any successor or assign of that
business or any significant portion of the assets of that business. ``Defendant'' also includes all persons made
subject to this Final Judgment pursuant to Section III hereof.

B. ``ATM'' means automatic teller machine, a machine typically owned and deployed by a depository institution, and
used by depositors of that institution and others to withdraw cash and, in certain configurations, to perform one
or more of the following additional functions: account inquiry, payment authorization, transfer or deposit.

C. ``ATM network'' means an arrangement whereby more than one ATM and more than one depository institution (or the
deposit records of such depository institutions) are interconnected by electronic or telecommunications means,
to one or more computers, processors or switches for the purpose of providing ATM services to the retail customers
of depository institutions.

D. ``ATM processing'' means providing the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services
used:

1. To operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a depository institution;

2. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to that institution's deposit authorization records,
for authorization and confirmation of ``on-us transactions,'' and the recordkeeping and other functions related
to such transactions; and

3. To connect the ATMs deployed by a depository institution to one or more branded ATM networks for authorization and
confirmation of ``on-others transactions,'' and the recordkeeping and other functions related to such transactions.




ATM processing can be provided as a service distinct from branded ATM network access, and can be performed in the facilities
of the ATM switch, a depository institution's own facilities, or in the facilities of a data processing service organization.



E. ``ATM switch'' means a telecommunications and data processing facility used to receive and route transactions
from ATMs or ATM processors to data processing facilities used by depository institutions to authorize ATM transactions.
A ``MAC switch'' is an ATM switch operated by or on behalf of, or providing such functionality for branded ATM network
access to, the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant.

F. ``Authorization processing'' means providing the data processing services and telecommunications facilities
and services used to connect a branded ATM network to a depository institution's deposit authorization records,
for authorization and confirmation of ATM transactions, and the recordkeeping and other functions related to such
transactions.

G. ``Branded ATM network access'' means access to an ATM network identified by a common trademark or logo displayed
on ATMs and ATM cards, and includes the offering for sale of the ability for an ATM card holder with an account at one member
depository institution to request withdrawal, deposit, payment authorization, transfer or account inquiry transactions
at an ATM identified by a network's trademark or logo owned by another member depository institution; transaction
switching by an ATM switch; and the right to brand ATMs or ATM cards with the trademark or logo of an ATM network.

H. ``Depository institution'' means a bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union or other institution
authorized by federal or state law to take deposits. For the purpose of this Final Judgment, ``depository institution''
also includes any other member of a branded ATM network operated by defendant that also deploys ATMs within that network.

I. ``Intercept processor'' means a depository institution that provides ATM processing for itself.

J. ``MAC'' means Money Access Service, the branded ATM network owned, controlled and operated by EPS, or any successor
brand to ``MAC.''

K. ``MAC Midwest Platform'' means MAC's data facility (or facilities) that on October 1, 1994, provides branded ATM
network access to depository institutions located in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio
and Tennessee, and at least the greater number of the depository institutions in the State of West Virginia that are
branded ATM network customers of defendant.

L. ``Person'' means any natural person, corporation, firm, company, sole proprietorship, partnership, association,
institute, governmental unit, or other legal entity.

M. ``Third party processor'' means any person that currently or in the future offers ATM processing services to depository
institutions. Third party processors may include both depository institutions providing ATM processing for other
depository institutions and firms unaffiliated with depository institutions that provide such services. A third
party processor is ``qualified'' within the meaning of this Final Judgment if it is qualified within the meaning of
Section IV.E below.

III



Applicability



The Final Judgment shall apply to defendant and each of its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors, and assigns; to any successor to any substantial part of the MAC business; to any entity that controls
defendant as control currently is defined under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and its
implementing regulations (see 16 CFR 801.1(b)); and to all persons acting in concert with defendant and having actual
notice of this Final Judgment.



IV



Prohibited Conduct



Defendant is permanently enjoined and restrained as follows:

A. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that obtains branded ATM network access from defendant
to obtain any ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant. Defendant shall not maintain or enforce
any rule, policy, contract, agreement or arrangement pursuant to which defendant requires any depository institution
to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant; that prohibits or purports to prohibit a depository
institution from obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any third party processor; or that conditions
MAC membership or availability of MAC or any successor branded ATM network access on any depository institution's
obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from defendant or not obtaining ATM processing or authorization
processing from a qualified third party processor.

B. Defendant shall not sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or
any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the
purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing or authorization processing services from any other person.

C. Defendant shall not establish as any condition, agreement, or understanding with respect to access to, membership
in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant, or the price
or terms of such access, membership, or switching, that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase ATM processing
or authorization processing services from any other person. Defendant shall not impose any additional fees on any
depository institution based on its obtaining ATM processing or authorization processing from any person other
than defendant, except that defendant may impose additional fees for set-up and establishment of the network. Defendant
will not require an unreasonable amount of set-up and establishment testing and certification. The aggregate of
set-up and/or establishment fees charged to a depository institution, as allowed by this paragraph, and/or its third
party processor, as allowed by paragraph IV.E.2 of this Final Judgment, shall not exceed $100 per person hour expended
by Defendant up to a maximum of $1,000 unless significant difficulties that require additional work are caused by
the third party processor or the depository institution. In such case, Defendant will charge $100 per hour for the
next 40 person hours and $250 per hour for each additional hour that it expends. The hourly rates and maximum fees set
forth in this paragraph may be adjusted over the term of this Final Judgment in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.

D. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner, directly or indirectly, the ability of a depository institution to
obtain ATM processing or authorization processing for access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled
by defendant from any qualified third party processor. Defendant shall not require any depository institution that
obtains ATM processing or authorization processing from a third party processor to obtain any other service that
is not required to provide such ATM or authorization processing from that processor or from any other person.

E. Defendant shall provide qualified third party processors with nondiscriminatory branded ATM network access
to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant that is at least equal in type and quality to
the access defendant: (a) Provides to intercept processors, and (b) provided to intercept processors as of the date
of the commencement of this action. Defendant shall not deny any qualified third party processor access to telecommunications
ports or links necessary for the third party processor to provide ATM processing or authorization processing for
depository institutions obtaining ATM network access from defendant. Defendant shall permit qualified third party
processors to aggregate transactions of multiple banks over one or several telecommunications links and ports as
technically reasonable, and defendant shall not require third party processors to obtain a separate link or port
for each of its depository institution customers. A third party processor is qualified, within the meaning of this
Final Judgment, if it completes defendant's certification process and meets:

1. The technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party processors that provide
services to only one depository institution established by defendant and in effect as of the date of commencement
of this action, or such other reasonable and nondiscriminatory technical, financial and operating criteria for
intercept processors and third party processors hereafter established by defendant; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940512-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Such additional technical criteria regarding transaction information transmitted and the format for transmission
of such information as is reasonably appropriate for third party ATM processing for unaffiliated multiple banks.
No such criteria shall distinguish or discriminate between intercept processors and third party processors, except
that volume discounts may be offered in a nondiscriminatory manner as provided in paragraph IV.G of this Final Judgment.
Defendant shall not require any third party processor to satisfy additional certification requirements, or pay
additional certification fees (other than reasonable set-up fees), by reason of its seeking or obtaining the business
of additional customers as long as the processor elects to employ for these additional customers a message format/communications
protocol combination for which defendant already has certified the processor.

 


Notwithstanding the foregoing, Defendant is not required to certify as a qualified processor any branded ATM network
that is dominant on a state-wide basis or a subsidiary of such network that seeks to become a qualified processor in
the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by Defendant unless reciprocal access to become a processor
in that network is available on a substantially similar basis as to pricing and terms to all qualified third party processors
including other branded ATM networks that offer third party ATM or authorization processing to depository institutions.




F. Defendant shall not terminate any third party processor's access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM network
controlled by defendant except on written notice to the processor thirty (30) days before such termination, except
that Defendant can terminate any processor immediately if that processor: (1) Fails to pay at any time specified fees,
charges or other amounts due and owed to defendant or any participant in defendant's branded ATM network; (2) violates
any law or government regulation applicable to it that has adverse effect upon the MAC or any successor branded ATM
network controlled by defendant; (3) has a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding filed against it; or (4) appoints
or has appointed by court order a trustee or receiver for any substantial part of its property. Defendant shall provide
a copy of any notice of termination to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, to the attention of counsel
of record or their named successors. Any termination in violation of this Final Judgment shall constitute a contempt
of this Court and be punishable thereby. 
G. Defendant shall not discriminate in the pricing of branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded
ATM network controlled by defendant on the basis of a customer's choice of ATM processor, but shall offer branded ATM
network access on a nondiscriminatory basis, except that: 

1. Defendant may offer volume discounts on branded ATM network access fees on a nondiscriminatory basis, provided
that defendant shall permit any depository institution or third party processor for a depository institution to
aggregate that institution's transaction volume delivered to a MAC switch, and any such depository institution
shall be entitled to any such nondiscriminatory volume discount. Defendant shall not offer volume discounts to a
depository institution operating as an intercept processor that are more favorable than those offer to a depository
institution that obtains ATM or authorization processing from a qualified third party processor. 

2. Defendant shall be permitted to offer depository institutions the option of obtaining transaction switching
between member depository institutions by third party processors at nondiscriminatory royalties that shall not
be greater than the price for switched transactions.

<PARENT> FR940512-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

3. Defendant shall provide branded ATM network access pursuant to a nondiscriminatory price schedule applicable
at least to depository institutions located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. Defendant's
provision of branded ATM network access in States other than Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, pursuant to
a nondiscriminatory price schedule in one State, shall not be deemed to be discriminatory by reason of the use of a different
price schedule in another State.
H. Defendant shall not restrict in any manner the ability of a depository institution to obtain branded ATM network
access through qualified third party processors or through their own intercept processor facilities to multiple
providers of branded ATM network access. Defendant shall not condition its provision of branded ATM network access
on a depository institution's not obtaining branded ATM network access from any other person. Defendant shall not
sell or contract to sell access to, membership in, or switching of transactions by any branded ATM network controlled
by defendant, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase
branded ATM network access from any other person, or establish a price for, discount from, or rebate upon access to,
membership in, or switching of transactions by the MAC or any successor branded ATM network controlled by defendant,
on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the purchaser thereof shall not use or purchase branded ATM network
access from any other person. Defendant shall in no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer that
chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from displaying multiple ATM network logos on its ATMs. Defendant
shall not prohibit any depository institution ATM card issuer located in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware, Indiana or Ohio that chooses to be affiliated with multiple ATM networks from issuing cards that display
multiple ATM network logos. Notwithstanding the preceding, Defendant may require that its ATM network logo be displayed
on ATMs and ATM cards in equal frequency and prominence as the logos of any other ATM networks and may restrict the branding
of access cards that contain an integrated circuit computer chip with a stored value function. Defendant shall in
no manner restrict any depository institution ATM deployer from enabling ATMs to function in multiple ATM networks.
I. Notwithstanding the preceding, defendant is not enjoined from entering into an agreement, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Final Judgment, for the provision of ATM processing or authorization processing to any depository
institution to which defendant has provided actual notice of, and a true copy of, this Final Judgment. Any such agreement
shall be severable from any agreement to provide branded ATM network access to the MAC or any successor branded ATM
network controlled by defendant.
J. The injunctions specified in Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall become effective as provided
by the terms of this paragraph:
1. Defendant shall commence certification of third party processors not later than January 1, 1995, except that defendant
shall commence certification of processors in the MAC Midwest Platform not later than October 1, 1994.
2. Each third party processor who seeks certification shall be allowed to complete certification in a reasonably
prompt manner and within the range of time common in the industry, and shall not be denied such resources under the control
of defendant (e.g., test time) as are necessary for certification. Upon a third party processor's completion of certification,
such processor shall be permitted to act as a qualified third party processor in the MAC network, except that defendant
is not required by this paragraph IV.J.2, prior to January 1, 1995, to permit a third party processor that completes
certification in the MAC Midwest Platform to act as a qualified third party processor for depository institutions
not located in the States of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, West Virginia or Ohio, or depository institutions
located in the State of West Virginia but not served by defendant through the MAC Midwest Platform as of the date of commencement
of this action.
3. Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall be effective and in force, as to any third party processor
and the depository institution customers of such processor, as of the date upon which such third party processor becomes
a qualified third part processor.


4. Sections IV.A through IV.E of this Final Judgment shall be effective and in force as of the date of entry of this Final
Judgment in any portion of the MAC or any successor ATM network controlled by defendant in which depository institutions
had the option of using third party multi-bank ATM processors as of January 1, 1993. Defendant shall not renounce or
deny any right that it previously granted to depository institutions to obtain ATM processing or authorization processing
from third party processors.

5. Defendant shall not take steps to prevent or discontinue any existing arrangements whereby third party processors
provide ATM processing or authorization processing in connection with branded ATM network access as of January 1,
1993.



V



Sanctions



Nothing in this Final Judgment shall bar the United States from seeking, or the Court from imposing, against any defendant

Competitive Impact Statement



The United States, pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act''),
15 U.S.C. 16(b), files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry
in this civil antitrust proceeding.



I



Nature and Purpose of the Proceedings



On April 21, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint pursuant to Section 4 of the Sherman Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 4, against defendant Electronic Payment Services, Inc. (``EPS''), owner of the Money Access Service (``MAC'')
regional automatic teller machine (``ATM'') network.
 The complaint alleges that EPS's refusal to allow the MAC network's bank customers
 to obtain ATM processing services from providers other than EPS violates the antitrust laws.






The complaint's two counts allege: (1) That a business practice of EPS is a tying arrangement that is 

per se 

unlawful under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 1, and (2) that this typing arrangement is a means
by which EPS has maintained a monopoly in regional ATM network access in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
West Virginia and New Hampshire, and in substantial portions of the State of Ohio (the ``affected states''), in violation
of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 2.

The effect of this practice is to foreclose competition from competing data processing companies in the affected
states. Furthermore, because those competing data processing companies would otherwise provide means by which
MAC member banks could access competing regional ATM networks, this practice has the effect of excluding those networks
and maintaining EPS's monopoly in regional ATM network access in the affected states. The complaint seeks an injunction
prohibiting EPS from continuing the tying arrangement, and other relief.

On April 21, 1994, the United States and EPS filed a Stipulation by which the parties consented to entry of the attached
proposed Final Judgment. This Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, enjoins EPS from requiring any of its
regional ATM network customers to purchase ATM processing from EPS.

The United States and EPS have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the
Tunney Act, unless the government withdraws its consent. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment would terminate this
action, except that the Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, and enforce the proposed Final Judgment
and to punish violations thereof.



II



Facts Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation



The Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice has conducted an extensive investigation of EPS's
business practices. That investigation shows the following:



A. Background



1. 

ATMs and ATM Networks. 

ATMs are machines typically owned and deployed by banks and used by their depositors with ATM cards most frequently
to withdraw cash, but also to accomplish balance inquiries, deposits, payment authorizations, and transfers. An
ATM network is an electronic telecommunications systems connecting various banks, their ATMs, and data processing
companies, which allows an account holder of one bank to accomplish transactions at ATMs not owned by that bank.






Most ATM networks are ``regional,'' operating in areas encompassing a state or several contiguous states. ATMs and
ATM cards within the regional ATM network display a mark or brand identifying the network, so that depositors can identify
the ATMs from which they may access their accounts. National ATM networks exist, but these are by design networks of
last resort, used only where the two banks involved in a transaction do not both belong to any one regional ATM network.
National ATM network transactions are typically more expensive, and those networks provide only a subset of the transactions
available through regional ATM networks.

An ATM network allows banks to provide their depositors with ubiquitous, 24-hour access to their accounts. A bank
that becomes a member of a regional ATM network can offer its depositors access to their accounts not just at the bank's
own ATMs, but also at other banks' ATMs. Bankers believe that the ability to offer depositors the convenience of access
to their accounts at other banks' ATMs is necessary to attract and retain deposits. A bank_especially a small bank,
thrift or credit union with one or only a few offices, and that deploys few, if any, ATMs_would be at a significant competitive
disadvantage without the ability to offer its depositors access to many conveniently located ATMs. No other service
is a close substitute for regional ATM network access, and regional ATM network access constitutes a product market
within the meaning of the antitrust laws.

2. 

ATM processing. 

``ATM processing'' consists of the data processing services and telecommunications facilities and services used
to operate, monitor and support the operation of ATMs deployed by a bank. ATM processing also involves the connection
of the ATMs deployed by a bank to that bank's deposit records, for authorization and confirmation of that bank's depositors'
transactions, and the connection of the ATMs deployed by a bank to one or more ATM networks for authorization and confirmation
of other banks' depositors' transactions. Finally, ATM processing connects ATMs to an ATM network or to several ATM
networks.

A bank can purchase this ATM processing service from a regional ATM network or from an independent data processing
company (``third party processor''), or can provide this processing service to itself (as an ``intercept processor'').
However, a bank must deploy a large number of ATMs before it becomes economical to provide ATM processing internally.
Accordingly, small banks, thrifts, and credit unions very rarely act as intercept processors.

3. 

Competitive effects of third party processors. 

Third party processors provide banks, especially smaller ones, with a competitive source for ATM processing. Equally
important, third party processors offer a channel for the entry of competing regional ATM networks. Third party processors
typically maintain connections to several regional ATM networks, and those networks therefore can reach all of the
banks connected to a third party processor. Accordingly, the cost of and barriers to entry of regional ATM networks
fall dramatically.

In addition, third party processors themselves are potential entrants. Because a third party processor could switch
transactions among its customer banks itself (a process known as ``subswitching'') rather than passing those transactions
to the network switch, it is a potential ``unbranded'' ATM network. To become a competitor to the existing branded
regional ATM networks, the third party processor need only put its brand on the ATMs and ATM cards of its customer banks
and begin switching transactions.



B. EPS and Its Actions



The complaint alleges that EPS has monopoly power in ATM network access in the affected states, and that EPS has illegally
tied the sale of access to its MAC regional ATM network to the sale of the ATM processing for many of EPS's bank customers.
The complaint also alleges that this illegal tying arrangement has worked to maintain EPS's monopoly power in the
market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. This section, discusses EPS's actions and their anticompetitive
effects in more detail.

1. 

Elimination of ATM processing competition.

 EPS requires its member banks to purchase ATM processing services from EPS or provide it themselves as intercept processors.
 The effect of this rule is that small banks, thrifts, and credit unions_banks that cannot economically become intercept
processors_are forced to purchase ATM processing from EPS. This rule has foreclosed third party processors from
competing for banks' ATM processing business within the MAC regional ATM network.





EPS's exclusion of third party processor competition from the MAC network has allowed EPS to exact very high profits
from small banks, thrifts and credit unions. EPS has done so via two sorts of fees. 

First

, and most directly, EPS charges much more per ATM for ATM processing than third party processors typically charge.


Second

, EPS increases its own switching volume and revenues by prohibiting third party processing. Where EPS drives a bank's
ATMs, every transaction at those ATMs passes through the MAC switch and is charged to the bank as a switched transaction,
including those transactions by the bank's own depositors (its ``on-us'' transactions). In contrast, intercept
processors and banks that use third party processors do not send on-us transactions to a network switch. If banks could
use third party processors, MAC would not process, or collect switch fees, for those on-us transactions. Without
third party processors, EPS's switch volume and switch fee revenues are commensurately higher.

EPS's switch fees hit hardest those MAC banks with the fewest ATM processing options. EPS banks large enough to be intercept
processors escape the EPS charge for ``on-us'' transactions, and only pay MAC switch fees when their depositors use
other banks' ATMs. The smaller banks that cannot afford to be intercept processors pay switch fees for a much higher
proportion of their depositors' transactions. EPS takes advantage of this by imposing on its membership the steepest
switch fee schedule in the industry.
 The result is that the small banks that are forced_by EPS's third party processing restriction_to send all their ATM
transactions to the MAC switch must also pay very high fees for the switching of those transactions.





2. 

Deterrence of entry by competitor regional ATM networks.

 The complaint alleges that a further anticompetitive effect of the illegal tying arrangement is to maintain EPS's
market power in the market for regional ATM network access in the affected states. EPS's third party processor prohibition
has insulated the MAC regional ATM network from the competitive influences of third party processors. This subsection
gives a history of the MAC network's largely successful efforts to keep competitors out of its core areas, and explains
how EPS's current practice of excluding third party processors from the MAC network deters entry today.

a. 

A History of anticompetitive practices.

 For most of its existence and until 1992, the MAC network explicitly prohibited its bank customers from belonging
to other regional ATM networks. MAC combined this practice with a number of strategic purchases of adjacent regional
ATM networks. These acquisitions, the prohibition on multiple regional ATM network affiliation, and the third party
processor prohibition together proved to be a formidable force for keeping the affected states free from competition.

b. 

Effect of the third party processor prohibition.

 EPS's third party processing prohibition forces small banks that cannot economically provide their own ATM processing
to purchase the service from EPS. Because EPS effectively controls the communications links of their ATMs, these
banks cannot connect their ATMs to other regional ATM networks without the assistance_and approval_of EPS. EPS therefore
exercises an effective veto over these banks' access to other networks in the affected states, and conversely, other
networks' access to these banks. Third party processors, on the other hand, often offer access to several regional
ATM networks. If these banks were able to utilize third party processors, other regional networks would be much more
likely to seek and obtain their business. EPS's control over access to other regional ATM networks prevents these
networks from entering the affected states.






EPS's exclusion of third party processors also prevents the establishment of new networks. As discussed above, if
third party processing were allowed in the affected states, a third party processor could almost instantly form a
new network simply by placing a new ``brand'' on the ATMs and cards of its customer banks. The third party processor
would then switch these banks' transactions itself. The MAC network would switch transactions in only two cases:
(1) When a depositor of a bank connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank not connected to the third
party processor; or (2) when a depositor of a bank not connected to the third party processor used an ATM owned by a bank
connected to the third party processor.

While EPS excludes third party processors from the MAC network, would-be entrant regional ATM networks are substantially
unable to enter. The small banks that wish to join another network (which might offer ATM network access at lower prices)
will not be able to do so unless the other network has enough of a presence to provide small banks' depositors with sufficient
ubiquity and convenience. The entrant network, of course, cannot achieve the critical mass necessary to attract
banks. Accordingly, EPS's third party processing restriction creates what economists call a ``collective action
problem,'' and EPS's monopoly persists.



C. The Alleged Violations



1. 

First claim for relief_tying.

 The actions and policies of EPS described above constitute a tying arrangement that is per se unlawful under Section
1 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful tying arrangement is one in which two separate products are sold together, the seller
forces buyers to purchase these products together, the seller has market power in the tying product, and the tying
arrangement prevents what would otherwise be a substantial amount of commerce in the tied product. 

Eastman Kodak Co.

 v.

 Image Technical Services, Inc.,

 112 S.Ct. 2072 (1992); 

Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2

 v.

 Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984).

The two products in this case are regional ATM network access and ATM processing, which outside of MAC can be, and often
are, purchased separately. As described above, however, EPS's practices force banks wishing to obtain membership
in MAC, and thereby access to its regional ATM network, to also purchase ATM processing from MAC. Because MAC is the
only ubiquitous regional ATM network in the affected states and banks will not forego access to such a network, EPS
has market power in this tying product. Evidence gathered in the investigation indicates that there is substantial
commerce in the tied product.

<TEXT>
 

2. Second claim for relief-monopolization.

 EPS's actions and practices also constitute monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. An unlawful
monopoly involves both the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and the willful acquisition or maintenance
of that power. Willful acquisition or maintenance of a monopoly is shown by conduct that excludes rivals on some basis
other than efficiency, superior skill, foresight or industry. 

Aspen Skiing Co.

 v. 

Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp.

, 472 U.S. 585 (1985); 

United States

 v. 

Grinnell Corp.

, 384 U.S. 563 (1966).

As described above, EPS's MAC network is the only ubiquitous regional ATM network available to banks in the affected
states, and banks cannot forego access to such a network. EPS's prohibition of third party processing and other practices
prevents many banks from using competing regional ATM networks, and results in the exclusion of those networks. EPS's
conduct therefore constitutes unlawful monopolization.



III



Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgments



The proposed Final Judgment will end unlawful practices that substantially reduce competition in the markets for
regional ATM network access and ATM processing. The injunctions of the proposed Final Judgment do so by removing substantial
barriers to the entry of competition in the affected states. Removal of these barriers is the most effective means
of providing current and future MAC member banks with additional options for the purchase of these services.

These practices are enjoined, and these barriers are removed, by the injunctions of Section IV of the proposed Final
Judgment, which require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors by MAC members, to ensure
that qualified third party processors can obtain access to the MAC network, and to enable MAC members to join other
regional ATM networks.

Paragraphs A through D of Section IV require EPS to terminate its restrictions on the use of third party processors
by MAC members. EPS is enjoined from requiring its members to purchase ATM processing from MAC, from forbidding the
use of third party processors, from conditioning the price or other terms of MAC membership on the use or non-use of
third party processors, and from restricting the ability of MAC members to obtain third party processing. EPA is also
enjoined from charging any additional fees to MAC members for the use of third party processors.






Paragrahs E and F of Section IV ensure that qualified third party processors will be able to access the MAC network in
order to forward network transactions of their MAC member customers. To ensure that qualified third party processors
will obtain adequate communications links to MAC, the links provided to third party processors must be provided on
the same terms as the links MAC provides to its intercept processor customers.
 So that qualified third party processors can operate in the most efficient manner, EPS must, to the extent feasible,
permit transactions from multiple banks to pass over a single communications link rather than requiring a separate
link for each bank. Except under specified circumstances where immediate termination would be appropriate, EPS
may not terminate a third party processor without providing 30 days notice, and it must provide a copy of the notice
to the United States. This will give the United States an opportunity to examine the competitive consequences of any
such termination.





To allow EPS to ensure the quality of the MAC network, the proposed Final Judgment requires EPS to provide MAC network
access only to qualified third party processors. As with the quality of communications links, the standards for qualification
of third party processors are tied to MAC's qualification standards for intercept processors. A third party processor
is qualified if it meets MAC's technical, financial and operating criteria for intercept processors and third party
processors providing services to only one bank, and whatever additional technical criteria concerning the format
and content of transmissions are appropriate for third party processors processing for multiple banks. These criteria
may not discriminate between intercept and third party processors, nor may EPS charge additional fees to third party
processors for certification.






Paragraph G of Section IV prevents EPS from discriminating in the price of ATM network access against MAC members that
choose to utilize third party processors. The volume discounts available to members using third party processors
must be the same as the volume discounts available to intercept processors. Also, EPS must use a single price schedule
for banks in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, the areas in which the MAC network has historically had the greatest
monopoly power, and in which two of its principal owners (CoreStates and PNC) are located. By drawing this larger area,
EPS may not favor its own stockholders in Pennsylvania without giving similar volume discounts to large banks in New
Jersey and Delaware. EPS may use different price schedules in other states.

The preceding injunctions will remove the restrictions EPS has imposed on MAC member banks in their choice of ATM processors,
and thereby break the unlawful tie EPS has established between purchase of MAC ATM network services and purchase of
ATM processing. The direct consequence will be to make the purchase of third party processing a realistic option for
MAC members. This should bring about the entry of competitors to MAC for ATM processing. As discussed in Section II.A.3
of this Competitive Impact Statement, third party processors often have links to many regional ATM networks, and
so use of a third party processor by a bank can facilitate its joining of multiple ATM networks. Therefore, an indirect
consequence of breaking the unlawful tie between MAC ATM network services and processing services will likely be
an increase in competition in the markets for regional ATM network access in the affected states.

<PARENT> FR940512-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To ensure that competition for ATM network services is in fact enhanced, Paragraph H of Section IV of the proposed Final
Judgment enjoins EPS from restricting the ability of MAC members to access other networks through their own facilities
or those of third party processors. While MAC itself is not required to establish gateways to competing networks,
it may not hinder its members form joining other networks. EPS also may not condition the price or terms of MAC membership
upon not joining another network. EPS must permit MAC members to display multiple network marks on ATMs and ATM cards,
except for electronic stored value cards.
 The injunction against prohibiting multiple branding of ATMs applies in all areas where MAC operates; the injunction
against prohibiting multiple branding of ATM cards applies only in the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware,
Ohio and Indiana, areas in which MAC historically had monopoly power, or in which there is a dangerous probability
that MAC might soon gain monopoly power.







Portions of the proposed Final Judgment, including the section lifting EPS restrictions on the participation of
MAC members in competing ATM networks, will take effect immediately upon entry. Paragraphs A through E of Section
IV, which lift EPS restrictions concerning the use of third party processors, will take effect in two stages. On October
1, 1994, EPS must begin the certification process for third party processors in the MAC Midwest Platform. It must allow
third party processors to complete certification in a reasonably prompt manner, after which these processors will
be able to act as third party processors for banks in MAC's midwest region. On January 1, 1995, EPS must allow certified
third party processors to act as third party processors for all banks in the MAC network, and it must begin the process
of certifying third party processors in any remaining region. The delay between entry of the proposed Final Judgment
and the effective dates of the injunctions provides EPS sufficient time to undertake the technical steps necessary
to ensure that all regions of the MAC network will be able to accommodate third party processors.

These provisions take effect immediately in any area where banks were permitted to use third party processors as of
January 1, 1993. This prevents EPS from banning third party processing in recently acquired or soon to be acquired
networks where third party processing has not been restricted. Also, EPS may not discontinue existing arrangements
whereby MAC members use third party processors.

The United States and EPS have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court at any time after
compliance with the APPA. The proposed Final Judgment constitutes no admission by either party as to any issue of fact
or law. Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the APPA, entry of the proposed Final Judgment is conditioned upon a
determination by the Court that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.



IV



Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants



Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as
well as costs and reasonable attorneys fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the
bringing of any private antitrust action under the Clayton Act. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has no 

prima facie

 effect in any private lawsuit that may be brought against the defendant.

V



Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment



The APPA provides a period of at least sixty (60) days preceding the effective date of the proposed Final Judgments
within which any person may submit to the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment. Any
person who wishes to comment should do so within sixty (60) days of the date of publication of this Competitive Impact
Statement in the 

Federal Register

. The United States will evaluate the comments, determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to the
comments. The comments and response(s) of the United States will be filed with the Court and published in the 

Federal Register

.

Written comments should be submitted to Richard Liebeskind, Assistant Chief, Communications and Finance Section,
Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001.

The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and any party may apply
to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for its modification, interpretation or enforcement.



VI



Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment



As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation seeking structural relief,
including division of the MAC network. The United States rejected that alternative because the termination of MAC's
restrictive practices concerning use of third party processors and membership in multiple regional ATM networks
will effectively break the unlawful tie established by EPS between ATM network access and ATM processing. Breaking
this tie will encourage the entry of competitors in the affected states in the markets for ATM network services and
ATM processing more efficiently than division of the MAC network. In addition, division of the MAC network was likely
to involve the Court and the parties in a complex and time-consuming process of reorganizing the network, delaying
the desired improvement in competition.

The United States also recognized that such litigation would require determination of several disputed issues of
law and fact, and that there could be no assurance that the position of the United States would prevail.



VII



Standard of Review Under the Tunney Act for Proposed Final Judgment



The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a
sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is
in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court 

may

 consider_




(1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement
and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered,
and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;

(2) The impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination
of the issues at trial.




15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning
from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' 

NAACP

 v. 

Federal Power Comm'n,

 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition
as the rule of trade,'' 

Northern Pacific Railway Co.

 v. 

United States

, 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final
judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. 

United States

 v. 

American Cyanamid Co.,

 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), 

cert. denied,

 465 U.S. 1101 (1984); 

United States

 v. 

Waste Management, Inc.,

 1985-2 Trade Cas.  66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere
compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits
of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.''
 Rather,




absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest
finding, should * * * carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact
statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the
circumstances.






United States

 v. 

Mid-America Dairymen, Inc.,

 1977-1 Trade Cas.  61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977).



It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve
the public.'' 

United States

 v. 

BNS, Inc.,

 858 F.2d 456, 462 (9th Cir. 1988) 

quoting United States

 v. 

Bechtel Corp.,

 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), 

cert. denied,

 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that




the balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must be
left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public interest
is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree. The court
is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether the settlement
is ``

within the reaches of the public interest.

'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.







A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they




waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.






United States

 v. 

Armour & Co.,

 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971).



The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every anticompetitive effect of a particular practice or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required
for a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would
impose on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'
(citations omitted).''

<DOCTITLE>U.S. v. Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation; Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact
Statement </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. section 16 (b) through (h),
that a proposed Final Judgment, a Stipulation and a Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia in 

United States of America

 v. 

Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation,

 Civil No. 94-0948.

The Complaint in the case alleges that the effect of the proposed merger between the two defendants, Tele-Communications,
Inc. and Liberty Media Corporation, may be substantially to lessen competition among multichannel subscription
television providers and video programming providers.

The proposed Final Judgment enjoins the defendants from (A) discriminating against unaffiliated video programming
offered by such providers, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition; and
(B) discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel subscription television providers in the sale or license
of video programming, where the effect of such discrimination is unreasonably to restrain competition. These injunctions
apply with respect to the conduct of organizations under the defendants' control. With interest not amounting to
control, the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from seeking or supporting conduct that would violate (A)
or (B) above is engaged in directly by defendants.

Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments
and responses thereto will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section,
Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 4th Street NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: 202/514-5621).

Competitive Impact Statement



Pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA or ``Tunney Act''), 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h),
the United States submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for
entry with the consent of Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media Corp. in this civil antitrust proceeding.



I



Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding



On April 26, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint, under section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, against Tele-Communications, Inc. (``TCI''), and Liberty Media Corporation (``Liberty'') (collectively
``Defendants''), alleging that the proposed merger of Defendants violates section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 18.

TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States in terms of subscribers, and Liberty
is one of the largest MSOs. Pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994, TCI and Liberty agreed to merge. Combined,
TCI and Liberty would have financial interests in cable systems accounting for more than 13 million subscribers,
or approximately one-fourth of the nation's cable subscribers. The combined firms would also have substantial financial
interests in a large number of providers of video programming to multichannel subscription television distributors.
The Complaint alleges that the effect of such combination may be substantially to lessen competition in violation
of section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, by:




1. Decreasing actual and potential competition among video programming providers, because the combined TCI-Liberty
may have the increased ability and incentive to discriminate with respect to access to its cable systems, or the terms
and conditions of such access, in favor of its affiliated video programming providers and against unaffiliated video
programming providers.

2. Decreasing actual and potential competition among multichannel subscription television distributors, because
the combined TCI-Liberty may have the increased ability and incentive to deny to competing multichannel subscription
television distributors access to its affiliated video programming services, or to provide such access only on unreasonable
terms.




On April 26, 1994, the United States and Defendants filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed
Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger. The proposed Final Judgment,
as explained more fully below, would enjoin Defendants from discriminating against unaffiliated video programmers
with respect to access to its cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors (``MSTDs''),
and from discriminating against other MSTDs with respect to its programming providers, where such discrimination
results in an unreasonable restraint on competition.

The United States and Defendants have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance
with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction
to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment, and to punish violations of the Final Judgment.



II



Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation



A. 

Description of the parties and the proposed transaction. 

TCI is the largest cable multiple systems operator (``MSO'') in the United States, with financial and management
interests in cable systems serving more than 10.2 million subscribers. TCI also has substantial interests in direct-to-home
satellite delivery of multichannel subscription television service, with both a substantial C-band satellite
business and a partnership interest in Primestar Partners, L.P., a Ku-band satellite multichannel subscription
television service. TCI also has financial and management interests in programming services such as The Discovery
Channel, The Learning Channel, E! Entertainment Television, Request Television (pay-per-view), Home Shopping
Network Inc., QVC Network Inc., Starz, Rocky Mountain Prime Sports Network, and Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc.
(which provides Cable News Network (CNN), Headline News, The Cartoon Network, TBS and Turner Network Television
(TNT)).

Liberty is a large cable MSO, with financial and management interests in cable systems serving 2.9 million subscribers.
Liberty also has financial and management interests in a wide range of programming services, including Black Entertainment
Television (BET), The Box, Courtroom Television Network, Encore, Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network
Inc., QVC Network Inc., Prime Sports Network and more than a dozen regional sports channels.

TCI and Liberty intend to merge pursuant to an agreement dated January 27, 1994. Together TCI and Liberty will serve
more than 13 million subscribers, or about a quarter of the nation's cable subscribers, and have financial interests
in a wide range of programming services, including a number of the most popular and widely-carried services.

B. 

Historical relationship between TCI and Liberty.

 In 1990, TCI created Liberty, a new public company, through a rights offering to TCI shareholders and moved certain
TCI assets into Liberty. According to TCI, the new company was created for two reasons. First, the company anticipated
that possible federal legislation or regulation might force such divestiture later under unfavorable circumstances;
a voluntary separation allowed TCI to retain ties to the new company. Second, in a smaller company, management would
be able to devote greater attention to maximizing the value of Liberty assets and have greater freedom to pursue growth
opportunities in the cable industry. TCI management also felt that capital and financial markets had not given appropriate
recognition to certain TCI interests and assets, particularly in the cable programming area, because they were difficult
for security analysts and others to identify, value and track; TCI hoped that, in a smaller company, the actual and
potential value of those interests and assets would be appropriately recognized.

Although Liberty was organized as a separate company, it shared stockholders and directors with TCI. Five shareholders
maintained voting control of both firms, and Bob Magness has simultaneously served as Chairman of the Board of TCI
and a director of Liberty, and John Malone has simultaneously served as President, Chief Executive Officer, and a
director of TCI and Chairman of the Board of Liberty. TCI acknowledges that the two companies have cooperated closely
since Liberty was formed, and are partners in a number of ventures.

In 1992, Congress passed the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act, Public Law No. 102-385,
106 Stat. 106 (1992) (``1992 Cable Act''), which, combined with implementing FCC regulation, established a legal
framework regarding, among other things, the number of cable subscribers a person is authorized to reach through
cable systems owned by such person, or in which such person has an attributable interest, and delineating the extent
to which multichannel video programming distributors may engage in the creation or production of video programming.
TCI claims that the cable system and programming assets of TCI and Liberty can be recombined under this regulatory
framework, and that appropriate market valuation for Liberty's assets has been achieved, thus obviating the principal
reasons for separating the companies. According to TCI the recombination will eliminate certain inefficiencies
and costs of separation, as well as eliminate confusion and conflicts that may have resulted from the separation.

While not indifferent to the cooperative relationship between the firms and the commonality of control in five shareholders
and common managers and directors, the Department has analyzed the proposed merger as a transaction involving two
separate entities, since separate legal and fiduciary obligations exist for each of the firms that require each firm
to operate in its distinct interest.

C. 

Effects on competition.

 A multichannel subscription television distributor (``MSTD'') is an entity that provides multiple channels of
video programming to consumers on a subscription or fee basis, as differentiated from local broadcast television
stations which individually provide a single channel at no charge within their broadcast areas. MSTDs deliver programming
to consumers utilizing various methods, including cable, multichannel multipoint distribution (``MMDS''), satellite
master antenna television (``SMATV''), direct-to-home satellite, or the facilities of common carrier telephone
companies or their affiliates.

The United States filed its complaint because the effects of the proposed merger may be substantially to lessen competition
(i) among providers of video programming to MSTDs in the United States, and (ii) among MSTDs in the areas in the United
States in which TCI and Liberty control cable system.
 The merger of TCI and Liberty would result in a vertically integrated firm with (1) substantial interests in widely
distributed and popular video programming and (2) control of approximately one-quarter of the nation's cable subscribers.
Accordingly, the merged firm may have both the ability and incentive to lessen competition by discriminating against
non-affiliated programmers in terms of access to its MSTDs and by denying to competing MSTDs access to its video programming
on reasonable terms.





The market for multichannel subscription television distribution today is overwhelmingly dominated by local cable
systems. Cable television service is available in nearly all urban ad suburban areas in the United States as well as
many rural areas, passing more than 95% of the nation's estimated 92 million television households. Cable television
systems currently serve more than 55 million subscribers in more than 11,300 cable systems located in all 50 states,
or about 60% of households passed. Nearly all communities are served by a single cable system; fewer than 0.5% of the
more than 10,000 cable franchise areas have more than one cable system available to local cable subscribers. Today,
cable television systems face very limited competition from other types of distribution systems, including MMDS,
SMATV, and direct-to-home satellite, and may face competition in the future from video dialtone services.

MMDS delivers programming over microwave channels received by subscribers with special antennae. There are currently
fewer than 150 MMDS systems in operation, serving an estimated 600,000 subscribers. MMDS has recently obtained regulatory
approval to deploy systems that are considered technologically superior, which may increase its availability and
attractiveness as an alternative to cable television service.

<TEXT>
 

SMATV is essentially a private cable system, typically used in apartment buildings or other high-density housing.
SMATV is estimated to have fewer than 1 million subscribers.

Home satellite dishes are used to receive programming from communications satellites. More than two and one-half
million satellite dishes have been sold in the United States. C-band satellite service, which is provided by low-power
satellites, requires consumers to install satellite receiving dishes eight to twelve feet in diameter at an installed
cost of $1,500 or more. Because of its high installed cost and the size of the receiving dish required, C-band satellite
is a poor alternative to cable television service for most current or potential cable subscribers. Medium-power
Ku-band satellite service, provided by TCI and its partners in a joint venture called Primestar Partners, L.P., uses
dishes three feet in diameter and has approximately 70,000 subscribers. High-power DBS is expected to become operational
and available within a few months using a dish 18 inches in diameter, and may by virtue of its smaller dish size be more
attractive to consumers so that it ultimately may offer greater competition to cable service than the other satellite
services.

Video dialtone is a multichannel subscription television service recently authorized by Federal Communications
Commission regulation and being developed by common carrier telephone companies. Using the telephone network,
telephone companies plan to offer distribution of programming provided by third parties. As the telephone companies
improve the capabilities and capacity of their networks, they are expected to be able to offer greatly expanded channel
capacity and services such as ``video-on-demand.'' At present, there are a small number of pilot projects demonstrating
the service. Widespread development of video dialtone services in the future may present a substantial competitor
to cable systems. Common carrier telephone companies also have announced their interest in providing cable service
directly to subscribers in the event that legal restrictions on their offering such services within their operating
regions are removed.

As discussed above, both TCI and Liberty, in addition to operating cable systems, each have substantial financial
interests in video programming services provided to cable systems and other MSTDs. The merger of TCI and Liberty creates
a vertically integrated firm with substantial power both as a MSTD and as a video programming provider. TCI and Liberty
together will effectively control access to about one-fourth of cable subscribers and will be affiliated with eight
of the twenty most widely distributed cable programming services. This substantial integration is likely to increase
abilities and incentives to restrain competition in two ways. First, the merged firm could discriminate against
competitive video programmers in favor of its affiliated programmers by refusing to carry programs or by denying
similar terms or conditions thereby making it significantly more difficult for such competitive programmers to
operate profitably or to compete effectively against the merged firm's programming services. Second, the merged
firm could deny access to or discriminate in terms of access to its programming to competing MSTDs, making it more difficult
for competitive distribution systems to obtain programming necessary to compete effectively against the merged
firm's MSTDs.



III



Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment



The United States and the defendants have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance
with the APPA. The stipulation provides that entry of the Final Judgment does not constitute any evidence or admission
by any party with respect to any issue of fact or law. Under the provisions of the APPA, the proposed Final Judgment may
not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. The Department believes that the proposed
Final Judgment provides an adequate remedy for the alleged violation and is in the public interest. The term of the
proposed Final Judgment is five (5) years. The length of this term reflects the Department's recognition that this
industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992
Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations.

Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins Defendants' cable systems and other MSTDs from discriminating
against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions, where the effect of such conduct
is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision does not create an automatic right of access for any individual
video programmer to any of Defendants' individual MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between
Defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect
of discrimination by Defendants is to restrain competition, such conduct is prohibited. Discriminatory conduct
can take a variety of forms depending on individual circumstances, and may include, but is not limited to, discrimination
in: (i) Pricing; (ii) channel assignment; (iii) tiering or packaging of programming services; (iv) promotional
activities; and (v) signal quality.


By section IV(B), Defendants are enjoined from refusing to sell or license, or from selling or licensing only on a discriminatory
basis, video programming in which they have an interest to any competing MSTD, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably
to restrain competition. Differences in price or terms that are reasonably based on ordinary commercial factors,
including but not limited to the factors currently set forth in 47 CFR 76.1002(b), will not constitute prohibited
discrimination. This section therefore does not prevent defendants from engaging in good faith business negotiations
or from imposing reasonable requirements for the creditworthiness or service quality of a distributor, or from establishing
prices, terms, and conditions that reasonably reflect actual differences in the distributor's costs of providing
such video programming or economies of scale or other economic benefits reasonably attributable to the number of
subscribers served by such distributor. This provision does assure that Defendants may not refuse to license their
video programming to competing MSTDs where the effect would be to inhibit the ability of such MSTDs to compete against
Defendants.

Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in sections IV (A) and (B) to prevent Defendants from seeking or supporting,
with respect to any MSTD or video programming provider in which Defendants have any financial interest but do not control,
conduct that would violate sections IV (A) or (B) if engaged in by Defendants. For example, should Defendants urge
Turner Broadcasting, Inc. to deny programming to a competing MSTD under circumstances that would result in an unreasonable
restraint on competition, such conduct by Defendants would violate this section.

By prohibiting conduct by Defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming or multichannel
subscription television distribution, the Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed
merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully remedied. In addition, by expressly including common carrier telephone
companies and their video dialtone customers in the definition of MSTDs, the proposed Final Judgment will make clear
the defendants' obligation to refrain from anticompetitive discrimination against these potential competitors.
The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of sections 12 and 19 of the 1992
Cable Act, and their implementing FCC regulations, as well as the judgments recently entered in 

U.S. 

v. 

Primestar Partners, L.P., et al.


 and 

State of New York, et al. 

v. 

Primestar Partners, L.P., et al.


 (``Primestar cases'').

IV 

Remedies Available to Potential Litigants 



Section 4 of the Clayton Act, U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages the person has suffered, as
well as costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist
the bringing of any private antitrust actions under the Clayton Act. Under the provisions of section 5(a) of the Clayton
act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has no 

prima facie 

effect in any private lawsuit that may be brought against the defendants. 



V



Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment



As provided by the APPA, any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment should be modified may submit written
comments within the sixty (60) day period from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice,
555 Fourth Street, NW., room 8104, Washington, DC 20001. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be
filed with the Court and published in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
at any time prior to entry. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over these actions,
and any party may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for their modification, interpretation
or enforcement. 


VI



Alternatives To the Proposed Final Judgment 



The United States considered, as an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, litigation to enjoin the merger.
The United States rejected that alternative because the relief in the proposed Final Judgment should prevent the
possible occurrence of conduct the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition in the provision of
video programming to MSTDs in the United States or competition among MSTDs in the geographic areas in which Defendants
have cable systems. Moreover, the terms of the proposed Final Judgment are supplemented by the provisions of the 1992
Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations, as well as the judgments in the Primestar cases. Under these circumstances,
seeking to enjoin the merger would only prevent the two firms from achieving the economic efficiencies that may result
from vertical integration and, given their history and present circumstances, eliminating the cost imposed by their
legal separation into separate firms. 



VII


Determinative Documents 



No documents were determinative in the formulation of the proposed Final Judgment. Consequently, the United States
has not attached any such document to the proposed Final Judgment.

1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift
examination) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36-06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner
proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the pre-shift examination after an
air quantity reading is taken inby the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air
split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner proposes to physically
examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would
provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


6. K & L Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-48-C] 


K & L Coal Company, RD 

#

1, Box 266, Shamokin, Pennsylvania 17872 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4)
and (5) (weekly examination) to its No. 1 Slope (I.D. No. 36-06649) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania.
Due to hazardous conditions, daily or weekly traveling of the intake air course significantly increases the fall
potential. The petitioner proposes to examine the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway from the gunboat/slope
car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine

located in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the air course along the West
Side of the Main North entries that flow south from 1 North (adjacent to 3 North Crossover Seals) to the junction with
the 1 West entries, the entire area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish check points to
monitor the quantity of air; and to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air on a weekly basis
and record the results in a record book kept on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard. 


10. Consolidation Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-52-C] 


Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (2), (4) and (c)(3) (weekly examination) to its Ireland Mine (I.D. No.
46-01438) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the 4 South
seals and certain air courses from the 4 South seals to the No. 2 Fan, the area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner
proposes to change the location of air measuring stations ``C'' and ``D'' and to continue evaluating daily air measuring
stations ``A'' and ``B'' that were established in Decision and Order dated July 17, 1989, Docket No. M-88-252-C;
to post a sign in the adjacent travel entry designating the location of these measuring stations in the adjacent travel
entry; to establish an air measuring station ``F'' on the surface at Ireland Mine No. 2 Fan in lieu of air measuring stations
``C'' and ``D''; and to have a certified person monitor each air measuring station daily and record the results in a
book that would be provided at each air measuring station and on the surface and made available to all interested persons.
The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as
would the mandatory standard. 


11. Kerr-McGee Coal Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-53-C] 


Kerr-McGee Coal Corporation, P.O. Box 727, Harrisburg, Illinois 62946 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.503 (permissible electric face equipment; maintenance) to its Galatia Mine (I.D. No. 11-02752)
located in Saline County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes to use electric motor-driven mine equipment in a longwall
recovery room. This equipment would serve as a power center (transformer) in intake air to furnish power to roofbolters
with a 1200 foot long, Number 2, G-GC, 2KV trail cable, protected for a short circuit fault with an instantaneous
circuit breaker set at not more than 600 amperes at all points of the recovery room. The petitioner asserts that the
proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



12. Buck Mountain Coal Company No. 2 


[Docket No. M-94-54-C] 


Buck Mountain Coal Company No. 2, R.D. 

#

2, Box 425-B2, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.332
(b)(1) and (b)(2) (working sections and working places) to its Buck Mountain Slope (I.D. No. 36-02053) located
in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use air passing through inaccessible abandoned
workings and additional areas by mixing with the air in the intake haulage slope to ventilate the only active working
section, to ensure air quality by sampling intake air during pre-shift and on-shift examinations, and to suspend
mine production when air quality fails to meet specified criteria. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate
method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


13. Eighty-Four Mining Company 


[Docket No. M-94-55-C] 


Eighty-Four Mining Company, P.O. Box 729, Indiana, Pennsylvania 15701 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.1101-8(a) (water sprinkler systems; arrangement of sprinklers) to its Mine 84 (I.D. No. 36-00958)
located in Washington County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to install a thermostat device on the electrical
control side of the belt so that when it is activated it would de-energize the belt control side of the Combination Box
and trigger an audible and visual alarm to miner's working in the immediate area; to have a qualified person examine,
test, and properly maintain on a weekly basis each Combination Box to assure safe operating conditions; and to record
the results of each examination in a book. The petitioner states that application of the standard would result in a
diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would
provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 


14. Soldier Creek Coal Company 


[Docket No. M-94-56-C] 


Soldier Creek Coal Company, P.O. Box 1029, Wellington, Utah 84542 has filed a petition to modify the application of
30 CFR 75.380(d)(4) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Soldier Canyon Mine (I.D. No. 42-00077)
located in Carbon County, Utah. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to allow the 4 foot wide stairway
at overcasts installed prior to November 16, 1992 to be used as an underground escapeway instead of using a 6 foot wide
escapeway. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard. 


15. Cyprus Sierrita Corporation 


[Docket No. M-94-01-M] 


Cyprus Sierrita Corporation, 9100 E. Mineral Circle, Englewood, California 80112 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 56.6309 (fuel oil requirements for ANFO) to its Sierrita Mine (I.D. No. 02-00144) located
in Pima County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes to blend recycled oil with fuel oil to create a blasting agent. The
petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would

Beaumont Area Pipefitters Joint Apprenticeship Committee (the Plan) Located in Beaumont, Texas; Proposed Exemption




[Application No. L-9412]




The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 406(b) (1) and (2) of the Act shall not apply to the purchase of certain
real property (the Property) by the Plan from Pipefitters Local 195 of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (the Union), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the
following conditions are met: 

1. An independent fiduciary determines that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the Plan; 
2. The fair market value of the Property is established by an appraiser unrelated to the Plan or the Union; 
3. The Plan pays no more than the lesser of $462,800 or the fair market value of the Property as determined at the time
of purchase; 
4. The purchase is a one-time transaction for cash; and 
5. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is an apprenticeship training plan established and administered pursuant to the provisions of section
302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. As of January 31, 1994, the Plan had 580 participants and total assets
of $1,248,499. On the same date, the number of employers contributing to the Plan totaled 21. 
2. The Property consists of 2.74 acres of land and improvements located adjacent to property of the Union. The improvements
include three one and two-story buildings, constructed by the Union in 1968 and 1978, designed for use as classroom
and apprenticeship training facilities for the Plan and its participants. From 1968 to 1988 the Plan operated an apprenticeship
program on the Property pursuant to a lease of the Property by the Union to the Plan.

1

 In August 1988 the Union sold the Property to the Plan. The Plan partially financed this purchase by obtaining a loan
from the Sabine Area Pipefitters Local 195 Pension Trust Fund (Local 195 Pension Plan). The Local 195 Pension Plan,
which was later merged into the Plumbers and Pipefitters National Pension Fund, had interlocking trustees with the
Plan and the Plan made some contributions to the Local 195 Pension Plan on behalf of its participants. The loan was repaid
in June 1991. 





In September 1990 the Department commenced an investigation of the Plan regarding the sale of the Property by the Union
to the Plan and the loan between the Plan and the Local 195 Pension Plan.

2

 Also, an application for exemption for retroactive relief from the prohibited transaction provisions of the Act
was submitted to the Department for these transactions. In a letter in January 1992, the Department cited as reasons
for denying the exemption application, among other factors, the lack of the review and prior approval of the transactions
by an independent fiduciary. Following this exemption denial, an agreement was reached with the Department which
required that the Property be sold back by the Plan to the Union. Such sale occurred in December 1992. Since that date,
the Plan has utilized the Property as a training facility without charge from the Union. However, the applicant represents
that because of an economic downturn in the area, the Union considers it a hardship to continue this arrangement.

3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property on January 14, 1994, from Donnie M. Jones, MAI (Jones), a real
estate appraiser located in Port Arthur, Texas. Jones represents that he is not related in any way to the Plan or the
Union. Utilizing the income, cost and sales comparison approaches to value, Jones estimated that the Property had
a fair market value of $462,800 as of the date of the appraisal. By letter dated March 1, 1994, Jones stated that he was
aware, in preparing the appraisal, that the Plan was the prospective buyer of the Property and that this knowledge
had no influence on his calculation of value. 

4. The Plan now proposes to purchase the Property from the Union so that the Plan itself will own the training and educational
facilities used to train journeymen and apprentices. Plan fiduciaries note that ownership of the Property will give
the Plan full control of the buildings, grounds and parking lots and will enable the Plan to make improvements to the
Property as needed. The Plan will pay no more than current fair market value for the Property, as established by an updated
independent appraisal. The purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions
in regard to the purchase. The applicant represents that, after the purchase of the Property, the Plan will have more
than enough funds for operational purposes of the training program. 

5. The Plan and the Union have selected Joseph P. Connors, Sr. (Connors), an attorney with the firm of Connors Associates,
Inc. in Washington, DC to serve as independent fiduciary in regard to the proposed transaction. The applicant represents
that Connors is independent of the Plan and the Union. Connors states that he has had extensive experience working
with Taft-Hartley plans, including serving as chairman of funds of the United Mine Workers. Connors further states
that he is well aware that while acting as independent fiduciary he assumes personal liability and he must act solely
in the interest of the Plan and its participants. 

Connors maintains that the proposed transaction is definitely in the best interests of the Plan. In this regard, Connors
has met with officers of the Union and trustees of the Plan and has made an inspection of the Property with Russell Allen,
the training director for the Plan. The Plan has operated an apprenticeship program utilizing the Property since
the initial time of construction in 1968. As independent fiduciary, Connors will make certain that the Plan pays no
more than fair market value for the Property and will enforce all rights of the Plan in regard to the proposed transaction.


6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The purchase of the Property will give the Plan ownership of the facilities it uses for
its apprenticeship training program; (2) an independent fiduciary has determined that the proposed transaction
is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants; (3) the Plan will pay no more than fair market value for the
Property, based on an updated independent appraisal; (4) the purchase will be a one-time transaction for cash; and
(5) the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction.

Hartford Life Insurance Company (Hartford Life) 
and Hartford Investment Management Company (HIMCO) Located in Hartford, Connecticut; Proposed Exemption 



[Application Nos. D-9458 and D-9459]

 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to sales and transfers of assets of employee benefit plans (the Plans) to Hartford Life
pursuant to the terms of a synthetic guaranteed investment contract (Synthetic GIC) entered into by the Plan with
Hartford Life and HIMCO, provided the following conditions have been met: (a) Prior to the execution of such Synthetic
GIC, an independent fiduciary of such Plan receives a full and detailed written disclosure of all material features
of the Synthetic GIC, including all applicable fees and charges; (b) following receipt of such disclosure, the Plan's
independent fiduciary approves in writing the execution of the Synthetic GIC on behalf of the Plan; (c) all fees and
charges imposed under such Synthetic GIC are reasonable; (d) each Synthetic GIC will specifically provide for an
objective means for determining the fair market value of the securities owned by the Plan pursuant to the Synthetic
GIC; (e) Hartford Life will maintain books and records of all transactions which will be subject to annual audit by
independent certified public accountants selected by and responsible solely to the Plan; and (f) the Synthetic GIC
will be offered only in principal amounts of $50 million or more. 




Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut. As of December
31, 1992, Hartford Life had assets of approximately $20.8 billion and insurance in force of approximately $93.5 billion.
Hartford Life is currently rated as follows: 
A.M. Best_A++; Standard & Poor's_AAA; Duff & Phelps_AAA; and Moody's_Aa2. Hartford Life is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Company, which is in turn a subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company.
Hartford Fire Insurance Company is owned by the ITT Corporation. A significant portion of Hartford Life's business
consists of writing insurance and annuity contracts, guaranteed investment contracts, and other types of funding
agreements for numerous pension plans, most of which are subject to title I of the Act. 

2. HIMCO, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life, is an investment management company registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As of 
March 31, 1993, HIMCO had $3.06 billion in assets under management. HIMCO manages assets in various Hartford Life
separate accounts and other portfolios. 

3. For many years, Hartford Life has offered various guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) for sale in the qualified
plan market. A GIC is a type of contract under which an insurance company, in exchange for a sum of money, guarantees
that it will return that sum to the contractholder on a specified maturity date, with interest at the specified rate.
In anticipation of its obligation, the insurance company invests the funds received from the contractholder primarily
in fixed-income instruments, in order to achieve a return that will enable the company to meet its guarantee at maturity.
Typically, these fixed-income investments are held in the company's general asset account, although under some
type of GIC products, the investments are held in a separate account. 

4. Recently, many pension fund investment managers have expressed interest in achieving an even higher degree of
security for plan investments than that afforded by conventional GICs. In response, some insurance companies have
begun to offer Synthetic GICs. Under some Synthetic GICs, instead of paying a premium to the insurance company on the
effective date of the contract, the plan places assets in a custodial bank account owned by the plan. The assets are
held in that account by the bank custodian and are managed exclusively by the insurance company or an affiliate until
the contract's maturity. If the market value of the assets in the custodial account at maturity is less than the amount
initially placed in the account plus guaranteed interest, the insurer must make the plan whole for the difference.
The assets in the account are never owned by the insurance company, however, and the plan's investment is therefore
not affected by risks to which the insurer's own assets may be subject. 

5. Hartford Life now intends to offer a Synthetic GIC product to Plans. Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC will be offered
in principal amounts of $50 million or more. Thus, Hartford Life intends to offer its Synthetic GICs only to large Plans.


6. Essentially, the Synthetic GIC will consist of an investment management agreement under which HIMCO, acting in
a fiduciary capacity, will manage assets of a Plan placed in the custody of a bank (the Bank) selected by the Plan (with
the approval of Hartford Life). The Synthetic GICs offered by Hartford Life will differ from conventional management
agreements, however, in that Hartford Life will guarantee that the amounts placed in the bank custodial account for
management by HIMCO will be released to the Plan, with interest at a specified rate, on certain specified dates. The
Synthetic GIC will be benefit responsive in that it may be tailored to meet the Plan's predictable benefit obligations
by establishing Scheduled Account Distribution Dates (see rep. 10, below) at appropriate times. In addition, unscheduled
interim distributions, referred to as Benefit Sensitivity Advances (see rep. 22, below), will also be available
under certain circumstances. At all times, the Plan, not Hartford Life, will remain the legal owner of the account.


7. The decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a Plan by a Plan fiduciary who is independent of
Hartford Life and HIMCO. The applicants represent that due to the large size of the Plans involved, the independent
fiduciaries authorizing Plans to enter into the Synthetic GICs can be expected to be (or to retain) sophisticated
professional asset managers with specialized expertise in the area of GICs and similar investments. Prior to the
Plan's investment, Hartford Life will furnish the Plan's independent fiduciary full and detailed disclosure of
all features of the Synthetic GIC, including all applicable fees (see rep. 24, below) and charges (see reps. 16 and
23, below). There is no additional fee or charge for the guarantee. 

8. When a Plan enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life, an account (the Account) will be established for the Plan.

Contributions made by the Plan to the Account on the ``Account Commencement Date'' and on any subsequent dates specified
in the Synthetic GIC will be delivered to the Bank and credited to the Account. The assets in the Account will be held
in the Bank's custody and subject to management by HIMCO. Contributions placed into the Account will be invested immediately;
there will be no time lag between the time the contributions are put in the Account and the time they are invested.

<TEXT>
 

9. The Synthetic GICs will not be offered on a pooled basis; in other words, a separate custodial Account will be established
for each Plan that enters into a Synthetic GIC with Hartford Life and the assets in that Account will be managed separately
from any assets subject to a Synthetic GIC with another Plan. 
10. Hartford Life's guarantee as to principal and interest under a Synthetic GIC will come into play on certain specified
dates, namely, the ``Scheduled Account Termination Date'' and any ``Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s)''
provided for prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date. On those dates, as described in greater detail below
(see reps. 15 and 16, below), the Plan will be entitled to distributions from the Account of the ``Adjusted Book Value''
of contributions previously made to the Account. (Specific amounts will be distributed on the Scheduled Account
Distribution Date(s), if any, and the balance of the Account's Adjusted Book Value will be distributed on the Scheduled
Account Termination Date, at which time the Synthetic GIC will terminate.) Adjusted Book Value is defined as the net
asset balance of the Account derived from contributions plus interest at a specified ``Guaranteed Rate of Interest''
determined by mutual agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan, less prior withdrawals. (The Guaranteed Rate
of Interest that Hartford Life will be willing to offer under a particular Synthetic GIC will be based on yields on securities
of various durations currently available in the marketplace at the time the Synthetic GIC is executed.) In other words,
Hartford Life will guarantee that on the Scheduled Account Distribution Date(s) (if any) and on the Scheduled Account
Termination Date, distributions will be made to the Plan in amounts at least equal to contributions previously made
to the Account, plus interest at the Guaranteed Rate of Interest, with appropriate adjustments for withdrawals (i.e.,
Scheduled Account Distributions, and Benefit Sensitivity Advances as described in rep. 22, below). 

11. The applicants represent that the Guaranteed Rate of Interest for a particular Synthetic GIC will be established
by arm's-length negotiation between the Plan and Hartford Life in advance of entering into the contract, and will
be set forth in writing in the Synthetic GIC instrument. Once established, the Guaranteed Rate of Interest will not
be modified for the term of the agreement. The considerations that will be taken into account in the negotiation process
will be essentially the same as those that affect guaranteed interest rates offered under conventional GICs. Under
its Synthetic GIC, Hartford Life will be willing to offer a Guaranteed Rate of Interest that takes into account the
rate of return it believes it will be able to achieve in managing the assets in the Account, based on currently available
investments that are consistent with the investment guidelines imposed by the Plan, and with allowance for Hartford
Life's quarterly management fees (see rep. 24, below). The applicants further represent that they and the Plans will
be aware of the rates that other companies are offering for similar products. Hartford Life represents that this,
together with the Plans' ability to negotiate the investment guidelines (and thus the level of risk) applicable to
the Account, will avoid any realistic potential for abuse. 


12. HIMCO will acknowledge in writing that it will be a fiduciary of each Plan and will be subject to the Act's fiduciary
standards in managing the assets in each such Plan's Account. The general investment objectives of the Account will
be current income with stability of principal. The agreement governing each Synthetic GIC will instruct HIMCO to
manage the Account to achieve a total return over the holding period to maturity which is sufficient to produce the
Synthetic GIC's Guaranteed Rate of Interest. 


13. Each Synthetic GIC will provide investment guidelines for achieving these investment objectives. While there
will be some flexibility in the investment guidelines to allow each Synthetic GIC portfolio to be customized to meet
the unique needs of the particular Plan, the guidelines will essentially call for HIMCO to apply the same investment
techniques that Hartford Life and other life insurance companies use in investing their own general account assets
so as to meet guaranteed benefit obligations under life insurance and annuity contracts. A central feature of these
techniques is the selection of a portfolio of securities matching contractual obligations as to timing and amount.

14. Under the guidelines, the Account will be required to be primarily invested in fixed income securities, while
maintaining a level of liquidity sufficient to provide for anticipated benefit payments by investing partly in traditional
money market securities. As a means of achieving a higher guaranteed return than would be possible by investing exclusively
in fixed income and money market securities, the guidelines will allow limited and properly hedged investment in
riskier securities such as common stocks, but they will not permit direct investment in real estate. The applicants
represent that limited investment in riskier securities will benefit the Plan by allowing Hartford Life to offer
a slightly higher Guaranteed Rate of Return than would be possible if the Account supporting the Synthetic GIC were
invested exclusively in fixed income and money market investments. Any investment in employer securities (within
the meaning of section 407(d) of the Act) will be subject to guidelines established by the Plan. 


15. Distributions prior to the Scheduled Account Termination Date which are subject to Hartford Life's guarantee
as to principal and interest (Scheduled Account Distributions) will occur on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates
(see rep. 10, above) and in amounts which will be agreed upon between a Plan and Hartford Life prior to the execution
of a Synthetic GIC and will be specified in writing. On each Scheduled Account Distribution date, HIMCO will be required
to liquidate securities sufficient to meet the Scheduled Account Distribution. In most instances, the assets will
be liquidated by a sale in the open market. However, Hartford Life reserves the right to purchase the assets to be liquidated.
When it elects to do so, Hartford Life must pay the fair market value of the asset as of the close of business on the date
of the sale, determined as set forth in rep. 21, below. Hartford Life will then distribute to the Plan an amount equal
to the Adjusted Book Value of the Scheduled Account Distribution. The Adjusted Book Value of the Account will then
be reduced by the amount of the Scheduled Account Distribution. To the extent that the market value of the assets liquidated
on a Scheduled Account Distribution Date exceeds the amount of the Scheduled Account Distribution, the excess will
be retained in the Account and reinvested. 


16. On the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the Bank will distribute to Hartford Life all of the assets in the Account,
and Hartford Life will simultaneously distribute to the Plan an amount which will not be less than the aggregate Adjusted
Book Value of the Account. As noted above, (see rep. 10, above), the Adjusted Book Value will generally be equal to contributions
plus the applicable Guaranteed Rate of Interest, with adjustments for previous withdrawals. If the aggregate market
value of the assets in the Account (determined as described in rep. 21, below) exceeds their Adjusted Book Value on
the Scheduled Account Termination Date, Hartford Life will be entitled to a portion of such excess, the amount of which
will be determined as a specified percentage of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account determined by agreement between
the Plan and Hartford Life and specified in the Synthetic GIC (the Book Value Assurance Charge), and will be required
to pay the remaining balance to the Plan. The Book Value Assurance Charge will be equal to a specified percentage of
the Adjusted Book Value of the Account, but will not exceed the market value of the Account less the Adjusted Book Value
of the Account, or be less than zero. To summarize, if the proceeds of the liquidated assets exceed the sum of the Adjusted
Book Value of the Account on that date and the Book Value Assurance Charge, such remainder will be distributed to the
Plan, thus allowing the Plan to receive a rate of return which is in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest. 


17. Hartford Life's guarantee will be implemented on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and on Scheduled Account
Termination Dates in the following manner: (1) On Scheduled Account Distribution Dates, HIMCO will liquidate assets
in the Account with a fair market value equal to the Scheduled Account Distribution. The assets liquidated will be
sold either on the securities market or to Hartford Life (the asset liquidation procedure is described in detail in
rep. 18, below). The proceeds will then be distributed to the Plan; and (2) On the Scheduled Account Termination Date,
HIMCO will liquidate the remaining assets in the Account. The assets liquidated will again be sold either on the securities
market or to Hartford Life. The Adjusted Book Value of the Account will be distributed from the Account to the Plan.
To the extent that the proceeds of the assets in the Account exceed the Adjusted Book Value of the Account, Hartford
Life will be entitled to the Book Value Assurance Charge (see rep. 16, above). The balance, if any, of the proceeds of
the asset liquidation will be paid to the Plan. HIMCO will select the assets that are sold to Hartford Life (instead
of being sold on the open market) on those dates (see reps 18 and 19, below). 


As a result, some of the investments in the Account may end up in Hartford Life's hands. The applicants represent that
this is an essential feature of the Synthetic GICs that will materially (and favorably) affect the Guaranteed Rate
of Interest that Hartford Life will be able to offer to a Plan. If assets trading at a discount from their face amount
on the Scheduled Account Termination Date had to be disposed of or simply distributed to the Plan from the Account on
that date, Hartford Life would be compelled to realize an immediate loss with respect to those assets in meeting its
contractual guarantee. By allowing these assets to be transferred to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the foregoing procedures for implementing the contractual guarantees
will make it possible for Hartford Life to hold such assets to maturity or until market conditions warrant disposing
of them. This in turn will enable Hartford Life to guarantee a higher rate of return than it would otherwise be able to
guarantee.

18. The applicants have made the following representations with respect to how securities to be sold to Hartford Life
on Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO. The
applicants state that the management of assets pursuant to an agreement to provide a guaranteed return calls for the
use of complex and sophisticated management techniques to make certain that cash flows will be available when needed.
In particular, fixed-income assets must be selected with maturities and yields that will enable the insurer to match
the maturity and yield of the guaranteed return agreement. To this end, securities are purchased in the expectation
that they will be liquidated on a particular date in order to provide the cash necessary to satisfy the insurer's obligation
to the contractholder on that date. 


Under the terms of Hartford Life's Synthetic GIC, the assets of the Account will be managed in accordance with these
risk management techniques. There will be a specific, identifiable pool of assets that will be internally designated
from the establishment of the Account for liquidation on each Scheduled Account Distribution Date (as well as on the
Scheduled Account Termination Date, when all of the remaining assets will be liquidated). In general, the securities
designated to be disposed of on a particular date will have maturities on or relatively soon after that date. From time
to time, depending on prevailing market conditions, the assets in an Account may be ``rebalanced''_i.e., reallocated
among the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. (The applicants represent
that the flexibility to reallocate the assets among the Synthetic GIC's maturity dates in the face of changing market
conditions is essential to the effective management of investment risks under a guaranteed return contract.) At
all times, however, all the assets in the Account will be designated for liquidation on a particular Scheduled Account
Distribution Date or the Scheduled Account Termination Date. The assets that will be disposed of on each Scheduled
Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will thus be those assets designated to be disposed
of on the relevant date, and in most cases, this designation will have been made at the time of acquisition. 


Regardless of whether they are sold to Hartford Life or on the open market, the assets designated for disposition on
each Scheduled Account Distribution Date and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be disposed of on the relevant
date at fair market value. The securities that will be sold to Hartford Life on the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date will be selected by HIMCO from among the securities designated to
be disposed of on those dates, based on Hartford Life's needs for securities with specific cash-flow patterns and
maturities for its general account portfolio. 


19. The applicants represent that they recognize that HIMCO's ``rebalancing'' of Account securities could be viewed
as involving a conflict of interest, in that HIMCO would be in a position to deprive the Plan of any return in excess of
the Guaranteed Rate of Interest by targeting assets expected to appreciate for sale to Hartford Life on Scheduled
Account Distribution Dates.

3

 However, the applicants represent that there will be no realistic opportunity for abuse in the subject transactions
for the following reasons: 






(a) The likelihood that the fair market value of the assets in the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date
will exceed the sum of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge will be negligible.
The securities that will be purchased for the Account will consist primarily of fixed-income securities with limited
potential for capital appreciation, and will generally be targeted to mature on or near the Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates and the Scheduled Account Termination Date. Plans will not purchase the Synthetic GIC in the expectation of
a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest; instead, they will purchase it in order to receive a guaranteed
return with the additional security that direct ownership of the underlying assets will afford. 


(b) Any potential for abuse will be offset by a countervailing interest on the part of Hartford Life in making certain
that the value of the Account is adequate to meet its contractual guarantee on the Scheduled Account Termination Date.
As noted above, any excess return to the Plan will be unanticipated and unlikely. Hartford Life, on the other hand,
will bear the risk that the assets in the Account will be inadequate to provide the amount guaranteed on the Scheduled
Account Termination Date. This risk will be minimized if the Account retains assets which are expected to appreciate.



(c) As a practical matter, abuses on a scale sufficient to materially benefit Hartford Life and adversely affect a
Plan will simply not be feasible. The need to manage the assets in the Account to achieve the Guaranteed Rate of Interest
will severely constrict HIMCO's flexibility to manipulate the assets disposed of on Scheduled Account Distribution
Dates. To systematically pick and choose those assets with a view to selling desirable assets to Hartford Life would
seriously upset the predictability of cash flows available to meet subsequent guarantees, imposing unacceptable
risks on Hartford Life that would far outweigh any potential benefit of such a scheme.

(d) The Plan will have complete records of all transactions of the Account (see rep. 25, below) and will be able to discontinue
the Synthetic GIC (see rep. 23, below) if it discovers that HIMCO has engaged in abusive conduct. 

20. The applicants represent that no brokerage costs will be imposed with respect to the sale of the assets in an Account
to Hartford Life or an affiliate pursuant to these provisions. With brokerage costs eliminated, the only transaction
costs that will be incurred in selling the assets in question will be the costs of recording the change in ownership
of these assets. The ability to minimize transaction costs will run to the benefit of the Plan by enabling Hartford
Life to provide a higher Guaranteed Rate of Interest to the Plan. 

21. The applicants represent that the assets in which the Account has invested (which are expected to be primarily
fixed-income securities, and to a lesser extent common stocks and other assets) will be valued as follows: 

(a) In the case of a security traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section 6 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Hartford Life will pay the closing price on the exchange on the date of the transaction; and 

(b) In the case of a security other than one traded on a national securities exchange which is registered under section
6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, HIMCO will obtain quotations in U.S. dollars (regardless of whether the security
in question is denominated in a foreign currency) from at least three unaffiliated financial institutions that serve
as market makers for the security, and Hartford Life will pay a price equal to the highest of the three quotations. The
three quotations will be obtained on the date of the transaction (i.e., a Scheduled Account Distribution Date or the
Scheduled Account Termination Date). Each quotation will represent the bid price offered by the financial institution
in question as of the time of the quotation, which will be simultaneous with the processing of the distribution to the
Plan. 

In no event will Hartford Life or HIMCO make valuations themselves. The role of Hartford Life and HIMCO in the valuation
process will be limited to ministerial functions and the selection of the independent financial institutions from
which valuations will be obtained. 

22. The Synthetic GICs will be designed to provide adequate liquidity to enable Plans to meet their benefit obligations.
Thus, a Synthetic GIC will allow for unscheduled withdrawals from the Account (Benefit Sensitivity Advances) prior
to the Scheduled Account Termination Date under certain circumstances. A Plan will be able to make Benefit Sensitivity
Advances on ten days' notice for the purpose of providing the necessary funds to meet the Plan's benefit obligations
as they fall due. A Plan fiduciary may be required by Hartford Life to furnish documentation demonstrating that the
benefit payment is in fact required under the terms of the Plan. There is no charge or fee for Benefit Sensitivity Advances.
Benefit Sensitivity Advances will consist of cash distributions from the Account. When a Benefit Sensitivity Advance
is requested, HIMCO will be required to liquidate securities in the Account on the open securities market with an aggregate
fair market value equal to the amount necessary to meet the Plan's request. The proceeds will then be distributed to
the Plan, and the amount distributed will be subtracted from the Adjusted Book Value of the Account.

<PARENT> FR940512-2-00055 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

23. A Plan will be allowed to discontinue its Account on 15 days' notice at any time, effective as of the last trading
day of the month, except on the Scheduled Account Termination Date or a Scheduled Account Distribution Date.

4

 On discontinuance, the market value of the Account will be distributed to the Plan, subject to a ``Discontinuance
Charge''. Like the Book Value Assurance Charge (see rep. 16, above), the Discontinuance Charge will be equal to a specified
percentage of the Adjusted Book Value of the Account determined by agreement between Hartford Life and the Plan and
specified in the Synthetic GIC, but will not be greater than the excess of the market value of the Account over the Adjusted
Book Value on the date of discontinuance nor less than zero. 





Accordingly, a Plan will be free to give notice of discontinuance of the arrangement and realize its investment return
from its Account (subject to the Discontinuance Charge) at any time up to 45 days before the Scheduled Account Termination
Date. For example, if the Plan determines that the return generated by HIMCO's investment management net of the Discontinuance
Charge is more valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee, the Plan will be able to realize that return through the discontinuance
provision. 

24. Under its Synthetic GICs, Hartford Life will be entitled to a quarterly fee based on a percentage of the average
Adjusted Book Value of the assets in the Account for the current quarter. This percentage will be established by agreement
with each Plan and will be specified in writing. Out of its quarterly fee, Hartford Life will pay HIMCO a quarterly management
fee which will also be specified in writing. No separate fee will be paid directly to HIMCO. HIMCO will have the right
to withdraw from the Account certain expenses incurred directly in the investment management of the Account. Any
such expenses withdrawn directly from the Account by HIMCO are not subtracted from the adjusted book value of the Account.


25. Hartford Life will keep full and complete records and books of account reflecting all transactions of each Plan's
Account and will make them available on an annual basis for audit by independent certified public accountants selected
by and responsible to the Plan. Hartford Life will also furnish annual reports of the operations of the Account containing
a list of the investments of the Account to an independent fiduciary of the Plan. 

26. To summarize, the applicants represent that the Synthetic GIC is fundamentally a guaranteed investment contract.
A Plan will place specified assets in the Account, and on the Scheduled Account Distribution Dates and the Scheduled
Account Termination Date, Hartford Life will repay the Plan its principal plus interest at a guaranteed rate, in exchange
for the asset value of the Account (in cash or in kind). Thus, the fundamental nature of the Synthetic GIC is equivalent
to that of the conventional GICs which have funded employee benefit plans for many years. With the Synthetic GIC, the
Plan is afforded a higher degree of security because the assets underlying the Synthetic GIC will be held in a custodial
bank account owned by the Plan and will not become part of the insurance company's assets. In addition, the Synthetic
GIC will offer the Plan a limited opportunity to realize a return in excess of the Guaranteed Rate of Interest. This
will occur if the market value of the Account on the Scheduled Account Termination Date exceeds the sum of the Adjusted
Book Value of the Account and the Book Value Assurance Charge. The Plan will also have the option of discontinuing the
arrangement if it believes that the market value of the assets in the Account (less the Discontinuance Charge) is more
valuable than Hartford Life's guarantee. The applicants represent that it is not very likely that such an excess return
will occur, because the assets in the Account will be managed with the intention of achieving the guaranteed return.
In this regard, the applicants represent that on the Scheduled Account Termination Date, the assets will consist
primarily of fixed-income securities at or near maturity with predictable values. Nevertheless, the Plan enjoys
downside protection through Hartford Life's guarantee, and also has an opportunity to realize a return in excess
of the Guaranteed Rate of Return. 

27. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) the decision to enter into a Synthetic GIC will be made on behalf of a
Plan by a fiduciary of the Plan who is independent of Hartford Life and HIMCO, after receipt of full and detailed disclosure
of all material features of the contract, including all applicable fees and charges; (b) the guaranteed return to
the Plan cannot be modified by the proposed transactions; (c) all fees and charges imposed under the Synthetic GIC
will be reasonable; (d) each Synthetic GIC will specifically provide for determinations of the market value of the
securities by an objective means of valuation; (e) Hartford Life will maintain books and records of all transactions
which will be subject to annual audit by independent certified public accountants selected by and responsible solely
to the Plan; and (f) the Synthetic GIC will be offered only in principal amounts of $50 million or more, so that the Plan
fiduciaries can be expected to be knowledgeable, sophisticated professional asset managers.

Radiation Medical Group Inc. Profit Sharing_401(k) Salary Savings Plan (the Original Plan), and Radiology Medical
Group, Inc. 401(k) Salary 
Savings Plan (the New Plan; Together, the Plans) Located in San Diego, California; Proposed Exemption



[Application Nos. D-9343 & D-9344] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 F.R. 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the proposed transfer by the Original Plan of a 57 percent interest (the Interest)
in certain real property (the Property), including a 57 percent lessor's interest, to the New Plan; and (2) the proposed
leases of the Property (the New Leases) by the Original Plan and the New Plan to Radiology Medical Group, Inc., and Radiation
Medical Group, Inc. (together, the Employers), the sponsors of the Plans; provided the following conditions are
satisfied: 


(A) All terms of the transactions are no less favorable to the Plans than those which the Plans could obtain in arm's-length
transactions with unrelated parties; 


(B) The interests of the Plans under the New Leases are represented by an independent fiduciary, the Union Bank of San
Diego, California (the Fiduciary), which will monitor the Employers' performance of obligations under the New Leases
and compliance with the conditions of this exemption, including all actions necessary to enforce such obligations
and conditions; 


(C) At all times under the New Leases, the Plans receive rent which is no less than the fair market rental value of the
Property and which is net of all real estate taxes and costs of repair, maintenance and insurance; 


(D) At all times under the New Leases, each Plan's interest in the Property constitutes less than twenty-five percent
of the total value of all assets held by the Plan; and 

(E) Any extension or renewal of the New Leases beyond the initial terms is expressly approved by the Fiduciary. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 



1. The Original Plan is a 401(k) profit sharing plan formerly named ``Radiology Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan'',
which was established by Radiology Medical Group, Inc. (the Original Employer), a California professional corporation
engaged in the general practice of radiological medicine in San Diego, California. Effective January 1, 1990, the
Original Employer underwent a corporate reorganization, resulting in the creation of an additional professional
corporation, Radiation Medical Group, Inc. (the New Employer), to assume the radiation therapy portion of the medical
practice previously performed by the Original Employer. The employees performing the radiation therapy services
were transferred to the New Employer. The Employers are separate entities, with no common shareholders or employees.
The Original Plan was amended to change its name to its current name and to enable the New Employer to adopt the Original
Plan for its employees. 


Effective January 1, 1992, the boards of directors of the Original Employer and the New Employer (together, the Employers)
determined that the Employers should maintain separate retirement plans. The New Employer continued as the sponsor
of the Original Plan, and the Original Employer adopted the New Plan as a 401(k) profit sharing plan for its employees.
The assets of both Plans are maintained under one trust, the trustee of which is the Union Bank in San Diego, California
(the Trustee), which was formerly named California First Bank. 

2. Among the assets in the Original Plan is the Property, a parcel of real property located at 2466 First Avenue in San
Diego, California. The Original Employer owns a medical office building and other improvements on the Property which
are maintained as the Employers' principal place of business. The Original Employer leases the Property from the
Original Plan (the Original Lease) pursuant to an individual administrative exemption granted by the Department,
Prohibited Transaction Exemption 84-175 (PTE 84-175, 49 FR 48834, December 14, 1984). Pursuant to PTE
84-175, the interests of the Original Plan under the Original Lease are represented by the Trustee. Since the
corporate reorganization, the Employers share the use of the Property, and the Original Employer continues as lessee
under the Original Lease. The Original Plan, sponsored by the New Employer, continues to hold title to the Property.
The participant accounts of employees of the Original Employer, now participating in the New Plan, constitute 57
percent of the assets of the Original Plan. The participant accounts of employees of the New Employer, now participating
in the Original Plan, constitute 43 percent of the assets of the Original Plan. 


The Employers have determined that each Plan should own a proportionate interest in the Property, in direct relation
to each Plan's proportionate interests in the assets of the Original Plan. Accordingly, the Employers propose to
direct the Trustee to transfer a 57 percent interest in the Property (the Interest) from the Original Plan to the New
Plan, representing the ownership interest of the New Plan participants in the Property. Additionally, the Employers
propose that the Plans lease their respective interests in the Property to the Employers pursuant to a modification
and continuation of the Original Lease in the form of two separate leases. The Employers are requesting an exemption
for such transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.

3. To effect the transfer of the Interest from the Original Plan to the New Plan, the Employers will direct the Trustee
to establish separate trusts for each of the Plans, and to transfer from the existing Original Plan trust a 57 percent
ownership interest in the Property to a new trust established exclusively for assets of the New Plan. The Original
Plan will retain the remaining 43 percent interest in the Property. The Interest will be transferred subject to the
Original Lease, and the Employers will direct the Trustee to transfer to the New Plan a 57 percent lessor's interest
in the Original Lease, while the Original Plan will continue to own a 43 percent lessor's interest in the Original Lease.
The Property had a fair market value of $1,050,000 as of December 16, 1992, according to Steven L. Bowen, MAI (Bowen),
an independent professional real estate appraiser in San Diego, California. The Employers represent that total
assets in the Original Plan were valued at $13,177,499.29 as of December 31, 1992, including account balances of all
participants in both Plans. 

4. It is proposed that each Employer, as lessee, will execute a separate lease with both Plans, as lessors (the New Leases),
to enable the Employers' lease of the Property from the Plans under the same terms and conditions as the Original Lease
(except for provisions relating to rental review, described below). Under each New Lease, the Plans will be co-lessors
of the Property, and each Employer will be a lessee. Based upon their proportionate uses of the Property and the improvements
thereon, the Employers have determined that the Original Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to 58 percent
of the Property, while the New Employer will execute a New Lease with respect to the remaining 42 percent, and each Employer
will be responsible for the corresponding percentage of the Property's total rent and all other expenses relating
to taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repair of the Property. 

The Trustee will continue to act as an independent fiduciary and will represent the interests of the Plans under the
New Leases by overseeing and enforcing the Employers' performance of lease obligations and by securing compliance
with the conditions of this exemption, if granted. The Trustee represents that at all times under the Original Lease,
the Original Employer has been in compliance with all lease terms and all conditions of PTE 84-175. 

5. The proposed New Leases are triple net leases with initial terms ending April 30, 2004, the same termination date
of the Original Lease initial term. Rent is payable monthly under the New Leases, which provide for a review of the annual
rent every two years on February 1, commencing as soon after February 1, 1994 as the Department publishes the exemption
proposed herein, if granted. Such review will be conducted by an independent, unrelated professional real estate
appraiser selected by the Trustee. Any adjustment of rent resulting from such review shall be upward only, and any
decrease in the fair market rental value of the Property shall not result in any decrease in the rent under the New Leases.
In accordance with this procedure, initial rent under the New Leases will be no less than the greater of (a) $13,750
per month, which is the current rent under the Original Lease, or (b) the fair market rental value of the Property as
determined as of the initial date of the New Leases by the appraiser selected by the Trustee. 

The New Leases require the Employers to pay all repair and maintenance costs of the Property, to pay all real estate
taxes on the Property, and to carry fire, extended coverage and public liability insurance on the Property to the full
extent of the insurable value of the Property, with the Plans as the named insured. Under the New Leases, the Employers
agree to indemnify the Plans and hold the Plans harmless from all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities of
any nature arising from the Employers' use of the Property. 

Each New Lease will provide that upon the expiration of its initial term, with the approval of the Trustee, the Employers
may extend the New Lease for up to two additional terms of five years each upon written notice to the Trustee at least
six months prior to the expiration of the initial term or the expiration of the first five-year renewal term, whichever
is applicable. Rental under such extended five-year term(s) will be payable pursuant to the same procedures required
by the New Leases during the initial term, including rental review every two years. 

6. The Trustee represents that after a review and analysis, it has approved the proposed transactions on behalf of
the participants and beneficiaries of the Plans. In this regard, the Trustee engaged the services of two independent
advisers (the Advisers) to serve in fiduciary capacities on behalf of the Plans in determining whether the retention
of a 43 percent interest in the Property by the Original Plan and the receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property
by the New Plan are prudent investments for the Plans and in the best interests of their participants and beneficiaries.
The Advisers were also engaged to determine whether the New Leases constitute prudent investments for the Plans and
whether their terms and conditions are protective of the Plans' participants and beneficiaries.

7. One of the Advisers is Moody, Nation and Smith (Moody), a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was
retained by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the Original Plan with respect to the proposed
transactions. Moody, which represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, represents that
it undertook a complete analysis of the real estate market in which the Property is situated as part of its evaluation
of the Property and the New Leases as an investment for the Original Plan. In a written report to the Trustee, Moody concluded
that the Original Plan's 43 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases, will
constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and beneficiaries
of the Original Plan. Moody states that it has determined that the Property provides a favorable and secure rate of
return and will remain a stable real estate investment well into the future. Moody represents that its research reveals
that the Property is located in a stable and well-established market area which fared better than other areas in San
Diego during the protracted city-wide real estate market declines between 1980 and 1990. Moody represents that other
factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following findings: 

(A) The Original Plan's assets will remain adequately diversified, in that its interest in the Property constitutes
approximately 10.6 percent of all assets of the Original Plan's participants as of February 1994; (B) The Original
Plan's return on its investment in the Property, the rental under the New Leases, is net of real estate taxes and all
expenses related to repair, maintenance and insurance of the Property; (C) Any extension of the New Leases after the
expiration of the initial term on April 30, 2004 will require the approval of the Trustee and will be limited to no more
than two terms of five years each; (D) Rental under the New Leases will always be at least the fair market value of the
Property, due to provisions requiring periodic rental review, and rent is adjustable only upward, never reduced,
in the event of changes in the Property's fair market value as the New Leases proceed. Moody states that it determined
that the fair market rental for comparable land leases in the same market as the Property is a 10 percent annual return
on the fair market value of the subject land, and the current rental under the Original Lease, which can not be reduced
under the New Lease, provides an annual return of approximately 15 percent; (E) The provisions of the New Leases further
protect the Original Plan's investment in the Property by requiring the Employers to indemnify and hold harmless
the Plans, including costs and attorneys fees, with respect to all claims, demands, liens, losses and liabilities
arising from the lessees' use and occupancy of the Property; and (F) The interests of the Original Plan under the New
Leases will continue to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor
and enforce the Employers' performance of obligations under the New Leases. 

Moody also represents that it has analyzed the proposed transactions in the context of other alternatives available
to the Original Plan with respect to its interest in the Property. Moody states that alternative investments returning
a comparable rate are not available to the Original Plan in the marketplace without a material attendant risk or large
losses of principal. Moody represents that market conditions are unfavorable for any attempt to sell the Property,
and additionally, that it would be disadvantageous for the Original Plan to accept cash in lieu of its undivided 43
percent ownership interest in the Property, because the alternative investments available will provide significantly
lower returns than those provided by the Property and the New Leases. Moody states that its market research demonstrates
that the area in which the Property is situated will continue to experience stability and attractiveness to both tenants
and owners, due to the proximity to major medical and commercial centers and the lack of vacant land for new developments.
Moody contends that these conditions present a realistic potential for increases in the rent under the New Leases
over the next ten years.

8. The other Adviser is Ernst & Young (E&Y) a financial consulting firm located in San Diego, which was retained
by the Trustee to make determinations as a fiduciary on behalf of the New Plan with respect to the proposed transactions.
E&Y represents that it is independent of and unrelated to the Employers, and that it undertook a thorough evaluation
of the proposed transactions which included an investigation of the decline in commercial real property values in
San Diego over the past several years, an overview of current and historical market conditions specific to medical
office properties, an overview of the currently local economy and real estate market conditions, and an evaluation
of the Property's rate of return and long term potential. In a written report to the Trustee, E&Y concluded that
the New Plan's receipt of a 57 percent interest in the Property, and its lease to the Employers under the New Leases,
will constitute a prudent investment which features adequate protections and safeguards for the participants and
beneficiaries of the New Plan. E&Y states that it determined that the Property offers the Plan a secure rate of
return above market rates, with a likelihood of continuing stability well into the future. E&Y represents that
through market research it has determined that the Property is located in a market area which has achieved stability
after the declines in San Diego real estate markets during the 1980's. E&Y states that the Property has good long-term
potential as a plan investment and that the New Leases provide a protected, favorable rate of return on the investment
in the Property. E&Y represents that factors involved in and supporting its recommendation included the following
findings: 
(A) Rental under the New Leases will always be no less than the Property's fair market rental value, as determined every
two years, and may not be decreased, so that the rate of return of approximately 15 percent is assured and is substantially
higher than the prevailing market rate of approximately 10 percent; (B) The New Plan is protected by the Employers'
indemnification of the Plans for all claims, demands, and liabilities arising from the Employers' occupancy of the
Property; (C) The triple net provisions of the New Leases will protect the New Plan's return on the Property from all
costs and expenses associated with the Property; and (D) The interests of the New Plan under the New Leases will continue
to be represented and protected by the Trustee, an independent fiduciary which will monitor and enforce the Employers'
performance of obligations under the New Leases. 
E&Y also represents that it determined that the New Plan's 57 percent interest in the Property constituted approximately
6.25 percent of the value of all assets held by the New Plan as of February 1994, and that this low composition of real
estate investments minimizes risk to the Plan's investment portfolio. E&Y represents that its evaluation of
the proposed transactions also included consideration of alternatives available to the New Plan with respect to
its interest in the Property. E&Y states that the investments that would be available for the New Plan's investment
of cash, in the amount of and in lieu of its interest in the Property, would provide returns significantly reduced from
the return offered by the Property. E&Y also states that any prospective sale of the Property would be unlikely
to generate cash equal to the fair market value of the Property, due to the costs involved and the lengthy, aggressive
marketing required by current economic conditions. E&Y concludes its report with its finding that its ``de novo''
analysis of the proposed transactions indicates that it is in the best interests and protective of the New Plan's participants
and beneficiaries to accept the interest in the Property and proceed with the New Leases of the Property to the Employers.

9. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (1) The transactions enable the participants of both Plans to continue to share
interests in the Property and its lease to the Employers pursuant to the New Leases, under the same material terms and
conditions of the Original Lease; (2) The interests of the Plans will be represented under the New Leases by the Trustee,
an independent fiduciary which has represented the Original Plan under the Original Lease and which will continue
to monitor performance of the terms and conditions of the New Leases on behalf of the Plans; (3) The New Leases, under
which rent may not be reduced, will provide a favorable return, net of all costs and expenses, of no less than the Property's
fair market rental value; (4) The New Leases, with initial terms expiring April 30, 2004, may be renewed only with the
approval of the Trustee and for no more than two terms of five years each; and (5) The Trustee has approved the proposed
transactions on the basis of the evaluations and analyses performed by the Advisers.

Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. In 1991, a pension plan (the Pension Plan) sponsored by the Employer was terminated, and a form 5310 (Application
for Determination upon Termination) was filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and a favorable IRS determination
was received. At that time the assets of the Pension Plan were merged into the Plan, including the 1/2 interest in the
property located at 1831 West Clinch Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee (the Clinch Property). The Plan is a profit sharing
plan, currently with 16 participants. As of February 18, 1994, the Plan had total assets of $3,716,331. The Employer
is a Tennessee subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in the practice of medicine. The owners and officers of the Employer
are the following doctors: Dr. Richard A. Brinner, Dr. Randal O. Graham, Dr. Hugh C. Hyatt, Dr. Michael D. Kropilak
and Dr. P. Kevin Zirkle. The Trust Company of Knoxville is the trustee and the named fiduciary for the Plan. 
2. The Employer was granted an individual exemption by the Department in 1982 (PTE 82-162), for the Plan and the
Pension Plan to purchase (the Past Purchase) the Clinch Property from a certain partnership which was a party in interest
with respect to the Plans, and for a subsequent lease (the Past Lease) of the Clinch Property by the Plans to the Employer.
The Past Lease was for a term of five years with an option to renew for an additional five years. PTE 82-162 also
required an annual appraisal of the Clinch Property, and for the rentals to be adjusted to reflect the fair market rental
value of the Clinch Property. Valley Fidelity Bank and Trust Company (Valley Bank) of Knoxville, Tennessee was the
independent fiduciary which monitored the Past Purchase and the Past Lease for the Plans. PTE 82-162 also provided
for an Employer guarantee that if the Clinch Property was ever sold during the initial five year term of the Lease and
the five year renewal of the Lease for below the original purchase price, the Employer would indemnify the Plans for
the difference between the original purchase price of the Property and the selling price.

3. In 1988 Valley Bank was replaced by a new independent fiduciary, the Trust Company of Knoxville (the Trust Company).
Also, in July, 1988, significant improvements of a capital nature were made to the Clinch Property. The applicant
represented that these improvements cost approximately $102,685.76, and were paid for by the Plan.

5

 The applicant also represented that immediately after the improvements were installed, the Clinch Property was
appraised. The appraisal did not result in an increase in value of the Clinch Property, and therefore, in accordance
with the Past Lease, no rental increase was made. Nevertheless, it is represented that the Trust Company demanded
an increase in rent from the Employer, in order to amortize the expenses sustained by the Plan. A rental increase of
$2,000 per month was agreed to in May, 1989, and by letter of agreement dated June 9, 1989, between the Trust Company
and the Employer, a new rental rate was set for the next five years until May, 1994.

6

 This modification of the Past Lease by the applicant caused the Past Lease to extend beyond the original ten (10) year
term specified under PTE 82-162. Under PTE 82-162, the Past Lease was to expire October 15, 1992.

4. The applicant now proposes the following transactions. Initially, the Plan desires to swap (the Swap) the Clinch
Property, currently appraised at $425,000, for a certain condominium (the Condominium), projected to have a fair
market value of $750,000, once it is completed.

8

 The Condominium is Unit 501 in the Professional Office Building III located at 501 Nineteenth Street, Knoxville,
Tennessee. Neither the Clinch Property nor the Condominium are encumbered by debt. The Swap will be an even exchange
and will not involve any cash payments or other consideration by the involved parties. The Condominium will represent
approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. 





5. The Plan will be acquiring the Condominium from Fort Sanders Medical Center (the Center), formerly known as Fort
Sanders Presbyterian Hospital (the Hospital). The applicant represented that the Center is not a related party with
respect to the Plan and the Employer.

9

 It is represented that the Center is desirous of proceeding with the Swap primarily because it owns all the properties
surrounding it with the exception of the Clinch Property. It is further represented that the Clinch Property is more
valuable to the Center for its raw land than to another party as a free standing building. 





6. The Clinch Property and the Condominium were appraised by Richard E. Wallace, MAI, SRA (Mr. Wallace), an independent
qualified appraiser. The Clinch Property was appraised by 
Mr. Wallace (the Appraisal) on November 4, 1991, at a fair market value of $425,000. The Clinch Property is located
at the northeast corner of Clinch Avenue and 19th Street in Knoxville, Tennessee. The Clinch Property is a one story
masonry office building with a finished basement. Mr. Wallace maintains that properties similar to the Clinch Property
are most often bought and sold based on their income producing ability, and, as such, he gives the income approach the
most emphasis. The income approach as it is utilized herein is based on market derived income and expense estimates
as well as general investor demands for this type of an investment. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the Appraisal, Mr.
Wallace restated his opinion that the Clinch Property has a fair market value of $425,000. 

7. On July 2, 1992, Mr. Wallace also determined the fair market value of the Condominium. Because the Condominium office
space was unfinished, Mr. Wallace prepared a consultation report (the Report), rather than an appraisal. Mr. Wallace
represents that a fully documented appraisal would yield the same value as a consultation report that was prepared.
In determining the fair market value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace considered sales of other medical condominiums
in Knoxville. In the Report, Mr. Wallace determined that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market value of the Condominium,
which consists of 6,000 square feet, was $125 per square foot for finished space. On June 30, 1993, in an update to the
Report, Mr. Wallace estimated the fair market value of the Condominium to be $750,000. In establishing the fair rental
value of the Condominium, Mr. Wallace examined rentals of medical facilities in the Knoxville area, and determined
that as of July 2, 1992, the fair market rental rate for the Condominium is estimated at $12.50 per square foot for a triple
net lease, increasing at 3% annually. 

8. Once the Plan acquires the Condominium from the Center, it is proposed that the Plan lease (the Lease) the Condominium
to the Employer. The Lease will be a triple net lease and will be net of maintenance, repairs, insurance, taxes, utilities
and condominium fees. The Lease will have a term of three years, with two renewal options (Renewal) of three years each.
Renewals will occur upon the Employer, as the Lessee, notifying the Plan, as the Lessor, in writing at least 60 days
before the end of the expiring term. The rental rate will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at each
Renewal. In this regard, Mr. Wallace determined the rental rate for the Condominium as of July 2, 1992, to be $12.50
per square foot. The rental rate will be $75,000 per year for the first year, payable in equal monthly installments
of $6,250 per month. For the second year, the rental rate will be $77,250 per year payable at the rate of $6,437.50 per
month, and for the third year the rental rate will be $79,567.50 per year, payable at the rate of $6,630.63 per month.
The Employer will obtain a fire and hazard/casualty insurance policy for the Condominium. The Plan as the Lessee will
be the beneficiary and loss payee with respect to the hazard and liability insurance on the Condominium. 

9. The Employer has also represented that if the Condominium is sold during the initial term of the Lease plus the two
Renewal terms for less than $425,000 (the fair market value of the Clinch Property), the Employer will indemnify the
Plan for the difference between the price received by the Plan and $425,000 (the Indemnity Agreement), in cash within
six months after notice and verification of sale. It is represented that if it is contemplated that the Condominium
be sold to a party in interest with respect to the Plan, as defined by section 3(14) of the Act, the applicant will seek
exemptive relief from the Department prior to the consummation of the sale.

In addition to the Indemnity Agreement, in the event the Employer defaults on the Lease, the principals of the Employer
(the Principals) have guaranteed (the Guarantee) the rental payments to the Plan for the duration of the Lease, including
the Renewals. It is represented that as of September 2, 1993, the Principals had minimum net worth of approximately
$2,600,000. 


10. The independent fiduciary for the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee will be Earl W. Johnson
(Mr. Johnson), a certified public accountant and an executive vice president over tax and financial planning with
Lawhorn Johnson and Company, P.C. Mr. Johnson represents that he is independent of all parties to these transactions,
and that he had no prior professional or personal association with any of the parties. Mr. Johnson also maintains that
the fees received by him for serving in the independent fiduciary capacity in these transactions, combined with any
other fees derived from the Employer or related parties will not exceed 1% of his annual income for each fiscal year
that he continues to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity with respect to the transactions described herein.


11. Mr. Johnson states that he is qualified to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity for the Plan because of his
professional experience which includes providing administrative services to qualified retirement plans, and
handling real estate transactions. Specifically, with respect to his clients, 
Mr. Johnson has prepared retirement plan calculations, made investment projections and reviewed investment alternatives.
Mr. Johnson has also reviewed audits of retirement plans. 


12. Mr. Johnson represents that he has consulted with legal counsel regarding his ERISA fiduciary responsibilities
and accepts and acknowledges these responsibilities as they relate to the proposed Plan transactions. Mr. Johnson
also maintains that he has knowledge of ERISA and understands the fiduciary responsibilities under the law associated
with qualified retirement plans. In his capacity as the independent fiduciary, he reviewed the Plan's assets with
respect to the Swap and the Lease, and concluded that the Swap offers a significant premium to the Plan, and is in the
best interest of the Plan participants. Mr. Johnson also states that the Lease offers a fair rental value to the Plan.
According to Mr. Johnson, under the Lease terms, the Plan has the option to renew the Lease pursuant to the two Renewal
options. As required by the Lease, the Condominium will be appraised every time that the Lease is renewed. Mr. Johnson
represents that the Condominium will be appraised at the time it is finished and the Swap is completed. He further represents
that as an additional safeguard the Condominium will also be appraised annually by an independent qualified appraiser.
With respect to the Indemnity Agreement, Mr. Johnson represents that the Principals of the Employer have sufficient
financial net worth to indemnify the Plan. Also, 
Mr. Johnson states that the Guarantee by the Principals of the Lease payments to the Plan during the initial Lease and
the Renewal periods, is additional security for the Plan. As such, Mr. Johnson represents that the Swap and the Lease
are also protective of the Plan and administratively feasible. The Condominium will be considered part of the fixed
income portion of the Plan's portfolio, and when the value of the Condominium increases, there will be an offsetting
reduction in existing fixed assets to maintain the proper asset allocation. The remaining Plan assets are represented
by stocks and bonds. There are participant loans in the Plan, but these loans represent a very small percentage of the
Plan's assets. 


13. Mr. Johnson represents that the proposed transactions are administratively feasible, in the interest and protective
of the Plan. Mr. Johnson states that the Swap is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the Condominium
has been appraised by an independent qualified appraiser at $750,000, and the acquisition of the Condominium will
result in a significant premium to the Plan. Subsequently, the Plan will lease the Condominium to the Employer. The
fair market value of the Condominium represents approximately 20% of the Plan's total assets. Mr. Johnson will monitor
the Lease throughout its initial term of three years and during the two year Renewal terms. The Condominium will be
appraised annually and at every Renewal, and the fair market rental will be determined by an independent qualified
appraiser at each Renewal. The annual rental amounts will never be below $75,000, which is the annual rental amount
for the initial year of the Lease. Furthermore, the rental payments have been personally guaranteed by the Principals
for the initial term of the Lease plus the two Renewal terms. The Principals have also indemnified the Plan in the event
that the Condominium is sold for an amount less than $425,000 during the initial term of the Lease and during the two
Renewal terms. The Plan will incur no expenses as a result of the proposed transactions described herein. 


14. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: 

(1) All terms and conditions of the Swap, the Lease, the Indemnity Agreement and the Guarantee are at least as favorable
to the Plan as those the Plan could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 


(2) The fair market value of the Condominium will be determined by an independent qualified appraiser at the time the
Swap transaction is consummated; 


(3) With respect to the Lease, the Rental Amount has been determined by an independent qualified appraiser, and will
never be below $75,000, which is the fair market rental amount for the initial year of the Lease; 


(4) The Condominium will be appraised by an independent qualified appraiser each time that the Renewal option on the
Lease is exercised; 


(5) The fair market value of the Condominium will at no time exceed 25% of the Plan's total assets; 


(6) The Lease is a triple net lease under which the Employer is obligated for all costs of maintenance and repair, and
all taxes, insurance, utilities and condominium fees related to the Condominium;

(7) The fees received by the independent fiduciary for serving in such capacity, combined with any other fees derived
from the Employer or related parties, will not exceed 1% of his annual income for each fiscal year that he continues
to serve in the independent fiduciary capacity with respect to the transactions described herein; 


(8) The independent fiduciary evaluated the proposed transactions described herein and deemed them to be administratively
feasible, protective and in the interest of the Plan; 


(9) The independent fiduciary will monitor the terms and the conditions of the exemption and the Lease throughout
its initial term plus the two Renewal terms and will take whatever action is necessary to protect the Plan's rights;



(10) The Plan will bear no costs or expenses with respect to the proposed transactions; and 


(11) The Employer will file form 5330 and pay the appropriate excise taxes for the period beginning June 9, 1989, to
the date this proposed exemption, if granted, is published in the 

Federal Register

, within ninety (90) days of the publication date.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards
Considerations </DOCTITLE>


I. Background 


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person. 
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from April 18, 1994, through
April 29, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on April 28, 1994 (59 FR 22000). 


Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 


The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
By June 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to (Project Director): petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved. 


Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. STN 50-456 and STN 50-457, Braidwood Station, Unit Nos. 1 and
2, Will County, Illinois 




Date of amendment request: 

March 30, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.4.9, Pressure/Temperature Limits, and its
associated Bases, by changing the Unit 1 heatup and cooldown curves to incorporate a newly determined reactor vessel
reference nil-ductility temperature, RT

NDT

, and by updating the removal schedule of vessel surveillance capsules for both units in accordance with ASTM E185-82.
Changes would also be made to the Unit 1 Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) setpoint curve in
TS 3.4.9.3 to reflect the new pressure/temperature limits. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
A. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The use of new pressure-temperature limit curves and low temperature overpressure protection curves will not change
any postulated accident scenarios. The revised curves were developed using industry standards and regulations
which are recognized as being inherently conservative. The pressure-temperature low temperature overpressure
curves provide reactor coolant system (RCS) limits to protect the reactor pressure vessel from brittle fracture
by clearly separating the region of normal operations from the region where the vessel is subject to brittle fracture.
The heatup and cooldown limits are designed to ensure that the 10 CFR 50 Appendix G Pressure Temperature limits for
the RCS are not exceeded during any condition of normal operation including anticipated operational occurrences.

General Design Criterion 32 of 10 CFR 50 Appendix A requires that the reactor coolant boundary shall be designed with
sufficient margin to assure that when stressed under operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident
condition[s], (1) the boundary behaves in a nonbrittle manner and (2) the probability of rapidly propagating fracture
is minimized. 
10 CFR 50 Appendix G, ``Fracture Toughness Requirements,'' requires that the effects of changes in the fracture toughness
of reactor vessel materials caused by neutron radiation throughout the service life of [a] nuclear reactor be considered
in the pressure-temperature limits. The change is used in conjunction with the material initial reference temperature
(RT

NDT

) to establish the limiting pressure-temperature curves. Regulatory Guide 1.99, Rev. 2, contains procedures for
calculating the effects of neutron radiation embrittlement of the low-alloy steels currently used for light-water-cooled
reactor vessels. 
Using the Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, Braidwood Unit 1 Surveillance Capsule U results, and Appendix G to 10
CFR 50, new Pressure-Temperature curves [were] prepared for the projected reactor vessel exposure at 32 EFPY of operation.
These new curves, in conjunction with the heatup and cooldown ranges and the revised Low-Temperature Overpressure
Protection System setpoints, provide the required assurance that the reactor pressure vessel is protected from
brittle fracture up 32 EFPY of operation. No changes to the design of the facility have been made and no new equipment
has been added or removed. The revised analysis and resultant adjustment of the operating limitations provide assurance
that the Reactor Coolant System is protected from brittle fracture. 
Revising the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program Withdrawal Schedule does not result in the addition or
removal of any equipment, or any design changes to the facility. Capsule lead times are revised and, for Braidwood
Unit 2, Capsule X will be removed next vice Capsule W. The proposed removal schedules remain consistent with ASTM 185-82.

Therefore, the proposed amendment to the pressure temperature limitations does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
B. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The use of the new pressure-temperature operating limits and the 
new low temperature overpressure protection curve does not change 
any postulated accident scenarios. The new curves do not 
represent any appreciable change in the current methodologies; 
they merely provide assurance that the Reactor Coolant System is 
protected from brittle fracture. No new accident or malfunction 
mechanism is introduced by the amendment and no physical plant 
changes will result from this amendment. 
Revision of the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance Program 
Withdrawal Schedule does not introduce a new accident or 
malfunction mechanism. Capsule lead times are revised, and, 
other than changing the order of specimen removal, consistent 
with ASME 185-82, no physical plant changes will result from this 
revised schedule. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new 
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
C. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 
The new pressure-temperature operating limits low temperature 
overpressure protection curves were generated with the currently 
accepted conservative methodology using capsule surveillance 
data. The new pressure-temperature curves were developed using 
industry standards and regulations (ASME Code Section III, and 
NRC Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2) which are recognized as 
being inherently conservative. The use of the new pressure- 
temperature operating limits and low temperature overpressure 
protection limits would not change postulated accident scenarios. 
The proposed revision to the Reactor Vessel Material Surveillance 
Program Withdrawal Schedule would not change postulated accident 
scenarios. Capsule lead times are revised, and, other than 
changing the order of specimen removal, consistent with ASTM 185- 
82, no physical plant changes will result from this revised 
schedule. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 March 31, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would change the 
Technical Specifications (TS) to provide allowable outage times for 
automatic actuation channel surveillance testing and restoration time for 
an inoperable engineered safety feature actuation system automatic 
actuation channel. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
The following evaluation is provided for the three categories of the 
significant hazards consideration standards: 
a. Proposed changes to allow 8 hours for master relay and logic 
testing, 12 hours for slave relay testing and 6 hours to restore 
an inoperable ESFAS Automatic Actuation Channel prior to entering 
the shutdown action clock. 
(1) The determination that these changes are within all 
acceptable criteria was established in the NRC's SER 
prepared for WCAP-10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The 
Technical Specification changes proposed by this license 
amendment request conform to NRC guidance contained in the 
SER. The NRC found that implementation of the proposed 
changes is expected to result in a small and acceptable 
increase in ESFAS unavailability. This increase in 
probability results in a small increase in calculated core 
damage frequency and public risk. The calculated increase 
in core damage frequency was judged to be acceptable since 
the increase was small and well within the range of 
uncertainty associated with the analysis. The values 
presented in WCAP-10271 Supplement 2 Revision 1 for increase 
in core damage frequency were verified by Brookhaven 
National Laboratory as part of an audit and sensitivity 
analyses performed for the NRC Staff. 
Based on the small increase in core damage frequency as 
compared with the range of uncertainty in the analysis, the 
NRC agreed that the calculated increase is acceptable. This 
conclusion was documented in the NRC's SER dated February 
22, 1989. The applicability of these conclusions has been 
verified through a plant specific review of the generic 
analysis in WCAP-10271, Supplement 2, Revision 1. The ESFAS 
Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration 
times included in this license amendment request are 
consistent with the generic analysis. In addition, the NRC 
stated that the majority of the increase in unavailability 
was due to the decrease in frequency of surveillance testing 
vice the changes in allowed outage and restoration times. 
Therefore, considering the above information, the proposed 
allowed outage and restoration time changes do not involve a 
significant increase in the probability of occurrence or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
(2) The proposed changes do not involve the physical alteration 
of any plant system and do not result in a change in the 
manner in which the ESFAS system performs its function. The 
increases in allowed outage and restoration times only 
affects the probability of the ESFAS Automatic Actuation 
Channel functioning properly as described above. Therefore, 
the allowed outage and restoration time changes proposed in 
this license amendment request do not create a new or 
different type of accident from any previously evaluated. 
(3) The proposed allowed outage time and restoration time 
changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, 
limiting safety system setpoints or limiting conditions for 
operation are determined. The impact of the revised ESFAS 
Automatic Actuation Channel allowed outage and restoration 
times is addressed above. Implementation of the proposed 
changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in 
safety by allowing adequate time for required ESFAS testing 
and quality repairs leading to improved equipment 
reliability due to a more appropriate restoration time. 
Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed allowed 
outage and restoration time changes do not involve a 
significant reduction in margin of safety. 
b. Proposed change to the minimum required degree of redundancy for 
the High-High Containment Pressure channels in Table 3.4-1. 
(1) Changing the minimum required degree of redundancy in Table 
3.4-1 for the High-High Containment Pressure Channels (Table 
3.4-1 items II.3, III.B.3, and IV.3) provides consistency 
with Technical Specification 3.4.2.c which allows an 
inoperable High-High Containment Pressure channel to be 
placed in bypass. Placement of an inoperable High-High 
Containment Pressure Channel in bypass is preferred to 
reduce the probability of an inadvertent containment spray 
event. Also, these channels are designed with a two out of 
four logic so that the failed channel may be bypassed rather 
than tripped. With the failed channel bypassed, single 
failure criterion is still met because the logic is now a 
two out of three. Furthermore, with the one channel 
bypassed, a single channel failure will not inadvertently 
initiate a containment spray. Therefore, this change can be 
considered an administrative change to correct Table 3.4-1 
to agree with the Action requirements of Technical 
Specification 3.4.2.c. As such this proposed change does 
not involve an increase in the probability of occurrence or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
(2) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in 
Table 3.4-1 for the High-High Containment Pressure channels 
is an administrative change which does not involve the 
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
in a change in the manner in which the ESFAS system performs 
its function. Therefore, the proposed correction to Table 
3.4-1 does not create the possibility of a new or different 
kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
(3) Correcting the minimum required degree of redundancy in 
Table 3.4-1 to be consistent with the Actions of Technical 
Specification 3.4.2.c is an administrative change and as 
such does not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. 
c. Proposed change to the delete footnote +++ from Table 3.4-1. 
(1) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4-1 removes the 
inconsistency between it and Technical Specification 3.4.2.c 
which states that channels other than the High-High 
Containment Pressure channels shall be placed in trip during 
testing. The change does not affect the manner in which 
ESFAS provides plant protection. In addition the change 
does not affect the functioning of ESFAS or the way Zion 
Station conducts channel testing. Instrument channel 
testing will continue to be conducted in the tripped mode 
with the exception of the High-High Containment Pressure 
channels, which can be tested in bypass because of the risk 
of a spurious Containment Spray event. Automatic Actuation 
Channel testing will be performed in accordance with the 
allowed outage times of new Specification 3.4.2.d. As such 
this proposed change does not involve any significant 
increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of 
an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4-1 does not involve the 
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
in a change in the manner in which ESFAS performs its 
function. Therefore this change does not involve the 
physical alteration of any plant system and does not result 
in a change in the manner in which the ESFAS system performs 
its function. Therefore, the proposed correction to Table 
3.4-1 does not create the possibility of a new or different 
kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
(3) Deleting footnote +++ from Table 3.4-1 does not alter the 
manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system 
setpoints or limiting conditions for operation are 
determined. Implementation of this change will not alter 
ESFAS testing. Therefore implementation of this change does 
not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. 
d. Proposed editorial change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.c. 
The editorial change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.c to change 
``Containment Hi-Hi pressure channels'' to ``High-High Containment 
Pressure channels'' is purely an administrative change which has 
no affect on plant safety. 
e. Summary. 
The foregoing analyses demonstrate that the proposed License 
Amendment to the Zion Station Technical Specifications does not 
involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence 
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident, does not 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and 
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Consumers Power Company, Docket No. 50-155, Big Rock Point Plant, 
Charlevoix County, Michigan 




Date of amendment request:

 April 22, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed change revises the reactor 
vessel pressure-temperature limits in the Technical Specifications. The 
change insures that the vessel fracture toughness requirements of Section V 
of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, are satisfied through the end of life. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
1. Will the proposed change involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated? 
The margin above Nil Ductility Transition Temperature (NDTT) is 
governed by 10 CFR 50 Appendix G and remains unchanged. The 
proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
2. Will the proposed change create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated? 
The predicted shifts in NDTT are based on a revised reference 
temperature consistent with Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2, 
dated May 1988. This method of revising temperature-pressure 
limits is the same as in the past (ASME Code Section III, 
Appendix G). 
3. Will the proposed change involve a significant reduction in the 
margin of safety? 
The proposed curves were generated for an End of Licensed Life 
(May 31, 2000) Effective Full Power Year exposure and are 
conservative in nature until that time. The margin of safety 
[is] unchanged. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 April 18, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 License Amendment No. 81, issued on 
July 15, 1993, changed the numbering of surveillance requirements for 
Technical Specifications 3/4.3.1, ``Control Rod Operability,'' 3/4.3.2, 
``Control Rod Maximum Scram,'' and 3/4.10.2, ``Rod Pattern Control System.'' 
However, Action Statements referencing these surveillance requirements were 
overlooked and were not appropriately renumbered. The purpose of the 
proposed technical specification change would be to renumber the overlooked 
references. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration which is presented below: 
(1) These changes do not affect the intent or implementation of the 
applicable Technical Specifications. The changes simply make the 
affected Technical Specifications consistent. Since these are 
only editorial changes which do not impact the plant design or 
operations, they cannot increase the probability or the 
consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

(2) The proposed changes are editorial only and do not affect the 
plant design or operation. No new failure modes are introduced 
by such changes and, therefore, the request will not create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
accident previously evaluated. 

(3) The proposed changes merely correct an editorial oversight. 
These changes do not alter or delete any technical requirements 
and, therefore, do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 18, 1994. 



Description of amendment request: 

Test methods for carbon adsorber filters 
specified in Technical Specification Sections 3/4.6.6.3, ``Standby Gas 
Treatment System,'' and 3/4.7.2, ``Control Room Ventilation System,'' specify 
the 1979 version of ASTM D3803. The proposed change would delete the year 
of the standard so that more recent versions of the standard could be used. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As 

required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below: 

(1) The proposed changes to the Technical Specification surveillance 
requirements for determining the methyl iodide penetration of 
carbon samples would not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or the consequences of any accident previously 
evaluated because the proposed change merely allows Illinois 
Power (IP) to utilize a more up-to-date version of the same test 
method currently specified. More recent versions of the test 
method are more effective at detecting unsatisfactory charcoal 
performance because they include equilibration periods to ensure 
that all samples have a common starting point before being 
challenged with radioactive gas. The proposed change would not 
affect the quality of the charcoal or the reliability of the 
filter subsystems as it only relates to testing and involves no 
changes to the design or operation of the ventilation subsystems 
themselves. The updated standards provide more accurate and 
repeatable test results and do not change the properties or 
acceptance criteria for these properties. As a result, the 
performance capabilities of the associated filter subsystems 
would not be adversely impacted by the proposed change. 

(2) The proposed change would not involve a change in the design or 
operation of any plant system or component. In addition, the 
proposed change would not reduce the level of filter train 
subsystem reliability nor would it create an initiating event for 
any accident. Because the performance, function, and redundancy 
of the original design remain unchanged, the proposed change 
would not create the potential for a new event. Furthermore, 
since no new types of equipment would be introduced into the 
plant design and the proposed change would not adversely impact 
existing equipment, no potential for a different type of 
malfunction is created by the proposed change. Therefore, this 
proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. 

(3) The margin of safety for the charcoal filter subsystems as 
defined in the Bases to the Technical Specifications associated 
with the proposed change refers to the ability of the filters to 
remove radioiodines. The proposed change would allow IP to 
upgrade the currently specified test for determining charcoal 
adsorber performance with one which utilizes the same type of 
methodology, but provides greater accuracy and repeatability. 
The newer versions of the test method are more effective at 
detecting unsatisfactory charcoal performance because they 
include equilibration periods to ensure that all samples have a 
common starting point before being challenged with radioactive 
gas. Thus, the proposed change would not involve a reduction in 
the margin of safety.

Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear 
Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota 





Date of amendment request: 

March 28, 1994. 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise 
technical specifications Tables 3.2.4 and 4.2.1, to change one of the 
initiating parameters of the reactor building ventilation isolation system 
and standby gas treatment system (SGTS) from Low Reactor Water Level to Low 
Low Reactor Water Level. This revision is being made in order to improve 
plant performance by reducing the potential for unnecessary secondary 
containment isolation and SGTS initiations. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The function of the Standby Gas Treatment System and secondary 
containment is to mitigate the consequences of a loss of coolant 
accident and fuel handling accidents. The proposed changes maintain 
this capability. The revised Standby Gas Treatment System initiation 
and secondary containment isolation parameter of low low reactor water 
level provides the required detection of loss of coolant accidents and 
is consistent [with] ECCS actuation to mitigate the consequences of 
this accident. The low low reactor water level instrumentation is set 
to trip when reactor water level is 6'6'' above the top of the active 
fuel. This trip currently initiates closure of the Group 1 Primary 
containment isolation valves, activates the Emergency Core Cooling 
systems and starts the emergency diesel generator. This trip setting 
level was chosen to be low enough to prevent spurious operation but 
high enough to initiate Emergency Core Cooling system operation and 
primary system isolation so that no melting of the fuel cladding will 
occur, post accident cooling can be accomplished, and the guidelines 
of the 10 CFR 100 will not be violated. Therefore, this amendment 
will not cause a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello 
plant. 

The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications for the standby gas 
treatment system and secondary containment do not alter the function 
8 of the systems or its interrelationships with other systems. An 
adverse interaction which could be postulated to occur is the 
initiation of the Standby Gas Treatment System without a coordinated 
trip of the Mechanical Vacuum Pump. The Mechanical Vacuum Pump is 
operated during plant startups to draw a vacuum on the main condenser 
prior to admission of steam. The Mechanical vacuum discharges to the 
offgas stack and thus can create a back pressure on the Standby Gas 
Treatment System, reducing initiation of Standby Gas Treatment System 
flow below required values. The proposed initiation of Standby Gas 
Treatment System on low low reactor water level maintains the 
necessary coordination by having the Standby Gas Treatment System 
initiate subsequent to isolation or tripping of the Mechanical Vacuum 
Pump on a low reactor water level signal from the primary containment 
isolation logic. Therefore, this amendment will not create the 
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident 
previously analyzed. 

The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the 
margin of safety. 

The proposed amendment changes the initiation of the Standby Gas 
Treatment System and secondary containment isolation from being 
concurrent with the low reactor water signal (which is indicative that 
the reactor core is in danger of being inadequately cooled) to being 
concurrent with reactor low low water level (which is also an 
indicator that the capability to cool the core is threatened and 
assures that no melting of the fuel cladding will occur, post accident 
cooling can be accomplished, and the guidelines of 10 CFR 100 will not 
be violated). A review of the accident analyses provided in Section 
14 of the USAR has determined that these analyses did not specifically 
credit initiation of the Standby Gas Treatment Systems and secondary 
containment isolation at the accident precursor reactor water level of 
low level. Furthermore, this review determined that the low low 
reactor water level setpoint has no adverse impact on the ability of 
the Standby Gas treatment System and secondary containment to perform 
its design basis function as credited in the accident analyses. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed modification to Technical Specification (TS) Sections 3.11.1.4, 6.9.1.8, and 6.14.1 would change
the frequency for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to
annually.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes simply involve revising the frequency
for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually in order
to implement the amended reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a as promulgated in Final Rule 57 FR 39353. Since the
information contained in this report is reviewed and evaluated after the effluents are released, no accidents previously
evaluated are impacted by the proposed TS changes. Radiological effluent releases from the station will continue
to be controlled as required by the TS, including those requirements specified in the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual
(ODCM) and Process Control Program (PCP). The proposed TS changes do not involve any changes to the operation or physical
configuration of any plant systems or equipment. The proposed changes do not impact any initial or final accident
conditions or assumptions previously evaluated. The radiological consequences of these previously evaluated
accidents are not affected by the proposed changes.

Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature. The proposed changes simply involve revising the frequency
for submitting the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually in order
to implement the amended reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.36a as promulgated in Final Rule 57 FR 39353. Radiological
effluent releases from the station will continue to be controlled as required by the TS, including those requirements
specified in the ODCM and PCP. The proposed TS changes do not involve any modifications to plant systems or equipment.

Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed TS changes are administrative in nature, and will only involve revising the frequency for submitting
the Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report to the NRC from semiannually to annually as currently stipulated
in 10 CFR 50.36a. The specific radiological effluent release information contained in this report will continue
to be provided as required. The station radiological effluent releases will continue to be controlled as required
by TS, including those requirements specified in the ODCM and PCP.

Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes would permit the submittal of the Radioactive Effluents Release
Report on an annual rather than a semiannual basis; allow changes to the Offsite Dose Calculation Manual (ODCM) to
be submitted in the Radioactive Effluent Release Report rather than in the monthly operating report; remove the title

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the administrative change does not affect plant operations in any manner.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated
because the proposed change is administrative in nature and no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes
to setpoints or operating parameters are proposed.

3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The change is only
administrative.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 11, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes would delete surveillance requirement 4.8.1.4.a.3, which requires
periodic testing of penetration protection fuses, and its associated Basis.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased.

Fuses are simple protection devices and can only degrade by being more resistive which is in the conservative direction.
The proper type and size fuse is assured as part of design, procurement, and initial installation. The testing provides
no additional assurance of operability. Therefore, the deletion of periodic retesting of these fuses will not increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. [The proposed amendment will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.

The design of the penetration protection and the installation of the fuses has not changed in any way. Any undetected
failure of a fuse would fall under single failure criteria. A current limiting fuse must have high electrical current
in order to perform its intended function. Any fuse which has opened the circuit through the penetration would be detected.
(This is not a concern of the Technical Specifications.) Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Deletion of this surveillance requirement will not minimize
the intent of this Technical Specification. This TS is to assure continued operability of the containment penetration
conductor overcurrent protection which helps to ensure containment integrity. Testing, however, may introduce
the potential for damage to the fuses and fuse clips. Therefore, the deletion of this TS requirement will not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and based on this review it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, 
Duquesne Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, 
Toledo Edison Company, Docket No. 50-440, Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 
No. 1, Lake County, Ohio 





Date of amendment request: 

November 22, 1993. 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would result in 
the replacement of most of the analog Riley temperature instrumentation 
associated with leak detection with digital equipment from the General 
Electric Company NUMAC product line. Technical Specification changes would 
be made to instrumentation surveillance requirements for temperature 
instruments associated with main steam line isolation, reactor water 
cleanup system isolation, reactor core isolation cooling system isolation, 
and residual heat removal system isolation. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The Technical specifications are proposed to be revised to 
perform a Channel Functional Test on a semiannual frequency 
versus the current monthly frequency for both ambient and 
differential temperature and for the MSL tunnel temperature timer 
functions, for the above listed piping lines. Additionally, this 
evaluation addressees the potential for, and implications of, 
common mode failures due to software, hardware and/or 
electromagnetic and radio-frequency interference (EMI/RFI). 

The NUMAC instrumentation has certain design features which 
contribute to its reliability. The replacement NUMAC LDMs are 
digital instruments that use a microcomputer to monitor the 
ambient and differential temperatures (also the MSL tunnel 
temperature timer) and provide outputs and automatic self-testing 
and calibration. A description of the major design features 
include: a) isolation of the essential microcomputer by a serial 
data link from the front panel display (and display 
microcomputer), b) a self-test system feature that provides 
automatic testing of internal circuits and reports failures, c) 
thermocouple failure detection, d) provisions to test the output 
relays without the use of jumpers (reducing the threat of 
spurious isolation), and e) two independent built-in instrument 
power supplies (that automatically switchover to the other supply 
in the event of failure). Also, several features have been 
included, among these, a) a hardware ``watchdog'' timer to monitor 
against software cycling in continuous loops, and b) software 
structured with the safety-related essential tasks running at the 
highest priority in the system. These capabilities increase the 
reliability of the collected data, reduce the possibility of 
inadvertent isolation and plant shutdowns, reduce the need for 
frequent calibrations, and reduce the likelihood of common mode 
failures. 

The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will maintain the same 
environmental and electrical physical independence criteria 
(qualifications) as the existing Leak Detection System 
components. The LDMs, the associated thermocouple input units 
(TCIUs), and relay output units (ROUs) will be mounted 
seismically such that qualification of these components and the 
Control Room panels will be maintained. The LDMs are qualified 
for the PNPP Control Room environment. The LDMs (one per 
division) will be physically and electrically independent of each 
other and do not share power supplies, thermocouple inputs, 
output relays, microcomputer logic units, display units or 
enclosures and mounting locations. A postulated gross failure of 
any one NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of the input unit, 
microcomputer logic unit or the relay output unit, will not 
propagate to the other NUMAC LDM, such as gross malfunction of 
the input unit, microcomputer logic unit or the relay output 
unit, will not propagate to the other NUMAC LDM. Thus, a failure 
within one NUMAC LDM will not prevent or disable the function of 
the other NUMAC LDM. A failure within one NUMAC LDM may cause 
the loss of one division of the isolation trip logic. However, 
since the other redundant division (the MSLs have three other 
divisions) will not be affected by this failure, the Leak 
Detection System will still be able to perform its designed 
safety-related function and provide the necessary system 
isolation. This is the same as the current Leak Detection System 
design basis. 

The possibility of a common mode failure of both NUMAC LDM 
divisions is minimized by the design of the NUMAC hardware and 
software, the verification and validation (V&V) of the software 
to reduce the likelihood of errors, the testing of the software 
(to discover and eliminate errors), and the design of and testing 
of the hardware to demonstrate its resistance to EMI/RFI. The 
NUMAC instrument design features, by effectively eliminating the 
potential for common mode failures, maintain the Leak Detection 
System within its current licensing basis. (A discussion of 
common mode failure protection is presented in more detail in the 
answer to question two.) Therefore, the design, isolation and 
separation criteria remain the same. 

Additionally, as described within Chapter 7 of the Updated Safety 
Analysis Report (USAR), diversity is provided to the ambient and 
differential temperature monitoring trip functions for the 
various systems by alternative leak detection methods (such as 
measuring steam line flow or pressure) that provide backup in the 
event of the loss of both divisions of the NUMAC Leak Detection 
Monitors. These alternative leak detection methods are 
physically separate from those being performed by the NUMAC LDM 
and constitute a diverse, redundant, safety related backup 
capable of responding to a design basis line break for the 
various systems. Therefore, a common mode failure of both LDM 
divisions would not prevent any of the necessary system isolation 
from occurring. 

No changes are being made to the isolation logic of the Leak 
Detection System. No accident initiators or precursors are 
affected by the proposed changes to the Channel Functional Test 
surveillance intervals for the various trip functions. One 
purpose of a Channel Functional Test is to check the instrument 
setpoints. The NUMAC instrument setpoints are set digitally and 
do not drift. An engineering evaluation has established that the 
Channel Functional Test surveillance interval can be extended 
from one to six months. The potential for common mode failures 
has been accounted for in the design and measures have been taken 
to lower the probability of this to an acceptable level (see the 
answer to question two). Also, alternative leak detection 
methods exist for this eventuality. Since the NUMAC Leak 
Detection Monitoring equipment meets or exceeds the design and 
licensing criteria specified for the Leak Detection System, the 
proposed upgrade cannot increase the probability of occurrence of 
any accident previously evaluated. 

A portion of the Leak Detection System logic causes a closure of 
the Main Steam Isolation Valves on a steam leak signal. This 
transient, described in Chapter 15 of the USAR, may also occur 
due to a LDS equipment malfunction. Since this modification 
replaces some of the existing Riley temperature monitoring 
instrumentation with more reliable instrumentation the 
probability of this transient is reduced (no radiological 
consequences are associated with this event). The LDS is also 
used to mitigate the consequences of a pipe break outside primary 
containment by isolating the affected system connected to the 
Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary (RCPB). The replacement of the 
Riley instrumentation with NUMAC LDMs will not change, degrade, 
or prevent the Leak Detection System response to mitigate the 
radiological consequences of an accident. Therefore, replacement 
of the Riley temperature modules with NUMAC Leak Detection 
Monitors will not significantly increase the consequences of any 
accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated.

The single failure criterion requires that any single failure 
within a safety-related system not prevent proper protective 
action of the overall system when the system is required to 
function. The Leak Detection System design is such that a 
failure of one division will not prevent the system from 
performing its safety function. Common mode failure protection 
provisions have been addressed in the NUMAC LDM design. 

The comprehensive General Electric software V&V and configuration 
management control programs minimize, although they cannot 
entirely eliminate, the likelihood of a common mode NUMAC 
instrument failure due to software problems. The hardware 
(firmware) and software for the PNPP NUMAC Leak Detection 
Monitors will undergo a formal software verification and 
validation (V&V) process by General Electric, that is to be 
completed by the end of the year, equivalent to the one reviewed 
and approved by the NRC for the safety-related Wide Range Neutron 
Monitor. 

The NUMAC instruments are designed to minimize both their 
susceptibility to, and generation of, electromagnetic and radio-
frequency interference (EMI/RFI) to prevent spurious operations 
and allow their use in safety-related systems. As part of a 
broader plan by GE to improve the testing has been performed by 
GE on the Leak Detection Monitor configuration in order to both 
expand the overall qualification region, and to obtain test data 
specific to this application. This testing ensures the 
qualification of the Thermocouple Input Unit (TCIU), a NUMAC 
circuit board which is unique to the LDM application, and also 
extends the NUMAC EMI/RFI qualification region to include both 
higher and lower frequencies than previously tested. 

The NUMAC instrument design concept has undergone review by the 
NRC, and the initial instruments of the NUMAC product line (the 
Logarithmic Radiation Monitor and Wide Range Neutron Monitoring 
System) have received NRC approval via Safety Evaluation of the 
associated GE Licensing Topical Reports. The various types of 
NUMAC equipment in operation at other nuclear power plants have 
components and software modules which are similar to and in some 
instance identical to the NUMAC LDMs. Therefore, based on the 
NRC reviewed and approved NUMAC software and hardware control 
programs instituted by GE, the design features to minimize 
software/hardware (or their interface) problems, design features 
to minimize susceptibility to EMI/RFI, and testing to demonstrate 
resistance to EMI/RFI, installation of NUMAC Leak Detection 
Monitors at the PNPP does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 

The replacement of the analog Riley temperature modules with the 
microcomputer based NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors will not affect 
any design conditions or impact the margins of safety for the 
various Leak Detection System monitored parameters in the 
Technical Specification Table 3.3.2-2 will not be changed or 
affected by this modification. Only the CHANNEL FUNCTIONAL test 
interval is being extended. 

The NUMAC Leak Detection Monitor design, with the attention paid 
towards minimizing the potential for, and the effect of, 
software/hardware and/or EMI/RFI related problem or common mode 
failures and resulting operational experience has demonstrated 
that replacement of the existing Riley temperature modules with 
NUMAC Leak Detection Monitors would not result in a significant 
reduction in the margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, Nuclear Project 
No. 2, Benton County, Washington 





Date of amendment request: 

February 8, 1994, as supplemented 
March 25, 1994. 



Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would revise the WNP-2 
Technical Specifications. Specifically, the amendment would increase the 
stroke time, as specified in Table 3.6.3-1, for reactor core isolation 
cooling (RCIC) valve RCIC-V-8, from 13 seconds to 26 seconds and the note 
(j) reference would be deleted from RCIC-V-8 and RCIC-V-63. The note (j) 
indicates that the stroke time specified in the Table reflects the 
requirement for containment isolation only. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

1. This proposed action does not involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated. RCIC-V-8 and V-63 are containment isolation valves 
and are normally open. Failure of the valves to open or close 
cannot cause an accident. The mitigating capability of 
RCIC-V-8 and V-63 is not changed in that the valves will continue 
to be closed within the established time limits. This ensures 
protection of the safety related equipment necessary for 
continued compliance with the requirements of General Design 
Criterion 4. In those accidents which involve a source term and 
potential adverse dose release consequences, no credit is taken 
for the closing of the valves; therefore the increase in the 
allowable time for closing does not increase the consequences of 
those accidents. 

2. This proposed action does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. The requested Technical Specifications change does 
not represent a change in modes of operation. It does not, in 
itself, require physical modification to the plant, although it 
will be used to allow a gear change in RCIC-MO-8. The new gears 
represent a standard configuration for Limitorque motor operators 
and will require a routine design change. The required Technical 
Specification change maintains the licensing basis for the plant 
as discussed in response to question 1. Hence, no new or 
different kind of accident is possible as a result of 
implementing this change. 

3. This proposed action does not involve a significant reduction in 
a margin of safety. The increase in stroke time will increase 
the peak temperature in the HELB profiles and thereby decrease 
the margin available from the equipment qualification limits. 
However, sufficient margin remains to assure the equipment 
operability is maintained and there is no reduction in the margin 
of safety. Additionally, there is no reduction in the margin of 
safety because increasing the stroke time will not change the 
postulated radiological releases.

<DOCTITLE>Ledoux and Co., Teaneck, NJ; Order Suspending Licenses</DOCTITLE>



I



Ledoux and Company (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct, Source Material, and Special Nuclear Material Licenses
Nos. 29-01442-01, SMC-1181, and SNM-296 (Licenses), respectively, issued by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70.

Byproduct material License No. 29-01442-01 authorizes the Licensee to possess byproduct material for
use in the analysis of fission products and neutron-induced radionuclides in various materials, and to possess byproduct
material to be used in the calibration of radioassay equipment, including the development of analytical chemical
procedures. Byproduct material License No. 29-01442-01 was originally issued on November 20, 1956,
was most recently renewed on March 8, 1989, and was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant
to 10 CFR 30.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February
24, 1994.

Source Material License No. SMC-1181 authorizes the Licensee to possess source material for analysis of samples
and preparation and use of working standards.

Source Material License No. SMC-1181 was originally issued on December 14, 1973, was most recently renewed
on January 10, 1991, and is due to expire on January 31, 1996.

Special Nuclear Material License No. SNM-296 authorizes the Licensee to possess plutonium and uranium-235
for use in laboratory sample analysis and calibration of instruments. Special Nuclear Material License SNM-296
was originally issued on April 1, 1959. This license was most recently renewed on March 13, 1989, and was due to expire
on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect pursuant to 10 CFR 303.37 and a timely request for renewal by the Licensee
in accordance with a Licensee letter dated February 24, 1994.



II



As of July 27, 1990, the Licensee was required to comply with the regulations set forth in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36,
and 10 CFR 70.25. These regulations require that licensees authorized to possess licensed material in the amounts
listed in the above-listed Licenses, must submit a certification of financial assurance or a decommissioning funding
plan to the NRC. These regulations have been established to assure that licensees demonstrate adequate financial
responsibility that funds necessary for a safe decommissioning are available and planned, thus providing adequate
assurance that the facility will be decommissioned prior to terminating licensed activities.

On August 18, 1992, the NRC issued a Demand for Information to the Licensee since the NRC had not, as of that date, received
financial assurance from the Licensee. The Demand for Information was issued to determine whether the Licenses should
be modified, suspended or revoked. NRC sent letters dated October 21, 1992, and November 16, 1993 to the Licensee,
and telephone conversations were held with the Licensee on September 28, 1990, January 13, 1992, December 14, 1993,
and January 5, 1994, emphasizing the importance of providing the NRC the required financial assurance. Furthermore,
an NRC inspection was conducted on October 18-19, 1993 (during which the Licensee committed to provide the required
financial assurance by the end of 1993), and an enforcement conference was held with the Licensee on March 15, 1994,
to emphasize the significance with which the NRC viewed the failure to provide financial assurance.

In response to the NRC Demand for Information, dated August 18, 1992, Ledoux and Company provided, by letter dated
September 10, 1992, a decommissioning cost estimate of $113,013. However, a financial assurance mechanism to cover
the estimated amount was not provided. On November 5, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it intended
to establish an escrow account in the amount of $125,000 as its financial assurance mechanism by January 1, 1994. On
December 28, 1993, the Licensee informed the NRC by letter that it needed more time to provide a suitable financial
assurance mechanism due to unforeseen circumstances. During the enforcement conference on March 15, 1994, Ledoux
and Company representatives indicated that a financial assurance mechanism would not be provided in the next month.
On April 5, 1994, the Licensee stated in a letter that it was planning to provide 2 ``letters of credit * * *''
and that it would need some time. However, to date no financial assurance mechanism has been provided to the NRC.

III 


As described in Section I, the Licensee is authorized to receive, possess, use, and transfer a wide range of byproduct
material, special nuclear material, and source material in quantities set forth in its Licenses. The regulations
specified in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25 require licensees to provide financial assurance such that
licensed facilities will be decommissioned in a safe and timely manner, and that adequate funds will be available
for decommissioning to ensure that the health and safety of the public is protected. The Licensee has continually
failed to provide to the NRC the required financial assurance contrary to the requirements in 10 CFR 30.35, 10 CFR 40.36,
and 10 CFR 70.25, yet continues to perform NRC-licensed activities. The Licensee is either unwilling or unable to
comply with the financial assurance requirements. The public health and safety require the Licensee to have adequate
funds and financial assurance for decommissioning to ensure that decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities
can be completed in a safe and timely manner. 

Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that sufficient funding will be available for decommissioning
of the facility in compliance with Commission requirements, and that the health and safety of the public, including
the Licensee's employees, will be protected in connection with the decommissioning of the Licensee's facilities.
This is significant should the Licensee discontinue operations without appropriate financial assurance for the
decommissioning. Therefore, the public health, safety, and interest require that License Nos. 29-01442-01,
SMC-1181, and SNM-296 be suspended. 



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 51, 62, 63, 81, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR parts 30, 40, and 70, it is hereby ordered that License Nos.
29-01442-01, SMC-1181, and SWM-296, are suspended pending the submittal to NRC by the licensee
of appropriate financial assurance in the amount of $125,000.00 for its licensees in accordance with 10 CFR 30.35,
10 CFR 40.36, and 10 CFR 70.25, and the NRC's written acceptance of the licensee's submittal(s) to satisfy these regulatory
requirements. While the Licenses are suspended, the Licensee shall not receive, use, manufacture, distribute,
or transfer radioactice material and shall place all licensed material in locked storage.

The Regional Administrator, Region I, may, in writing, relax or rescind this Order upon demonstrator by the Licensee
of good cause. 



V



In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, the Licensee must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may
consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents of this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmiation,
specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and set forth the matters of fact and law on which
the Licensee or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued.


Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN:
Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of the hearing request also should be sent to the
Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General
Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale
Road, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, 19406, and to the Licensee if the hearing request is by a person other than the
Licensee. If a person other than the Licensee requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the
manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).

If a hearing is requested by the Licensee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
on Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained. 

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-21 issued to Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of its Nuclear
Project No. 2 (WNP-2) plant, located in Benton County, Washington.

The proposed amendment changes the plant operating license to rename three primary containment isolation check
valves listed in the technical specifications. The licensee is making an administrative change to rename valve PI-EFC-X29d
to make its number consistent with other similar valves in the technical specifications. The license is renaming
excess flow check valves PI-EFCX-72f and PI-EFCX-73e because they are replacing them with
swing check valves that have a different numbering nomenclature.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the license
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

The Supply System has evaluated the proposed changes against the above standards as required by 10 CFR 50.91(a) and
concluded that the change does not:

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated:

Revising the equipment piece number (EPN) for PI-EFC-X29d to PI-EFC-X29b in Technical Specification
Table 3.6.3-1 is an administrative change and provides consistency between the Technical Specifications
and approved design bases. PI-EFC-X29d provides instrument line break (ILB) mitigation as analyzed
in FSAR Section 15.6.2. Renaming PI-EFC-X29d has no impact on FSAR accident analyses.

Replacing existing excess flow check valves PI-EFCX-72f and PI-EFCX-73e with swing check
valves and changing the EPNs has no impact on the containment isolation design basis described in FSAR Section 6.2.4.3.2.2.3.3.
This plant modification will conform the plant to the FSAR design basis. The FSAR describes the drywell and suppression
chamber air sampling lines and indicates that ``the return lines are equipped with * * * a reverse-oriented
excess flow check valve used as a simple check valve inside of containment.'' Replacement of the spring loaded excess
flow check valve with a simple check valve (without a spring) meets plant design bases and 10CFR50 Appendix A, General
Design Criterion (GDC) 56 criteria for containment isolation. The valve change and resulting EPN change do not impact
the FSAR design analyses.

Therefore, this change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated:

No new mode of operation of any equipment results from the valve design change or EPN change for the three excess flow
check valves. Renaming valve PI-EFC-X29d is an administrative change.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940512-2-00145 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The replacement, and subsequent EPN change, of inboard containment isolation excess flow check valves PI-EFCX-72f
and PI-EFCX-73e with swing check valves brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases.
Operation and maintenance of these valves in accordance with design and Technical Specification requirements provide
assurance that primary containment will be maintained for the design basis LOCA event. The EPN change is required
to conform to standard nomenclature for identification of penetration isolation valves.

Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:

The administrative name change for PI-EFC-X29d is made to ensure consistency between Technical Specification
Table 3.6.3-1 and existing plant design documentation. Renaming this excess flow check valve provides consistency
to the nomenclature of other excess flow check valves which use a dual tube method of draining condensate.

The replacement and subsequent EPN change of inboard containment isolation valves PI-EFCX-72f and PI-EFCX-73e
brings the plant into conformance with the analyzed design bases. Maintenance and operation requirements are not
modified in any manner. Adherence to the analyzed design bases will not affect the margin of safety for the design bases
analysis.

Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

In preparing this request the Technical Specification Bases were reviewed for impact. No changes are necessary to
address the EPN changes or the replacement of two excess flow check valves with swing check valves.

Based on this review, the Supply System has determined that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Accordingly,
the Supply System has determined that this amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

The NRC reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 30-day notice period expires. However, should circumstances
change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown
of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period,
provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The
final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action,
it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By June 13, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license, and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland,
Washington 99352. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplemental to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Theodore R. Quay, Director, Project Directorate IV-3: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Winston & Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, D.C.
20005-3502, the licensee's attorney.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated May 5, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland,

Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice
of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Bond Listing
Standards


May 5, 1994.


I. Introduction


On December 22, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to revise its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities. On April 1, 1994, the
NYSE submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to clarify its interpretation
of certain provisions of the original filing.





The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33531 (January 27, 1994),
59 FR 4960 (February 2, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change,
including Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.


II. Description of the Proposal


Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual set forth the current standards for listing debt
securities of domestic and foreign issuers, respectively, on that Exchange. Under either paragraph, the NYSE uses
the following minimum criteria to determine whether a debt security is eligible to be listed: The bond issue must have
an aggregate market value or principal amount of $5 million; the anticipated distribution must be ``sufficient for
trading on the Exchange''; and the company must be in a position to cover interest charges on all debts issued by it for
a subsidiary. In this regard, the NYSE deems interest coverage to be inadequate if the interest charges on all debt
issued by the company, its parent or a subsidiary exceed earnings, before or after taxes, as reported in a filing to
the Commission.
 Finally, Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 allow the Exchange to list convertible debt only if the underlying common stock
also is listed on the NYSE.




The delisting standards for debt securities are set forth in paragraphs 801.00 and 802.00 of the Listed Company Manual.
The NYSE normally gives consideration to delisting a bond issue if the aggregate market value or principal amount
falls below $1 million, or if the company's interest coverage is deemed to be inadequate.
 The NYSE also can review the continued listing of a debt security pursuant to certain other criteria in paragraph 802.00
(

e.g.,

 ``authoritative advice received that security is without value,'' ``inability to meet current debt obligations
or to adequately finance operations''). In terms of convertible bonds, paragraph 801.00 states that it is the NYSE's
customary policy to delist a convertible security if the related common stock is delisted.




The NYSE proposes to simplify and relax its standards for the listing and delisting of debt securities, in order to
make the Exchange's trading and disclosure systems more accessible to bond issuers. Specifically, the proposed
amendments to paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05 will eliminate the requirement that the Exchange evaluate the anticipated
distribution of a bond issue,
 and will replace the current definition of adequate interest coverage with a new standard based on issuer or bond rating
status.
 In addition, the NYSE proposal will permit the Exchange to list convertible debt whenever the underlying equity security
is subject to real-time sale reporting in the United States.
 Only the requirement that the bond issues have an aggregate market value or principal amount of no less than $5 million
will remain unchanged.

<TEXT>
 

As noted above, the NYSE proposal contains a new standard for evaluating whether a debt issuer has the ability to meet
its interest obligations. Rather than using an earnings deficit, or the lack thereof, as the basis for making that
determination,
 the Exchange will rely instead on either (1) its own initial and continued listing standards for equity securities
or (2) the analysis of a nationally recognized securities rating organization (``NRSRO'').




Specifically, if an issuer of NYSE listed equity is in ``good standing'' with the Exchange,
 the NYSE normally will list that company's debt securities so long as they have an aggregate market value or principal
amount of at least $5 million. This standard also will apply to an issuer owned by, or under common control with, an issuer
of NYSE listed equity; and to an issuer whose debt securities are guaranteed by an issuer of NYSE listed equity. According
to the NYSE, because debt enjoys seniority over equity, the ``good standing'' test warrants listing an ``affiliated''
issuer's bonds.




In contrast, debt securities of an ``unaffiliated'' issuer
 will not be eligible for initial listing on the NYSE unless an NRSRO has assigned a certain minimum rating to the bonds
(or to other bonds issued by the same company). Thus, the NYSE will be able to list such a debt issue only if it has received
a rating no lower than a Standard and Poor's (``S&P'') Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent
thereof). If the issue proposed to be listed has not been rated, those bonds must be either senior to, or 

pari passu 

with,
 an issue that has received at least an S&P Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof).
Alternatively, the proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are junior to an investment
grade issue.







As under current Paragraph 802.00, the NYSE will give consideration to delisting a bond issue if its aggregate market
value or principal amount falls below $1 million, or if the issuer is unable to meet its obligations on the listed debt
securities.
 The NYSE also will retain the discretion to remove a bond from listing if, among other things, ``authoritative advice
[is] received that [the] security is without value.'' As a practical matter, the NYSE has indicated that it normally
will not delist debt where there is value in the security and continued exchange trading is in the best interests of
investors.
 The Exchange, however, has committed to give serious consideration to delisting a bond issue if the debt security
has minimal or no value and the issuer is unable to meet its financial obligations.







In addition, the NYSE will amend Paragraph 801.00 to specify that convertible bonds will be reviewed for continued
listing when the underlying equity security is delisted,
 and will be delisted when the related security is no longer subject to real-time last sale reporting in the United States.
Further, if the common stock is delisted due to a violation of the NYSE's ``corporate responsibility'' criteria (including,
but not limited to, the outside director, audit committee and shareholder voting requirements),
 then the Exchange will delist all debt securities convertible into that common stock.






Finally, the NYSE has indicated that the listing and delisting standards for ``unaffiliated'' corporate issuers
 also will apply to certain non-corporate issuers. In particular, the proposed rule change specifies that sovereign
issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The NYSE proposal also will codify the Exchange's current policy
that only term/dollar municipal bonds may be listed.






The Exchange states that the basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5)
that an exchange have rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote
just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market
and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

III. Discussion



The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
 Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules
of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.




The development and enforcement of adequate standards governing the initial and continued listing of securities
on an exchange is an activity of critical importance to financial markets and the investing public. Listing standards
serve as a means for a self-regulatory organization to screen issuers and to provide listed status only to bona fide
companies with sufficient float, investor base and trading interest to maintain fair and orderly markets. Once a
security has been approved for initial listing, maintenance criteria allow an exchange to monitor the status and
trading characteristics of that issue to ensure that it continues to meet the exchange's standards for market depth
and liquidity. For the reasons set forth below, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change will provide
the NYSE with greater flexibility in determining which debt securities warrant inclusion in its bond trading and
disclosure systems, without compromising the benefits that the Exchange's listing standards offer to investors.


After careful review, the Commission has concluded that the initial listing standards in paragraphs 102.03 (for
domestic issuers) and 103.05 (for foreign issuers), as amended, should ensure that only substantial companies capable
of meeting their financial obligations are eligible to have their bonds listed on the NYSE. As before, the proposed
rule change will require that the NYSE evaluate an issuer's ability to cover the interest charges on its debt securities.
Although the Exchange currently makes this interest coverage determination itself,
 the amended standards will rely instead on either the issuer's relationship with the NYSE or the bonds' NRSRO rating.





The Commission agrees that, to the extent the NYSE has adequate listing standards for common stock, the Exchange reasonably
may assume that NYSE listed companies (and certain affiliates thereof)
 in ``good standing'' with the Exchange
 are in solid financial condition and do not pose a significant risk of defaulting on their obligations. Moreover,
as the NYSE correctly notes, debt securities enjoy seniority over equity securities. Because the NYSE presumably
would not have listed the junior equity issue unless it was satisfied with the quality of the company, the Commission
is unable to conclude that the NYSE has no basis for its assumption that the senior debt issue also warrants listed status.






For ``unaffiliated'' issuers, the Commission finds that it is not unreasonable for the Exchange to defer to the expertise
of an NRSRO, rather than conducting its own analysis of the company's financial condition, as is presently the case.
 Although the Commission would be concerned by any potential misuse of NRSRO ratings, the Commission notes that the
NRSROs routinely evaluate interest coverage, among other things, when they rate bonds. In addition, their methodology,
unlike the NYSE's, incorporates even more extrinsic factors, such as characteristics of the issuer's industry group.
 The Commission therefore agrees with the Exchange that, under these circumstances, NRSRO ratings can be relied upon
for determinations about the creditworthiness of the issuer.





Moreover, the Commission is satisfied that the distinctions in NRSRO ratings drawn by the NYSE are valid. According
to the S&P Corporation's debt rating definitions,
 bonds rated ``B'' (or higher) currently have the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments, whereas
bonds rated ``CCC'' (or lower) are dependent upon favorable business, financial or economic conditions to meet timely
payments of interest and repayment of principal. The Commission also believes that it is logical for the NYSE to assume
that an unrated debt issue which is 

pari passu

 with (or senior to) an issue with at least a ``B'' rating would, if rated, receive an equal (or higher) rating. Finally,
to permit the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are immediately junior to an investment grade issue is appropriate because
those bonds generally would be rated no more than one rating category lower (

i.e.

, a S&P Corporation ``BB'' rating).

<TEXT>
 

As for the other provisions in Paragraphs 102.03 and 103.05, the Commission finds that they strike an appropriate
balance between protecting investors and enhancing the flexibility of the debt listing process. For instance, the
proposed rule change retains the current requirement that, to be eligible for listing, a bond issue must have an aggregate
market value or principal amount of at least $5 million. This should enable the NYSE to deny listed status to companies
whose securities do not have sufficient liquidity for a fair and orderly market, without infringing upon 

bona fide

 issuers' access to the Exchange's bond trading and disclosure systems.

Conversely, the Commission does not believe that eliminating the distribution requirement will have a significant
adverse effect on investors in the bond market. The NYSE currently evaluates distribution of debt securities in an
ad hoc fashion. The NYSE does not specify a mandatory minimum threshold for the number of bonds outstanding and/or
the number of holders thereof but only requires a distribution ``sufficient for trading on the Exchange.'' In the
past, the Commission has recognized that such information may be difficult to estimate accurately and may be relatively
less pertinent than other factors.
 From the Commission's perspective, the benefits of streamlining the Exchange's substantive review is appropriate,
especially since the NYSE has discretion not to list an otherwise eligible debt issue if such status would be unwarranted.





In terms of the delisting criteria in Paragraph 802.00, the Commission has concluded that the revised standards should
enable the NYSE to identify listed companies that may have insufficient resources to meet their financial obligations
or whose debt securities may lack adequate trading depth and liquidity. This, in turn, will allow the Exchange to take
appropriate action to protect bondholders. In this regard, the NYSE has indicated that it normally will not delist
a debt security if it has value and if continued exchange trading is in the best interests of investors; however, the
NYSE has pledged to give serious consideration to delisting bonds which, based on their market price,
 have minimal or no value. In applying this standard, the Commission expects the NYSE to consider carefully the propriety
of continued exchange trading of the securities of bankrupt or distressed companies,
 and expects bonds with minimal value to be delisted.






The Commission also is satisfied with the NYSE's framework for the listing and delisting of convertible debt securities.
By authorizing the Exchange to list and trade bonds that are convertible into any equity security subject to real-time
last sale reporting in the United States (rather than merely NYSE listed common stock), the proposed rule change should
help the NYSE adapt to today's rapidly changing market environment.
 The Commission notes that, like the NYSE, the other national securities exchanges and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') make quote and trade information publicly available on a ``real-time'' basis.
As a result, the Commission believes that the NYSE proposal should ensure that investors have information necessary
to price convertible bonds.

<TEXT>
 

In the Commission's opinion, the above goals also will be furthered by the requirement that convertible bonds be delisted
whenever the underlying equity security is no longer subject to a reporting obligation. If the related equity merely
moves from the NYSE to another market, it is not inconsistent with the Act for the Exchange to have discretion to continue
listing the convertible debt, unless the underlying security is delisted because the issuer has violated one of the
NYSE's corporate responsibility criteria. As a general matter, the Commission would have serious concerns about
any proposal that does not provide for the delisting of convertible bonds where a company acts to disadvantage its
shareholders. The NYSE addresses this concern by committing to delist convertible bonds when the issuer has violated
corporate governance listing standards.
Finally, at this time, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the NYSE to treat the debt of certain noncorporate
issuers (

i.e., 

foreign governments, American states and localities, government agencies) like the debt of ``unaffiliated'' corporate
issuers. As such, non-corporate debt would have to meet certain rating requirements before listing.
 Nevertheless, as the NYSE gains experience with listing and trading sovereign and municipal bonds, the Commission
expects the Exchange to monitor the adequacy of its existing standards and to develop more narrowly tailored ones
where appropriate.




The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 clarifies and codifies the intent of certain language used in the original
filing. Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full
statutory period.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rules change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to Amendment No. 1 between the Commission and any persons, other than those that may be withheld
from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the
Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also
be available at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-93-49
and should be submitted by June 2, 1994.


IV. Conclusion




It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-49), including Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis,
is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

3. Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth (TLP): The purpose of the TLP is to support projects in local communities
that provide long term shelter, skill training and support services to homeless youth; to assist homeless youth in
making smooth transitions to self-sufficiency; and to prevent long-term dependency on social services. 

4. Training and Technical Assistance (T&TA) Grants: The purpose of this T&TA is to improve the programmatic
and administrative capacities of public and private agencies serving runaway and homeless youth.

Part I. General Information 


A. Background on Runaway and Homeless Youth 


The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB), within the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF), administers
programs that support services to an adolescent population of approximately 1.3 million runaway and homeless youth.
Many of these youth have left home to escape abusive situations, or because their parents could not provide them with
the basic needs of food, shelter and a safe supportive environment. Many live on the streets. 
While living on the streets or away from home without parental supervision, these youth are highly vulnerable. They
may become victims of street violence, or may be exploited by dealers of illegal drugs. Usually lacking marketable
skills, they may be drawn into shoplifting, prostitution, and dealing drugs in order to earn money for food, clothing,
and other daily expenses. Without a fixed address or regular place to sleep, they often drop out of school, forfeiting
their opportunities to learn and to become independent, self-sufficient, contributing members of society. As street
people, they may try to survive with little or no contact with medical professionals, the result being that their health
problems may go untreated and may worsen. Without the support of family, schools, and other community institutions,
they may not acquire the personal values and work skills that will enable them to enter or advance in the world of work
at other than the most minimal levels. Finally, as street people, they may create substantial law enforcement problems,
endangering both themselves and the communities in which they are located. All these problems, real and potential,
call for a nationwide, community-based program to address the needs of runaway and homeless youth. 


B. Legislative Authority 


Grants for the Basic Center Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth are authorized by Part A of the Runaway and Homeless
Youth Act (RHY Act), 42 U.S.C. 5701 

et seq.

 The RHY Act was enacted as Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-415),
and amended by the Juvenile Justice Amendments of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-115), the Juvenile Justice Amendments of
1980 (Pub. L.96-509), the Juvenile Justice Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-473), the Anti-Drug Abuse Act
of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690), and the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub.
L. 102-586). 
Grants for the Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth are authorized under Part B of the Runaway and Homeless
Youth Act. Part B was established in 1988 as part of Public Law 100-690. 
Grants for the Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth are authorized under section
3511 of Public Law 100-690, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Anti-Drug Abuse Act), which established the Drug
Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth, as amended by Public Law 102-132.

C. Purpose, Goals and Objectives of the Federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Grant Programs 




1. Basic Center Programs for Runaway and Homeless Youth 




The overall purpose of the BCP is to provide financial assistance to establish or strengthen community-based centers
that address the immediate needs (e.g., outreach, temporary shelter, food, clothing, counseling, and aftercare
services) of runaway and homeless youth and their families. Services supported by this program are to be outside the
law enforcement, the child welfare, the mental health, and the juvenile justice systems. The program goals and objectives
of Part A of the RHY Act are to: 


a. Alleviate problems of runaway and homeless youth, 


b. Reunite youth with their families and encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counseling and
other services, 


c. Strengthen family relationships and encourage stable living conditions for youth, and 


d. Help youth decide upon constructive courses of action. 




2. Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth 




The overall purpose of the DAPP is to help communities address the problem of drug abuse among runaway and homeless
youth through the prevention, early intervention, and reduction of drug dependency. The specific goals and objectives
of the program, as set forth in section 3511 of the Act, are to: 


a. Provide individual, family, and group counseling to runaway youth and their families and to homeless youth for
the purpose of preventing or reducing the illicit use of drugs by such youth; 


b. Develop and support peer counseling programs related to the illicit use of drugs by runaway and homeless youth;



c. Develop and support community education activities related to the illicit use of drugs by runaway and homeless
youth, including outreach to individual youth; 


d. Provide runaway and homeless youth in rural areas with assistance (including the development of community support
groups) related to the illicit use of drugs; 


e. Provide information and training regarding issues related to the illicit use of drugs by runaway and homeless youth
to individuals providing services to these youth; 


f. Support research on illicit drug use by runaway and homeless youth, the effects on such youth of drug abuse by family
members, and any correlation between such use and attempts at suicide; and 


g. Improve the availability and coordination of local services related to drug abuse for runaway and homeless youth.





3. Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth 




The overall purpose of the TLP is to support programs which assist older homeless youth in making a successful transition
to self-sufficient living and to prevent long-term dependency on social services. The specific goals and objectives
of the program, as set forth in Part B of the Act, are to: 

a. Provide stable, safe living accommodations while a homeless youth is a program participant; 


b. Provide the services necessary to assist homeless youth in developing both the skills and personal characteristics
needed to enable them to live independently; 


c. Provide education, information and counseling aimed at preventing, treating and reducing substance abuse among
homeless youth; 


d. Provide homeless youth with appropriate referrals and access to medical and mental health treatment; and 


e. Provide the services and referrals necessary to assist youth in preparing for and obtaining employment. 


The Administration on Children, Youth and Families will award grants for these programs to support direct services
to runaway and homeless youth. Specifics regarding each of these grant programs are found in Part III, Sections A-C,
of this announcement.

The overall purpose of the T&TA grants is to improve the programmatic and administrative capacities of public
and private agencies to serve runaway and homeless youth. Specifics regarding these grants are found in Part III,
Section D, of this announcement. 


D. Definitions 



1. The term homeless youth is defined differently for different programs. 


Under Part A of the RHY Act, which authorizes the BCP, the term homeless youth means a person under 18 years of age who
is in need of services and without a place of shelter where he or she receives supervision and care. This definition
applies to all Basic Center projects and can be found in 45 CFR 1351.1(f). 


Under Part B of the RHY Act, which authorizes the TLP, homeless youth means an individual who is not less than 16 years
of age and not more than 21 years of age; for whom it is not possible to live in a safe environment with a relative; and who
has no other safe alternative living arrangement. This definition applies to all TLP projects and can be found in section
321(b)(1) of the RHY Act. 

2. The term public agency means any State, unit of local government, combination of such States or units, or any agency,
department, or instrumentality of any of the foregoing. This definition applies to all runaway and homeless youth
programs and can be found in section 3601(8) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, incorporating by reference section 103(11)
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended. 


3. The term runaway youth means a person under 18 years of age who absents himself or herself from home or place of legal
residence without the permission of parents or legal guardian. This definition applies to all Basic Center programs
and can be found in 45 CFR 1351.1(k). 


4. The term shelter includes host homes, group homes and supervised apartments. This definition applies to all TLP
programs and is referenced in section 322(1) of the RHY Act. As currently understood in the field: 


Host homes are facilities providing shelter, usually in the home of a family, under contract to accept runaway and/or
homeless youth assigned by the TLP service provider, and are licensed according to State or local laws. 


Group home are single-site residential facilities designed to house TLP clients who may be new to the program and/or
require a higher level of supervision. These dwellings operate in accordance with State or local housing codes and
licensure. 


Supervised apartments are single-unit dwellings or multiple-unit apartment houses operated under the auspices
of the TLP service provider for the purpose of housing program participants. 


5. The term State means any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam,
the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands (Palau). This definition applies to all runaway and homeless youth programs and can be found in section 3601(10)
of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, incorporating by reference section 103(7) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention
Act of 1974, as amended. 


6. The term temporary shelter means the provision of short-term (maximum of 15 days) room and board and core crisis
intervention services on a 24 hour basis. This definition applies to all Basic Center Program grantees and can be found
in 45 CFR 1351.1(o). 

7. The term transitional living youth project means a project that provides shelter and services designed to promote
transition to self-sufficient living and to prevent long-term dependency on social services. This definition applies
to all TLP program grantees and is found in section 321(b)(2) of the RHY Act. 




E. Final Priorities 




Section 364 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHY Act) requires the Department to publish annually for public
comment a proposed plan specifying priorities the Department will follow in awarding grants and contracts under
the RHY Act. The proposed plan for FY 1994 was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
January 28, 1994 and requested comments and recommendations from the field. 




1. Public Comments in Response to the Proposed Priorities 




The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) received 13 written responses from a number of sources, including Runaway
and Homeless Youth Program grantees in seven different States. The responses were generally supportive and the following
summarizes the major issues raised:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940512-2-00167 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

a. A number of respondents suggested that applicants with demonstrated experience in providing quality direct services
to runaway and homeless youth be awarded extra points in the evaluation and ranking of their grant applications. The
Administration for Children, Youth and Families agrees with this suggestion. Accordingly, applicants documenting
such experience may receive up to five (5) extra points beginning with the current (FY 1994) reviews. 
b. A number of respondents supported the proposal to increase the project periods of the new Training and Technical
Assistance (T&TA) awards from three to five years. The five-year project period will be adopted. 
c. A number of respondents suggested that the proposed focus of T&TA activities on findings resulting from the
monitoring of runaway and homeless youth grantees might be too narrow. They suggested that T&TA activities should
also address the perceived needs of local grantees, such as services to special populations and adherence to local
and State licensing requirements. The Administration on Children, Youth and Families recognizes that T&TA
providers may take into account such justified training needs, so long as a major emphasis is placed on assisting grantees
in program improvement efforts, especially those efforts related to the findings from program monitoring activities.

d. A number of respondents expressed concern that budget limitations on travel for Federal staff might lead to peer
reviewers making site visits unaccompanied by Federal staff, and that negative evaluations by the peers might undercut
Federal support for the affected grantees. The Administration on Children, Youth and Families recognizes that peer
reviewers can assess program operations from a professional point of view, identifying areas of strength and areas
for improvement, but that only Federal staff can be responsible for identifying and evaluating compliance issues
that may affect funding. 
e. Several respondents expressed concern about the potential for consolidation of the three current, categorical
programs for runaway and homeless youth (BCP, DAPP, and TLP) into a single program. Specific concerns included the
negative effects of limited funding, the possible neglect of RHY services in rural areas, and the difficulties of
a single grantee being required to address the entire range of youth problems. The Administration on Children, Youth
and Families is aware of these and a number of other concerns and issues regarding consolidation, and any effort to
consolidate these programs would include consultation with the field regarding implementation. 

f. A number of respondents requested that they be sent information about applying for runaway and homeless youth grants.
All respondents will be entered into the mailing list to receive announcements of grant solicitations.

To the extent feasible, ACYF addressed these and all other public comments in preparing the final priorities. The
final program priorities below reflect the changes made in the proposed priorities in light of the comments received.



2. Final Program Priorities for Fiscal Year 1994 


a. Direct Service Grants for Runaway and Homeless Youth. 
(1) Basic Center Program Grants. 
Part A, section 311 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to public and private entities,
(State, Territorial, county, and local governments; agencies and subagencies of these governments; private for-profit
and private non-profit organizations; American Indian Tribes) and to combinations of such entities, to establish
and operate Basic Centers for Runaway and Homeless Youth. 
Approximately 350 new and continuation Basic Center Program grants will be funded in FY 1994 to support organizations
which provide emergency services to runaway and homeless youth that include temporary shelter, food, clothing,
counseling, aftercare, and related services which are provided outside the law enforcement, child welfare, mental
health and juvenile justice systems. 
Part III, section A of this publication announces the availability of funds for these grants, and includes the minimum
requirements that applicants must address in their applications for Basic Center Program funds.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940512-2-00168 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940512-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In FY 1994, approximately two-thirds of the current Basic Center grantees (those whose grant periods expire in FY
1995 or FY 1996) will be awarded noncompetitive continuation funds. The remaining grantees (those whose grant periods
expire in FY 1994) will have the opportunity to compete for new grant awards by submitting new competitive applications.
All other eligible youth-serving agencies not holding current awards may also apply for these new competitive funds.

(2) Transitional Living Program Grants. 

Part B, section 321 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to establish and operate transitional
living projects for homeless youth. This program is structured to help older, homeless youth achieve self-sufficiency
and avoid long-term dependency on social services. Transitional living projects provide shelter, skills training,
and support services to homeless youth ages 16 through 21 for a continuous period not exceeding 18 months. 
A competition for new-start TLP awards was held in the summer of 1993 (in the last quarter of FY 1993) and successful
applicants were awarded a total of $5,966,650 in FY 1994 funds, beginning on October 1, 1993 (the first quarter of FY
1994). The remaining FY 1994 program funds will be awarded in the form of continuations to ongoing grants. 
This announcement solicits applications for new Transitional Living Program grant awards to be supported with FY
1995 funds, subject to the appropriation of these funds by Congress. Project periods for these new awards will begin
when FY 1995 funds are appropriated and made available to ACYF, but in no case will they begin prior to October 1, 1994.
By soliciting applications and making funding decisions during 1994, we will enable current grantees not eligible
for FY 1994 continuation funds to compete for new grants to be funded early in FY 1995 and to continue their existing
projects with a minimal disruption of services, if successful in the competition. 
Part III, section C of this publication announces the anticipated availability of funds for these FY 1995 grants,
and includes the minimum requirements that applicants must address in their grant proposals. 
b. National Communications System. 
Part C, section 331 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, mandates support for a national communications
system to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with their families and with service providers. 
In FY 1991, a three-year grant was awarded to the National Runaway Switchboard, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois, to operate
the system. This grant expired in FY 1994. 
An announcement soliciting grant applications to operate the system for five years was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1993. 
c. 

Program Support. 

(1) Training and Technical Assistance Grants.

<PARENT> FR940512-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Part D, section 342 of the RHY Act authorizes the Department to make grants to statewide and regional nonprofit organizations
to provide training and technical assistance (T&TA) to organizations that are eligible to receive service grants
under the Act. Organizations eligible to receive this T&TA include the Basic Centers authorized under Part A
of the Act and the Transitional Living grantees authorized under Part B. In addition, section 3511 of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, which authorized the Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth
(DAPP), authorizes support for T&TA to runaway and homeless youth service providers. The purpose of this T&TA
is to strengthen the programs and to enhance the knowledge and skills of youth service workers.

In FY 1991, the Family and Youth Services Bureau awarded ten Cooperative Agreements, one in each of the ten Federal
Regions, to provide T&TA to agencies funded under the three Federal programs for runaway and homeless youth (the
Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program). Each Cooperative
Agreement was unique, being based on the characteristics and different T&TA needs in the respective Regions.
Each of the Cooperative Agreements has a three-year project period that will expire in FY 1994.

This announcement solicits applications for new five-year Cooperative Agreements to be supported with FY 1994 funds.
Specific application information and evaluation criteria are addressed in Part III, Section D.

(2) National Clearinghouse on Runaway and Homeless Youth.

In June 1992, a five-year contract was awarded to establish and operate the National Clearinghouse on Runaway and
Homeless Youth to serve as a central information point for professionals and agencies involved in the development
and implementation of services to runaway and homeless youth.

The Clearinghouse is in full operation and is currently collecting materials and responding to requests for information.
Non-competitive continuation funding will be awarded to sustain the Clearinghouse in FY 1994.

(3) Management Information System (MIS).

In FY 1992, a three-year contract was awarded to implement the Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information
System (MIS) across three FYSB programs: The Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living
Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program. The MIS, now a mandatory data collection system, is designed to be
used as a management tool for individual programs. In addition, FYSB uses the data generated by the system to produce
reports, to conduct analyses regarding the programs, and to provide information for required reports to Congress
on efforts to serve runaway and homeless youth.

Non-competitive continuation funding will be awarded to sustain the MIS in FY 1994.

(4) Monitoring Support for FYSB Programs.

In FY 1993, FYSB developed a comprehensive monitoring instrument and set of site visit protocols, including a peer-monitoring
component, for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug
Abuse Prevention Program. Additionally in FY 1993, a contract to provide logistical support for the peer monitoring
system was awarded.

The new peer monitoring system will improve Federal oversight of the RHY programs and will identify program innovations
along with program strengths and weaknesses. The findings will be used to direct the provision of technical assistance
and to inform policy development.

Continuation funding for the logistical contractor will be provided in FY 1994.

d. Research and Demonstration Initiatives.

Section 343 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to States, localities, and private entities to carry
out research, demonstration, and service projects designed to increase knowledge concerning and to improve services
for runaway and homeless youth. These activities are important in order to identify emerging issues and to develop
and test models which address such issues.

In FY 1993, first-year funding was awarded to eight grantees to develop models of services to youth in rural areas.
These grants are expected to produce written descriptions of the proposed service models, to identify issues related
to model implementation, and to generate information on youth and program outcomes. The models will also incorporate
formal collaboration with other major youth-serving agencies in the rural areas.

Continuation funding of these eight grants will be provided in FY 1994.

e. Evaluation Study.

Continuation funding will be awarded to an ongoing evaluation study entitled ``Development of Manuals for ACYF to
Use in Evaluating Demonstration Projects'' (FY 1993-present). This project is developing general and specific
manuals to assist ACYF grantees in the design and implementation of their internal program evaluations. One of the
specific manuals will be designed for FYSB grantees.



F. Eligible Applicants



The legislation authorizing the runaway and homeless youth programs addressed in this 

Federal Register

 announcement identifies ``eligible applicants'' differently. Accordingly, the definition appropriate to each
individual program is found in Part III of this announcement as a part of each priority area description.

Organizations that have current Basic Center and/or Drug Abuse Prevention Program grants with project periods ending
in FY 1994 and all remaining eligible applicants may apply for new grants for either or both of these two programs. Basic
Center and DAPP grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation
funding in FY 1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program.

Organizations that have current Transitional Living Program grants with project periods ending in FY 1994 and all
remaining eligible applicants may apply for new Transitional Living Program grants. Transitional Living Program
grantees with one or two years remaining on their current awards and the expectation of continuation funding in FY
1994 may not apply for new grants under that particular grant program.

Statewide and Regional nonprofit organizations, and/or combinations of such organizations, with demonstrated
experience in providing services to runaway and homeless youth service providers are eligible to apply for T&TA
grants.

Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix D for a listing of current grantees that are ineligible to apply for one or
more of these grant programs.

Non-profit applicants which have not previously received financial support from the Administration on Children,
Youth and Families must submit proof of their non-profit status with their grant application. This can be done either
by making reference to the applicant's listing in the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt
organizations or by submitting a copy of its letter from the IRS (IRS Code, sections 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(6)). Non-profit
applicants cannot be funded without acceptable proof of this status. Failure to provide proof of nonprofit status
will result in rejection of the application. Such applications will receive no further consideration from ACF. For-profit
entities may participate as grantees under Priority Area A, Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Programs, but
may participate only as sub-grantees for any other priority areas in this announcement.



G. Availability of Funds



The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award approximately 600 new and continuation grants
to serve runaway and homeless youth in FY 1994. Dollar amounts to be awarded by fiscal year and program are as follows:



1. Basic Center Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth



The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award $32,499,000 in Basic Center Program grants in
FY 1994. Of this total, $18,377,159 will be awarded in the form of non-competitive continuations to current grantees,
and the remaining $14,121,841 will be available for competitive, new-start awards. In accordance with the RHY Act,
the funds will be divided among the States in proportion to their respective populations under the age of 18. We recognize
that the RHY Act also conditionally requires that the amounts allotted to each State (including the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico) be at least $100,000, and the amounts allotted to the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau), and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands be at least $45,000
each. However, to apply these minimum allocations in FY 1994 would result in 23 of the remaining States receiving less
than they received in FY 1992. Under these conditions, section 311(b)(3) of the Act becomes operable, which directs
that the ongoing State minimum of $75,000 and the ongoing Territorial minimum of $30,000 continue as the basic award
levels in FY 1994. The amount of funds available for both continuations and new starts in each of the States and Territories
is listed in the Table of Allocations by State (Part VI, Appendix E) which reflects the FY 1994 allocations for each
State. In this Table, the amounts shown in the column labeled New Starts are the amounts available for competition
in the respective States.

Current Basic Center Program grantees having one or two years remaining in their project periods will receive instructions
from their respective ACF Regional Offices on the procedures for applying for these continuation grants and should
not respond to this announcement. These grantees are listed in Part VI, Appendix D.1, have project expiration dates
in FY 1995 and 1996, and are not eligible to apply for new Basic Center grants.

Current Basic Center Program grantees with project periods ending by September 30, 1994, and all other eligible applicants
not currently receiving Basic Center funds may apply for the new competitive grants under this announcement. 
The number of new awards made within each State will depend upon the funds available (i.e., the State's total allotment
less the amount required for non-competing continuations), as well as on the number of acceptable applications.
Therefore, where the amount required for non-competing continuations in any State equals the State's total allotment,
no new awards will be made. 
All applicants under this announcement will compete with other applicants in the State in which their services would
be provided. In the event that an insufficient number of acceptable applications is approved for funding from any
State or jurisdiction, the Commissioner, ACYF, will reallocate the unused funds. 


2. Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth 


In FY 1994, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to award $2,000,000 in new competitive Drug
Abuse Prevention Program grants and $9,780,702 in non-competing continuation DAPP awards. 


3. Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth 


The Administration on Children, Youth and Families awarded $6,117,067 for 33 new Transitional Living Program grants
in the first quarter of FY 1994 (October-December 1993). An additional $5,095,648 will be awarded in FY 1994 for TLP
continuation grants. 
No additional new TLP awards will be made in FY 1994. However, applications for new awards will be solicited in FY 1994
for funds to be provided in FY 1995 (beginning on October 1, 1994), subject to appropriation of funds by the Congress.
It is anticipated that approximately $5,000,000 will be available for these new grants. 


4. Training and Technical Assistance Grants 


In FY 1994, the Administration on Children, Youth and Families estimates the award of $1,500,000 in new cooperative
agreements for the provision of training and technical assistance to RHY grantees. 


H. Duration of Projects 


This announcement solicits applications for projects of up to three years duration (36-month project periods),
with the exception of the T&TA cooperative agreements which will be awarded for five-year project periods. Initial
grant awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for one-year (12-month) budget periods. Applications for continuation
grants beyond the one-year budget periods, but within the 36-month project periods, will be entertained in subsequent
years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantees, and
determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government. 


I. Maximum Federal Share and Grantee Share of the Project 


The maximum amount of Federal funds for which an applicant can apply is specified in each program description found
in Part III of this announcement. 
The legislation authorizing runaway and homeless youth programs requires that grantees provide a non-Federal match
for Federal funds. In some cases, this non-Federal share is a percent of the total cost of the project and, in some cases,
it is a percent of the Federal share. Specific non-Federal share requirements for each Priority Area are found in Part
III of this announcement. 
The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions. Federal funds provided to States and services or
other resources purchased with Federal funds may not be used to match project grants. Applicants which do not provide
the required percentage of non-Federal share will not be funded. 
For-profit applicants for Basic Center Program grants are reminded that no grant funds may be paid as profit to any
recipient of a grant or sub-grant (45 CFR 74.705). 


Part II. Evaluation Criteria 


The five criteria that follow will be used to review and evaluate each application under each of the three RHY programs
and the training and technical assistance grants, and should be used in developing the program narrative. The point
values following each criterion heading indicate the numerical weight each criterion will be accorded in the review
process. Note that the highest possible value an application can receive is 105 points. See Criterion 4 for specific
information.

in Part III of this announcement should be organized and presented according to these five evaluation criteria. 


Part III. Priority Areas 


A. Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program 


Eligible applicants: 

Any State, unit of local government, combination of units of local government, public or private agency, organization,
institution, or other non-profit entity is eligible to apply for these funds. Federally recognized Indian Tribes
are eligible to apply for Basic Center grants. Non-Federally recognized Indian Tribes and urban Indian organizations
are also eligible to apply for grants as private, non-profit agencies. 
Grantees (including subgrantees) with current Basic Center grants who are eligible to apply for continuation funding
in FY 1994 may not apply for a new Basic Center grant under this announcement. Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix
D.1 for a listing of current grantees which are ineligible for grants under this priority area. 
As required by runaway and homeless youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated
experience establishing and operating centers that provide direct services to runaway and homeless youth in a manner
that is outside the law enforcement system, the child welfare system, the mental health system and the juvenile justice
system. Demonstrated experience providing direct services means three (3) or more years of continuous effort serving
runaway and homeless youth in one or more areas set forth in section 312 of the Act. Applications claiming credit for
this preference must include a statement of no more than one page documenting the relevant experience.

Program purpose, goals, and objectives: 

The Administration on Children Youth and Families will award approximately 150 new service grants to establish or
strengthen existing or proposed runaway and homeless youth Basic Centers. These programs must be locally controlled
efforts that provide temporary shelter, counseling and other services to juveniles who have left home without permission
of their parents or guardians or to other homeless juveniles. 

Applications are solicited under this priority area to carry out direct service projects designed to carry out the
program purpose, goals and objectives set forth in the legislation and as specified in Part I, section C.1 of this announcement.
These goals and objectives are: 

1. To alleviate the problems of runaway and homeless youth, 

2. To reunite youth with their families and to encourage the resolution of intrafamily problems through counseling
and other services, 

3. To strengthen family relationships and to encourage stable relationships for youth, and 

4. To help youth decide upon constructive courses of action. 



Background: 

The Runaway Youth and Homeless Youth Act was enacted in response to widespread concern regarding the alarming number
of youth who were leaving home without parental permission, crossing State lines, and who, while away from home, were
exposed to exploitation and other dangers of street life. 

Each Basic Center funded under the authorizing legislation is required to provide outreach to runaway and homeless
youth; temporary shelter for up to fifteen days; food; clothing; individual, group, and family counseling; and related
services. Many Basic Centers provide their services in residential settings with a capacity for no more than 20 youth.
Some centers also provide some or all of their shelter services through host homes (usually private homes under contract
to the centers), with counseling and referrals being provided from a central location. 

Currently, approximately 60,000 youth annually receive shelter for an average of 12 nights and other ongoing services
through ACYF-funded Basic Centers. The primary presenting problems of these youth include conflict with parents
or other adults, including physical and sexual abuse (63 percent); other family crises such as divorce, death, or
sudden loss of income (9 percent); and personal problems such as drug use, or problems with peers, school attendance
and truancy, bad grades, inability to get along with teachers, and learning disabilities (28 percent). 

Low self-esteem is a major problem among this population. Half (49 percent) have a poor self image; somewhat less than
half (43 percent) are depressed; and 12 percent are possibly suicidal. 

After receiving ongoing services from shelter programs, 50 percent of the youth return to their families. One-third
(33 percent) are provided alternative, but safe, long-term living arrangements. Five percent return to the streets,
and 12 percent leave the centers with no known destination. 



Minimum requirements for project design: 

As part of addressing the evaluation criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement, each applicant must address
the following items in the program narrative section of the proposal.

conditions or behaviors such as drug use, school failure, and delinquency. 

3. Applicant must discuss the existing support systems for at-risk youth and families in the area, with specific references
to law enforcement, health and mental health care, social services, school systems, and child welfare. In addition,
other agencies providing shelter and services to runaway and homeless youth in the area must be identified. 

4. Within the context of the existing support systems, applicant must demonstrate the need for the center and indicate
the objectives that the program would work toward fulfilling. 

5. Applicant must describe the area to be served by the proposed center, and must demonstrate that the center is or will
be located in an area which is frequented by and/or easily accessible by runaway and homeless youth.

Duration of project: 

This announcement solicits applications for Basic Center projects of up to three years duration (36-month project
periods). Initial grant awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for one-year (12-month) budget periods. Applications
for continuation grants beyond the one-year budget periods, but within the 36-month project periods, will be entertained
in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the
grantee, and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government. 


Federal share of project costs: 

Priority will be given to applicants which apply for less than $200,000 per year. The maximum Federal share for a 3-year
project period is $600,000. 



Applicant share of project costs:

 The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires a non-Federal matching requirement of ten percent of the total Federal
funds awarded. For example, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds over a three-year project period (based
on an award of $100,000 per twelve-month budget period) must include a match of at least $30,000 (10 % of the Federal
share). 


B. Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (DAPP) 




Eligible applicants: 

Any State, unit of local government (or combination of units of local government), public or non-profit private agency,
organization, institution, or other non-profit entity is eligible to apply for these funds. Federally recognized
Indian Tribes are eligible to apply for DAPP grants. Non-Federally recognized Indian Tribes and urban Indian organizations
are also eligible to apply for grants as private, non-profit agencies. 
Grantees (including subgrantees) with current DAPP grants with 12 or more months remaining in their project periods
may not apply for new DAPP grants under this announcement. Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix D.3 for a listing
of current grantees which are ineligible to apply for grants under this priority area. No more than one grant per legal
entity (organization) will be awarded under this priority area. Organizations submitting more than one application
for DAPP funds must understand that only one application will be considered for funding.

Legislation authorizing each of the Federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs requires that priority for funding
be given to agencies with experience in providing direct services to runaway and homeless youth. In line with this
requirement, applicants which have three (3) or more years of continuous effort serving runaway and homeless youth
in one or more areas set forth in section 312 of the Act are eligible to receive an additional five (5) points in this criterion.
Applications claiming credit for this preference must include a statement of no more than one page documenting the
relevant experience. Empirical or applied research experience is not considered direct service. 


Program purpose, goals and objectives: 

The Administration on Children, Youth and Families will award approximately 20 new grants to support services within
a community to maintain, improve and/or expand drug abuse prevention, early intervention, and reduction of drug
dependency services to runaway and homeless youth and their families. Applications are solicited under this priority
area to carry out direct service projects designed to address the issue of drug abuse among runaway and homeless youth
in the applicant's community as required by the goals and objectives set forth in the legislation and specified in
Part I, section C.2 of this announcement. 
Activities that may be maintained, improved and/or expanded through a DAPP grant include but are not necessarily
limited to: 
1. Improving networking and service coordination to increase the availability of services to runaway and homeless
youth; 
2. Expanding outreach activities, particularly street-based outreach programs; 

3. Providing individual, family, group, and/or peer prevention and intervention counseling related to alcohol
and other drug use; 
4. Strengthening intake and assessment procedures for substance abuse at runaway and homeless youth shelters; 

5. Coordinating services with drug treatment facilities and making referrals to treatment that are geared to the
runaway and homeless youth population; 

6. Providing aftercare and follow-up services to runaway and homeless youth with substance abuse problems who have
received shelter and/or non-residential services; 
7. Increasing staff knowledge and skills related to working with runaway and homeless youth with substance abuse
problems by improving or accessing training opportunities; 
8. Improving programming to address the unique cultural needs and concerns of minority runaway and homeless youth;

9. Involving and educating parents, siblings and peers of runaway and homeless youth receiving drug abuse prevention
services; 
10. Developing and implementing programs designed to reduce drug involvement among the target population by improving
coping skills and reducing stress factors arising from such problems as homelessness, family dysfunction, and peer
pressure; and 

11. Establishing linkages with community mental health programs that will provide comprehensive substance abuse
counseling and/or treatment to runaway and homeless youth. 
Efforts that will not be funded under this priority area include research and demonstration projects on illicit drug
use by runaway and homeless youth, and the direct provision of drug treatment services such as those services provided
in a medical setting or by medical personnel. 
This priority area is specifically targeted to runaway and homeless youth. Potential applicants interested in providing
drug abuse prevention services to high-risk youth other than those who are runaways or homeless are encouraged to
contact the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP). For information on CSAP grant programs and other drug abuse
prevention resources, applicants should contact the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information,
P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, Maryland 20847-2345; telephone: 1-800-729-6686. 


Background: 

The abuse of drugs has had an increasingly severe impact on runaway and homeless youth. Reports from shelters which
serve this client population indicate a growing drug abuse problem. In 1988, 15.4 percent of the youth entering shelters
indicated a personal drug abuse problem. In addition, 16.6 percent of the youth entering shelters reported that their
reason for running away was parental drug and/or alcohol abuse. 
A 1990 survey, conducted by the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services, of 185 community-based agencies that
serve runaway and homeless youth found substance abuse to be the leading health problem among the youth served. Several
other studies reveal that the incidence of substance abuse among runaway and homeless youth in large urban areas is
significantly greater than the rate of abuse among other adolescents. The prevalence of the problem is underscored
by the fact that not only are youth-serving agencies in major urban areas reporting an increase in drug use among their
client population, but that providers in small towns and rural communities also are finding that more than half of
their clients are reporting drug abuse as a primary problem.

While several studies provide some evidence of alcohol and drug abuse decline in the general youth population, recent
locally based studies indicate that this is not the trend among the runaway and homeless youth population. There is
a marked increase in the use of alcohol and other dangerous and addictive drugs such as cocaine and its derivative,
crack. Alcohol use among the younger adolescent population is also on the increase. 

This population's circumstances require more detailed and focused approaches to prevention and drug reduction
services than those provided by traditional approaches. Many runaway and homeless youth have already experimented
with, or become frequent users of, one or more drugs and need effective programs which help them understand drug use
problems and teach them the decision-making skills they need to maintain a drug-free lifestyle. 

The Drug Abuse Education and Prevention Program (DAPP) provides Federal assistance to comprehensively address
the problem of drug involvement among runaway and homeless youth. Since the program's inception in 1989, ACYF has
awarded approximately $82 million in discretionary grants to approximately 450 agencies and organizations located
throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These awards were made to support a wide
variety of locally determined project designs which address the problem of drug involvement among runaway and homeless
youth. 

While varying degrees of success have been reported by DAPP grantees, many of the most promising programs have implemented
one or more of the following components: 

1. Candid discussions between youth and street-wise peer counselors and/or recovering youth substance abusers
who can discuss addiction and recovery from their personal experience; 

2. Sessions in which youth obtain accurate facts on any and all aspects of substance abuse and treatment; 

3. Presentation of decision-making and self-assertiveness skills and techniques that assist youth in making independent
choices and avoiding drug-involved friends and environments; 

4. Counseling and/or other strategies for helping youth to understand both the underlying causes of drug use and the
effect of drugs on them, their families, their peers and their communities; 

5. Educational information that portrays the consequences of overdosing, the effects of drug withdrawal, and the
increased chances of contracting the HIV virus and AIDS; and 

6. The provision of specific and realistic information on various treatment options that are available, assistance
in enrolling in such programs, and appropriate follow-up by the service provider. 



Minimum Requirements for project design: 

As a part of addressing the evaluation criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement, applicants must address
the following items in the program narrative sections of their applications.

direct services to runaway and homeless youth, applicant must include a brief description of the organization and
its experience in providing services to this client population. 

2. Applicant must include a brief description of current and proposed staff skills and knowledge regarding runaway
and homeless youth and indicate how staff will be utilized in achieving the goals and objectives of the program. Information
on proposed staff training and brief resumes or job descriptions may be included. 

3. Applicant must describe procedures for maintaining confidentiality of records on the youth and families served.
Procedures must insure that no information on the youth and families is disclosed without the consent of the individual
youth, parent or legal guardian. Disclosures without consent can be made to another agency compiling statistical
records if individual identities are not provided or to a government agency involved in the disposition of criminal
charges against an individual runaway or homeless youth. 



Budget Appropriateness 



1. Applicant must discuss and justify the costs of the proposed project in terms of numbers of youth and families to
be served, types and quantities of services to be provided, and the anticipated outcomes for the youth and families.


2. The applicant must describe the fiscal control and accounting procedures that will be used to ensure prudent use,
proper disbursement, and accurate accounting of funds received under this program announcement. 



Duration of project: 

This announcement solicits applications for Drug Abuse Prevention Projects of up to three years duration (36-month
project periods). Initial grant awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for one-year (12-month) budget periods.
Applications for continuation grants beyond the one-year budget period, but within the 36 month project period,
will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory
progress of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government.




Federal share of project costs:

 Up to $100,000 per year, which equals a maximum Federal share of $300,000 for a 3-year project period. 



Applicant share of project costs:

 Grantees must provide at least 25 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the Federal share and the non-Federal share. For example, a project requesting $300,000 in Federal funds
over a three-year project period (based on an award of $100,000 per twelve-month budget period) must include a match
of at least $100,000 (25% of the total approved cost of the project). 



C. Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth (TLP)

Eligible Applicants: 

Eligible applicants for a TLP grant under this announcement include States, units of local government (or a combination
of units of local government), public or non-profit, private agency organizations, institutions or other non-profit
entities. Federally recognized Indian Tribes are eligible to apply for TLP grants. Non-Federally recognized Indian
Tribes and urban Indian organizations are also eligible to apply for grants as private, non-profit agencies. 

Grantees (including subgrantees) with current project periods extending into FY 1995 may not apply for new TLP grants
under this announcement. Applicants may refer to Part VI, Appendix D.2, for a listing of current grantees which are
ineligible for grants under this priority area. 

As required by runaway and homeless youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated
experience in providing direct services to runaway and homeless youth. In line with this requirement, applicants
which have three (3) or more years of continuous effort serving runaway and homeless youth in one or more areas set forth
in Section 312 of the Act are eligible to receive an additional five (5) points in this criterion. 



Program purpose, goals and objectives:

 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families will award approximately 25 new service grants to provide shelter,
skill training and support services to assist homeless youth in making a smooth transition to self-sufficiency and
to prevent long-term dependency on social services. Applications are solicited under this priority area to carry
out direct service projects designed to carry out the program purpose, goals and objectives set forth in the legislation
and as specified in Part I, section C.3 of this announcement. 


Funds available under Part B of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act are to be used to enhance the capacities of youth-serving
agencies in local communities to effectively address the service needs of homeless older adolescents and young adults.
Activities that may be maintained, improved and/or expanded through a TLP grant must include, but are not necessarily
limited to: 


1. Providing stable, safe living accommodations while a homeless youth is a program participant; 


2. Providing the services necessary to assist homeless youth in developing both the skills and personal characteristics
needed to enable them to live independently; 


3. Providing education, information and counseling aimed at preventing, treating and reducing substance abuse
among homeless youth; 


4. Providing homeless youth with appropriate referrals and access to medical and mental health treatment; and 


5. Providing the services and referrals necessary to assist youth in preparing for and obtaining employment. 




Background: 

It is estimated that about one-fourth of the youth served by all runaway and homeless youth programs are homeless.
This means that many of the youth served cannot return home or to another safe living arrangement with a relative. Other
homeless youth have aged out of the child welfare system and are no longer eligible for foster care. 

These young people are often homeless through no fault of their own. The families they can no longer live with are often
physically and sexually abusive and involved in drug and alcohol abuse. They cannot provide the youth with their basic
human needs such as shelter, food, clothing, let alone the supportive and safe environment needed for development
of healthy self-images and the skills and personal characteristics which would enable them to mature into self-sufficient
adults.

Homeless youth, lacking a stable family environment and without social and economic supports, are at high risk of
being involved in dangerous lifestyles and problematic or delinquent behaviors. More than two-thirds of homeless
youth served by ACYF-funded programs report using drugs or alcohol and many participate in survival sex and prostitution
to meet their basic needs. 

Homeless youth need a support system that will assist them in making the transition to adulthood and independent living.
While all adolescents are faced with adjustment issues as they approach adulthood, homeless youth experience more
severe problems and are at greater risk. 

Homeless youth have been a population eligible to receive services under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act since
1978, but the service goals for homeless youth are different from those of runaways. For example, family reunification,
though desirable, is typically not feasible for homeless youth. In many instances, programs serving the homeless
populations are able to provide only limited assistance to homeless youth, whose needs are more complex and longer-term
than those of runaway youth. 

The Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth specifically targets services to homeless youth and affords
youth service agencies an opportunity to serve homeless youth in a manner which is comprehensive and geared towards
ensuring a successful transition to self-sufficiency. The TLP also improves the availability of comprehensive,
integrated services for homeless youth, which reduces the risks of exploitation and danger to which these youth are
exposed while living on the streets without positive economic or social supports.

<TEXT>
 

2. Applicant must describe the fiscal control and accounting procedures that will be used to ensure prudent use, proper
disbursement, and accurate accounting of funds received under this program announcement. 

3. Applicant must describe how cost-effective use of TLP funds will be ensured by taking maximum advantage of existing

are supported by Federal Independent Living Initiatives funds. Also, applicant must describe efforts to be undertaken
over the length of the project which may increase non-Federal resources available to support the TLP. 



Duration of project: 

Because successful applicants will receive grants with funds appropriated by Congress for FY 1995, project periods
for these new awards will begin when FY 1995 funds are appropriated and made available to ACYF, but in no case will they
begin prior to October 1, 1994. 

This announcement solicits TLP applications for projects of up to three years duration (36-month project periods).
Initial grant awards, made on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year (12-month) budget period. Applications
for continuation grants beyond the one-year budget period, but within the 36-month project period, will be entertained
in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the
grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the government. 



Federal share of project costs: 

Up to $200,000 per year, which equals a maximum of $600,000 for a 3-year project period. 



Applicant share of the project: 

The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act requires a non-Federal matching requirement of ten percent of the total Federal
funds. For example, a project requesting $600,000 in Federal funds over a three-year project period (based on an award
of $200,000 per twelve-month budget period) must include a match of at least $60,000 (10% of the Federal share). 



D. Training and Technical Assistance Grants (T&TA)





Eligible applicants: 

Statewide and regional nonprofit organizations, and combinations of such organizations, with demonstrated experience
in providing services to runaway and homeless youth service providers. 



Program purpose, goals and objectives: 

The Administration on Children, Youth and Families expects to fund up to ten cooperative agreements to improve the
programmatic and administrative capacities of public and private agencies to provide services to runaway and homeless
youth by the provision of technical assistance and short-term training. Applications to provide such assistance
may cover one or more Federal Regions or may be restricted to a smaller geographic area (e.g., one or more States). 



Background information: 

Over the years, many State and local agencies and programs have been established to provide needed short- and long-term
services to runaway and homeless youth. These agencies are both public and private, profit-making and nonprofit.
Some focus on a single concern, such as drug abuse or dropout prevention, while others are multi- or even all-purpose
agencies, with specific components that deal with the physical health, mental health, family reunification and
functioning, employment, education and transitional living of these young people. 

Notwithstanding the significant numbers of effective agencies and competent professional staff dedicated to assisting
runaway and homeless youth across the country, services in some areas are inadequate or non-existent. In other cases,
existing programs lack staff members with the full range of skills required to carry out the responsibilities with
which the individual programs are charged. Also, many of the developed and tested curricula and models are little
known or understood, even among the programs and staff where they could be of greatest use. Further, as new issues and
problems emerge (for example, the glamorization of the youth drug culture by the news and entertainment media, and
the placement of troublesome youth in private mental institutions to remove them from the streets), even experienced
staff need to enhance their existing skills and to develop new ones. 

To address these issues, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, section 342, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program for
Runaway and Homeless Youth, section 3511 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, both administered by the Family and Youth
Services Bureau, authorize support to nonprofit organizations for the purpose of providing training and technical
assistance (T&TA) to runaway and homeless youth service providers. 

To effectively provide such assistance, extensive interaction with grantees, integration and sharing of knowledge,
coordination with components supporting the runaway and homeless youth system, and a cooperative relationship
among training and technical assistance providers is needed.

Projects in this priority area are intended to result in a process which encompasses the following types of activities:

1. The provision of assistance to grantees for the purpose of assessment of grantee and staff training needs and the
development, management and implementation of training plans that ensure staff have the skills to carry out their
responsibilities. Training and technical assistance designed and/or provided to grantees for this purpose must
be accessible and individualized, must provide concrete information and skill building and must include follow-up
efforts. 
2. The provision of quality staff training which focuses on skill development that (a) provides opportunities for
hands-on participation, direct observation, practice and expert feedback; (b) analyzes, integrates and transmits
knowledge obtained from research findings, curricula, and models of greatest interest to grantees; and (c) recognizes
new and emerging youth issues and provides intensive skills training in these areas. 
3. The collaborative exchange of monitoring and MIS information with runaway and homeless youth programs for the
purpose of planning training and technical assistance for the geographic area being served, and for the purpose of
providing follow-up training and technical assistance responsive to the findings resulting from monitoring individual
grantees; 
4. The promotion of a cooperative relationship among training and technical assistance providers for the exchange
of information regarding identified training needs, emerging youth issues, research findings, curricula and models.

The award of these cooperative agreements will include a delineation of the responsibilities of the successful applicants
and the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. The responsibilities contained in each cooperative agreement
may be geared toward the unique needs of the RHY programs in the geographic areas to be served. At a minimum, responsibilities
of the successful applicants will include development and implementation of a workplan, provision of training and
technical assistance to grantees and coordination with other grantee support efforts and T&TA providers. Responsibilities
of ACYF will include, at a minimum, review and approval of workplans, coordination and sharing of monitoring data,
as appropriate, and sponsorship of a national meeting of T&TA providers.

The maximum Federal share is not to exceed $150,000 per Federal Region for the first 12-month budget period, or a maximum
of $750,000 per Federal Region for the 5-year project period. (For example, a project covering two Regions may receive
up to $300,000 for the first 12-month budget period. Conversely, a project serving less than a Federal Region (e.g.,
a Statewide system) would receive less than $150,000 for the first 12-month budget period.) 


Matching Requirement: 

The minimum non-Federal matching requirement in proportion to the maximum Federal share of $750,000 is $75,000 for
a 5-year project period. This constitutes 10 percent of the total Federal share. 


Anticipated number of projects to be funded: 

It is anticipated that up to ten projects will be funded.

D. Notification Under Executive Order 12372 


This program is covered under Executive Order (E.O.) 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45
CFR part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities. Under
the E.O., States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under
covered programs. 
All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applications for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
must contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as early as possible so that the program office
can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required
materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or date of contact if no submittal is required)
on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing
continuation awards. 
The SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they must be addressed to: Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs, Department
of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant
Promenade, SW., Aerospace Building, 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20047. Attn: Maiso Bryant. 
A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Part VI, Appendix H of this announcement.



Availability of Forms and Other Materials 


A copy of the forms required to be submitted as part of each application for a runaway and homeless youth grant, and instructions
for completing the application, are provided in Part VI, Appendix I. The Basic Center Program Performance Standards
as well as descriptions of the National Runaway Switchboard and the National Clearinghouse on Runaway and Homeless
Youth are presented in Part VI, Appendices A, B and C. Addresses of the State Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) to which
applicants must submit review copies of their proposals are listed in Part VI, Appendix H. 
Legislation referenced in Part I, section B of this announcement may be found in major public libraries and at the ACF
Regional Offices listed in Part VI, Appendix F at the end of this announcement.

Additional copies of this announcement may be obtained from the ACF Regional Offices or by calling the telephone number
listed at the beginning of this announcement. Further general information may be obtained from the Training and Technical
Assistance Providers listed in Part VI, Appendix G. 


F. Application Consideration 


All applications which are complete and conform to the requirements of this program announcement will be subject
to a competitive review and evaluation process against the specific criteria outlined in Part II of this announcement
and the specific Minimum Requirements for Project Design contained in Part III of this announcement. This review
will be conducted in Washington, DC, by teams of non-Federal experts knowledgeable in the areas of youth development
and/or human service programs. Applications for a Basic Center Program grant will be reviewed competitively only
with other applications from the same State. Applications for Drug Abuse Prevention Program, Transitional Living
Program and Training and Technical Assistance grants will be reviewed as a part of a national competition. 
The non-Federal experts will review the applications based on the Evaluation Criteria listed in Part II of this announcement
and the specific Minimum Requirements for Project Design contained in Part III of this announcement and will assign
a score to each application. The results of the competitive review will be analyzed by Federal staff who, in consultation
with ACF Regional officials, will select those applications to be recommended for funding to the Commissioner, ACYF.

The Commissioner will make the final selection of the applicants to be funded. As required by runaway and homeless
youth legislation, priority for funding will be given to agencies with demonstrated experience in providing direct
services to runaway and homeless youth. However, current grantees ending a three-year funding period, and applying
as a new applicant for funds under this program announcement, are reminded that when the current project period ends
so does the funding agency's obligation for future awards. Criterion 3, Approach, requires applicants to specifically
discuss how their project will be maintained after termination of Federal support. 
In addition to scores assigned by non-Federal reviewers, consideration also will be given to adequate geographic
distribution of services and the Commissioner may show preference for applications proposing services in areas
that would not otherwise be served. The Commissioner also may elect to consider an applicant's past performance in
providing services to runaway and homeless youth and also may elect not to fund any applicants having known management,
fiscal or other problems which make it unlikely that they would be able to provide effective services. 
Grant awards for Basic Center Program, Drug Abuse Prevention Program and Training and Technical Assistance grants
will be made by September 30, 1994. Grant awards for Transitional Living Program grants will be made after October
1, 1994. Successful applicants will be notified through the issuance of a Financial Assistance Award which will set
forth the amount of funds granted, the terms and conditions of the grant, the effective date of the grant, the budget
period for which support will be given, the non-Federal share to be provided, and the total project period for which
support is contemplated. 
Organizations whose applications will not be funded will be notified of that decision in writing by the Commissioner
of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. Every effort will be made to notify all unsuccessful applicants
as soon as possible after final decisions are made, including grantees whose three-year project periods end in FY
1994. 


Part V. Application Assembly and Submission

Part VI. Appendices


Appendix A_Basic Center Program Performance Standards


Program Performance Standards


I. Purpose



The Program Performance Standards established by the Bureau for its funded centers relate to the basic program components
enumerated in section 317 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and as further detailed in the Regulations and Program
Guidance governing the implementation of the Act. They address the methods and processes by which the needs of runaway
and homeless youth and their families are being met, as opposed to the outcome of the services provided on the clients
served.

The terms program performance standard, criterion, and indicators are used throughout both the instrument and the
instructions. These terms are defined as follows:



Program performance standard: 

The general principle against which a judgment can be made to determine whether a service or an administrative component
has achieved a particular level of attainment.



Criterion: 

A specific dimension or aspect of a program performance standard which helps to define that standard and which is amenable
to direct observation or measurement.



Indicator: 

The specific documentation which demonstrates whether a criterion (or an aspect of a criterion) is being met and thereby
the extent to which a specific aspect of a standard is being met.

Fourteen program performance standards, with related criteria, are established by the Bureau for the projects funded
under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act. Nine of these standards relate to service components (outreach, individual
intake process, temporary shelter, individual and group counseling, family counseling, service linkages, aftercare
services, recreational programs, and case disposition), and five to administrative functions or activities (staffing
and staff development, youth participation, individual client files, ongoing project planning, and board of directors/advisory
body).

Although fiscal management is not included as a program performance standard, it is viewed by FYSB as being an essential
element in the operation of its funded projects. Therefore, as validation visits are made, the Regional ACF specialist
and/or staff from the Office of Fiscal Operations will also review the project's financial management activities.

FYSB views these program performance standards as constituting the minimum standards to which its funded projects
should conform. The primary assumption underlying the program performance standards is that the service and administrative
components which are encompassed within these standards are integral (but not sufficient in themselves) to a program
of services which effectively addresses the crisis and long-term needs of runaway and homeless youth and their families.

The program performance standards are designed to serve as a developmental tool, and are to be employed by both the
project staff and the Regional ACF staff specialists in identifying those service and administrative components
and activities of individual projects which require strengthening and/or development either through internal
action on the part of staff or through the provision of external technical assistance.



II. Program Performance Standards and Criteria



The following constitute the program performance standards and criteria established by the Bureau for its funded
centers. Each standard is numbered, and each criterion is listed after a lower case letter.

1. Outreach.

The project shall conduct outreach efforts directed towards community agencies, youth and parents.

2. Individual Intake Process.

The project shall conduct an individual intake process with each youth seeking services from the project. The individual

Instructions for the SF 424


This is a standard form used by applicants as a required facesheet for preapplications and applications submitted
for Federal assistance. It will be used by Federal agencies to obtain applicant certification that States which have
established a review and comment procedure in response to Executive Order 12372 and have selected the program to be
included in their process, have been given an opportunity to review the applicant's submission.


Item and entry


1. Self-explanatory.
2. Date application submitted to Federal agency (or State if applicable) & applicant's control number (if applicable).
3. State use only (if applicable).
4. If this application is to continue or revise an existing award, enter present Federal identifier number. If for
a new project, leave blank.
5. Legal name of applicant, name of primary organizational unit which will undertake the assistance activity, complete
address of the applicant, and name and telephone number of the person to contact on matters related to this application.
6. Enter Employer Identification Number (EIN) as assigned by the Internal Revenue Service.
7. Enter the appropriate letter in the space provided.


8. Check appropriate box and enter appropriate letter(s) in the space(s) provided:


_``New'' means a new assistance award.
_``Continuation'' means an extension for an additional funding/budget period for a project with a projected completion
date.
_``Revision'' means any change in the Federal Government's financial obligation or contingent liability from an
existing obligation.


9. Name of Federal agency from which assistance is being requested with this application.
10. Use the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number and title of the program under which assistance is requested.
11. Enter a brief descriptive title of the project, if more than one program is involved, you should append an explanation
on a separate sheet. If appropriate (e.g., construction or real property projects), attach a map showing project
location. For preapplications, use a separate sheet to provide a summary description of this project.
12. List only the largest political entities affected (e.g., State, counties, cities).
13. Self-explanatory.
14. List the applicant's Congressional District and any District(s) affected by the program or project.
15. Amount requested or to be contributed during the first funding/budget period by each contributor. Value of in-kind
contributions should be included on appropriate lines as applicable. If the action will result in a dollar change
to an existing award, indicate 

only

 the amount of the change. For decreases, enclose the amounts in parentheses. If both basic and supplemental amounts
are included, show breakdown on an attached sheet. For multiple program funding, use totals and show breakdown using
same categories as item 15.
16. Applicants should contact the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for Federal Executive Order 12372 to determine
whether the application is subject to the State intergovernmental review process.
17. This question applies to the applicant organization, not the person who signs as the authorized representative.
Categories of debt include delinquent audit disallowances, loans and taxes.
18. To be signed by the authorized representative of the applicant. A copy of the governing body's authorization for
you to sign this application as official representative must be on file in the applicant's office. (Certain Federal
agencies may require that this authorization be submitted as part of the application.)

















Instructions for the SF-424A
General Instructions


This form is designated so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of section B.


Section A. Budget Summary


Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)


For applications pertaining to a 

single

 Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and 

not requiring

 a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to a 

single

 program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column

 (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).
For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs 

require

 a breakdown by function or activity, prepare a separate sheet for each program requiring the breakdown. Additional
sheets should be used when one form does not provide adequate space for all breakdown of data required. However, when
more than one sheet is used, the first page should provide the summary totals by programs.


Lines 1-4, Columns (c) through (g.)




For new applications,

 leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e), (f), and (g) the appropriate
amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a year).
For continuing grant 

program applications

, submit these forms before the end of each funding period as required by the grantor agency. Enter in Columns (c) and
(d) the estimated amounts of funds which will remain unobligated at the end of the grant funding period only if the Federal
grantor agency instructions provide for this. Otherwise, leave these columns blank. Enter in columns (e) and (f)
the amounts of funds needed for the upcoming period. The amount(s) in Column (g) should be the sum of amounts in Columns
(e) and (f).



For supplemental grants and changes

 to existing grants, do not use Columns (c) and (d). Enter in Column (e) the amount of the increase or decrease of Federal
