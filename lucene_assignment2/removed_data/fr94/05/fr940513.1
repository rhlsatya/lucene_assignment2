OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT








Student Educational Employment Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Personnel Management.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Personnel Management is proposing to consolidate existing Federal student employment programs into
one streamlined, flexible program that: adapts to changing market conditions and occupational demands, encourages
greater participation and partnerships between Federal agencies and educational institutions in developing effective
programs, and serves as a critical tool to assist agencies in building a diverse workforce. The program would consist
of two components: work-study and temporary student positions.


Over the years, a number of different student employment programs and appointing authorities have often impeded
Federal agencies from meeting critical employment challenges with innovative solutions. This new framework will
substitute complex regulatory guidance with a flexible approach to developing student educational and employment
programs.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under this authority, agencies can develop innovative work-study or temporary programs to attract students. For
instance, agencies could create internship programs with a tuition assistance option for students attending college
(associate, undergraduate, and graduate), and vocational and technical institutions. Students in these agency/academic
tailored programs can be employed in professional, scientific, administrative, technical, clerical, and trades/crafts
occupations.

Proposed Amendments



Under the proposed regulations, a new authority, the Student Educational Employment Program, would replace the
following:

 Schedule A authority  213.3102(p) graduate students in scientific, professional or analytical positions;

 Schedule A authority  213.3102(q), students in scientific, professional and technical positions,
GS-9 and below;

 Schedule A authority  213.3102(v), temporary summer aid;
 Schedule A authority  213.3102(w), stay-in-school program;
 Schedule A authority  213.3102(y), summer employment;

 Schedule A authority  213.3102(jj), legal intern positions;

 Schedule B authority  213.3202(a) through (c), (e) and (g), cooperative education program;

 Schedule B authority  213.3102(d), Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program; and

 Schedule B authority  213.3202(f), Federal Junior Fellowship Program.

Using the new program, agencies would appoint students under  213.3202(b) (work study) and  213.3202(c)
(temporary). The new schedule B authority would contain both a Work-Study Component,  213.3202(b) and a Temporary
Student Component,  213.3202(c).

Under the new program, the definition of student is an individual who is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in at least
a half-time academic course load in an accredited high school, technical or vocational, associate, baccalaureate,
graduate, or professional diploma or certificate program. An individual is still deemed to be a student as long as
there are no breaks in course work of more than 5 months and the student shows to the satisfaction of the agency and academic
institution that he/she has a bona fide intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training. An individual
who has to complete less than half of an academic course load immediately prior to graduating is still considered a
student.

Agencies may appoint students on a full-time, part-time or intermittent basis at any time during the year. The student's
work schedule should not interfere with his or her academic studies.



Work-Study Component



The work-study component provides experience that is directly related to the student's educational program. Agencies
should appoint students under  213.3202(b) when the job is related to their academic field of study. Programs
developed under this component provide for a schedule of periods of attendance at an accredited school combined with
periods of career-related work in a Federal agency. Agencies, participating educational institutions, and students
should agree on a formally-arranged schedule of school and work to ensure that work responsibilities do not interfere
with academic performance.

Students appointed under this component will be classified as Student Trainees, to the -99 series of the appropriate
occupational group.

Students appointed under  213.3202(b) (work study) may be noncompetitively converted to a career or career-conditional
appointment under Executive Order 12015 when students have: (1) completed within the preceding 120 days an educational
program and course requirements at an accredited school; (2) completed at least 640 hours of career-related work,
before completion of or concurrently with, the course requirements (agencies have the option of increasing this
requirement for some or all of its occupation fields); (3) been recommended by the employing agency in which the career-related
work was performed; and (4) met the qualification standards for the targeted position to which the student is appointed.
Conversions will be to an occupation related to the student's academic training and work-study experience.



Temporary Student Component



This component provides flexibility to agencies to appoint students on a temporary basis to jobs that may/may not
be related to the students' academic field of study. The intent of a temporary student component is to provide maximum
flexibility and opportunity to agencies and students that will meet both of their needs on a short-term basis.

Classification for students appointed under this component is based on the occupational series for which they are
hired.

Schedule B authority  213.3202(c) would be used for students employed on a not-to-exceed 1 year appointment.
Appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments as long as the employee is enrolled or accepted
for enrollment as a student in a diplomat or certificate program at an accredited academic institution and is performing
at the fully successful or higher performance summary level. Students would not be eligible for conversion to a career
or career-conditional appointment under this authority.



Movement Between Components



Agencies may noncompetitively move students between temporary and work-study components if students meet the requirements
for that component. Movement between components will require using the appointing authority for the component that
the student is entering.

Work performed in the temporary component can not be credited toward meeting the work period requirements of the work-study
component.


Student Volunteers


The student volunteer program will continue to be covered by Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, part 308, Volunteer
Service.


Student Financial Assistance Option


Under both components of this program, agencies have the option of using financial need criteria to hire talented
students who demonstrate a need for income from employment to continue their education. OPM will continue to develop
and distribute annual economic guidelines for use in determining financial need. State Employment Service Offices
and financial aid offices in schools can assist in making these determinations.


Benefit Entitlements


Since it is expected that appointments under the work-study component would be for more than 1 year, students would
be eligible for retirement, health benefits, and life insurance. Students under the temporary component are not
eligible for retirement or life insurance but would become eligible for health benefits coverage only after they
complete 1 year of current, continuous employment. Since under the temporary appointment no Government contribution
would be available, the employee would pay the entire premium.


Tuition Assistance


Under both components of this program, agencies may use their training authority in 5 U.S.C. chapter 41 and 5 CFR part
410 to pay for all or part of training expenses. Under the work-study component, an agency may pay other expenses directly
related to training, including travel and transportation expenses between duty stations and schools.


Employment of Minors


Participation in this program must be in conformance with Federal, State or local laws and standards governing the
employment of minors.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation applies only to appointment procedures for certain employees in Federal agencies.

Importation of Fruits and Vegetables


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to allow, under certain conditions, the cold treatment of imported fruits upon arrival at the port
of Wilmington, NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers
that are adequate to prevent the introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape
from shipments of fruit before undergoing cold treatment. We are also proposing to delete cold treatments in the regulations
and replace them with a reference to cold treatments in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual, which
is incorporated by reference.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Fruits and Vegetables regulations, contained in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56-8 (referred to below as ``the
regulations''), prohibit or restrict the importation of fruits and vegetables to prevent the introduction and dissemination
of injurious insects, including fruit flies, that are new to or not widely distributed in the United States. The Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture administers these regulations.

Under the regulations, APHIS allows certain fruits to be imported into the United States if they undergo sustained
refrigeration (cold treatment) sufficient to kill certain insect pests. Cold treatment temperature and refrigeration
period requirements vary according to the type of fruit and the pests involved. 
Most imported fruit that requires cold treatment undergoes cold treatment in transit to the United States. However,
APHIS allows imported fruit to undergo cold treatment after arrival in the United States at certain ports designated
by APHIS. 
Currently, cold treatment is limited to ports in the northern United States because APHIS has determined that insect
pests escaping from shipments of imported fruit after arrival in the United States would be unable to survive winter
weather conditions in the north. The following ports are currently authorized by APHIS to conduct cold treatment
on imported fruit: Atlantic ports north of, and including, Baltimore, MD; ports on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence
Seaway; Canadian border ports on the North Dakota border and east of North Dakota; and, for air shipments, Washington
DC, at Baltimore-Washington International and Dulles International airports. 
Recently, we received petitions from individuals at the ports of Wilmington, NC, and Gulfport, MS, requesting that
we amend the regulations to allow cold treatment to be conducted at these ports. On November 12, 1993, in response to
these petitions, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 59953, Docket No. 93-121-1) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment
on whether we should allow cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and in California. 
We solicited comments concerning this notice for a 45-day period ending on December 27, 1993. During that period,
we received four comments, three from State governments and one from a grower organization. Two comments opposed
allowing cold treatment at ports in the Southern United States and California, arguing that allowing such treatments
would place California and Florida citrus crops at too great a risk of fruit fly infestation. Another comment requested
that we perform a detailed pest-risk analysis before deciding whether to allow cold treatment at southern and California
ports. Another comment supported allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC. 
While we are still considering whether to allow cold treatment at other ports in the Southern United States and California,
we are now proposing to allow cold treatment of certain fruit, under certain conditions, at the port of Wilmington,
NC. We have determined that in the Wilmington, NC, area, there are climatic and biological barriers adequate to prevent
introduction of certain plant pests into the United States in the event they escape from shipments of fruit before
undergoing cold treatment. Also, we are proposing to impose additional special conditions regarding cold treatment
at Wilmington, NC, that would further reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction. 
In addition to meeting the requirements in  319.56-2d of the regulations regarding cold treatment, the
port of Wilmington, NC, cold treatment facilities would be required to operate under the following additional special
conditions: 
1. Bulk shipments (those shipments which are stowed and unloaded by the case or bin) of fruit arriving for cold treatment
must be packaged in fly-proof packaging that prevents the escape of adult, larval, or pupal fruit flies. 
2. Bulk and containerized shipments of fruit arriving at the port of Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment must be cold-treated
within the port, that is, the area over which the Bureau of Customs is assigned the authority to accept entries of merchandise,
to collect duties, and to enforce the various provisions of the customs and navigation laws in force. 
3. Advance reservations for cold treatment space at the port of Wilmington, NC, must be made prior to the departure
of a shipment from its port of origin. 
We believe these requirements would reduce the risk of fruit fly introduction into the United States in the event infested
shipments of fruit entered the port of Wilmington, NC.

Draft Risk Assessment Regarding Cold Treatment 





This proposal to allow cold treatment of fruit under certain conditions at the port of Wilmington, NC, is based, in
part, on a draft document, prepared by APHIS, assessing the pest risks associated with allowing cold treatment of
tropical fruit fly host materials at certain United States ports. Some of the risk mitigation measures discussed
in the draft are included in this proposal as requirements for the port of Wilmington, NC. Copies of this draft document
may be obtained from Mr. Victor Harabin at the address listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.





Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual 





We would revise the PPQ Treatment Manual, which has been incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations
at 7 CFR 300.1, to reflect the addition of Wilmington, NC, to the list of ports where cold treatment of imported fruits
can be conducted, under certain conditions, upon arrival. 



Miscellaneous 





We are also proposing to replace the four cold treatment schedules currently listed in  319.56-2d(a)
with a single reference to the Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) Treatment Manual, which is incorporated by reference
at 7 CFR 300.1. The cold treatments listed in the PPQ treatment manual are applicable for any fruit required to be cold
treated under 
 319.56-2d of the regulations. 



Also as a nonsubstantive editorial change, we are proposing to remove and reserve the regulations under  319.56-2q,
regarding conditions governing the entry into the United States of pummelo from Israel, and to add pummelo from Israel
to the list, under  319.56-2x, of fruits and vegetables requiring treatment as a condition of entry into
the United States. This change would simplify the regulations by placing pummelo from Israel on a list of commodities
with similar entry requirements, but would not revise current requirements concerning the entry into the United
States of pummelo from Israel. 



We are also proposing to make other nonsubstantive changes to the regulations for the sake of clarity. 





Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 





This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.




We are proposing to allow, under certain conditions, cold treatment of imported fruit upon arrival at the port of Wilmington,
NC. As a result of this proposal, a number of different fruits could be imported into Wilmington, NC. Specifically,
officials of the North Carolina State Ports Authority in Wilmington, NC, anticipate that apples, grapes, and pears
from Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa would be imported and cold treated at the port of Wilmington, NC. 



Approximately 20 million pounds of each fruit could be imported annually into Wilmington, NC, as a result of this rule,
though we anticipate the amount would be much smaller. While some of the fruit arriving at Wilmington, NC, would be
imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the United States, some merely would be shipments
diverted from other ports also approved to conduct cold treatment on arrival. In the following analysis of the potential
impact of this action on domestic producers of apples, grapes and pears, in order to demonstrate the greatest possible
economic impact, we have assumed that the maximum amount of fruit would be imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment,
and further, that those commodities would be imported in addition to the present volume of annual imports into the
United States. 



Also in the following analysis, we have used published price flexibilities to estimate the potential economic effects
of allowing apples, grapes, and pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC; flexibilities are used to estimate relationships
between changes in supply and subsequent changes in price. 





Apples 





In 1987, 36,718 farms in the United States, of which 1,186 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. Although it is
not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million or less,
according to Small Business Administration (SBA) size standards), it is likely that most would. In 1992, domestic
farms produced almost 5.78 billion pounds of apples for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $1.13 billion.




If the volume of apples imported into Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute
about 7.5 percent of current total imports into the United States, about 0.35 percent of current domestic production
and about 0.33 percent of the current total apple supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 




Assuming that a 0.33 percent increase in the supply of apples would lead to a decrease of about 0.20 percent in the domestic
price of apples (using a price flexibility for apples of ^0.590, based on all Eastern States' sales of North Carolina
apples), we estimate that this increase in supply would result in a price decrease of about $0.038 per hundredweight
(cwt), or $0.00038 per pound, from an original price of $0.195 per pound. As a result of the price decrease, there could
be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. apple producers of about $2.20 million, which is roughly 0.20 percent of the original
total revenue of $1.13 billion. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing apples to be cold treated at Wilmington,
NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. 






Grapes 






In 1987, 23,236 farms in the United States, of which 286 were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992 domestic
farms produced about 1.54 billion pounds of grapes for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $327 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. 




If the volume of grapes to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 2.9 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 1.3 percent of current domestic production and about 0.89 percent of the
current total grape supply in the United States (domestic and imports).

<PARENT> FR940513-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Assuming that a 0.89 percent increase in the supply of grapes would lead to a decrease of about 0.88 percent in the domestic
price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California grapes of ^0.981), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $3.73 per ton, or $0.0019 per pound, from an original price of $425.62 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. grape producers of about $2.9 million,
which is roughly 0.88 percent of the original total revenue of $327 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
grapes to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. 






Pears 






In 1987, 10,092 farms in the United States, 88 of which were in North Carolina, harvested apples. In 1992, domestic
farms produced about 890 million pounds of pears for the fresh market, with an estimated value of $168 million. Although
it is not known how many of these farms could be classified as small entities (annual gross receipts of $0.5 million
or less, according to SBA size standards), it is likely that most would. 




If the volume of pears to be imported were to reach 20 million pounds, it would constitute about 15.4 percent of current
total imports to the United States, about 2.2 percent of current domestic production and about 2.0 percent of the current
total pear supply in the United States (domestic and imports). 




Assuming that a 2.0 percent increase in the supply of pears would lead to a decrease of about 1.2 percent in the domestic
price of grapes (using a price flexibility for California pears of ^0.609), we estimate that this increase in supply
would result in a price decrease of about $4.51 per ton, or $0.0023 per pound, from an original price of $377.61 per ton.
As a result of the price decrease, there could be a decrease in total revenue to U.S. pear producers of about $2.0 million,
which is roughly 1.19 percent of the original total revenue of $168 million. We anticipate, therefore, that allowing
pears to be cold treated at Wilmington, NC, would not have a significant economic impact on domestic producers. 




Therefore, in light of the preceding analyses (which estimate greatest possible, and thus highly unlikely, economic
effects), as well as our expectation that most imports of fruit to Wilmington, NC, for cold treatment would occur during
the off-season for domestic production, we anticipate that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact
on domestic producers of apples, grapes, and pears. 




Furthermore, we anticipate that allowing cold treatment at the port of Wilmington, NC, could have beneficial economic
effects. Importers who routinely transport fruit to the Southeastern United States could benefit from this action
due to lower transportation costs. Freight companies and shipping companies in North Carolina, as well as the local
economy, might also benefit. Also, consumers are likely to gain from the increased selection of products and any price
decreases, albeit small, that occur with increases in supply. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 






Executive Order 12778 






This proposed rule would allow cold treatment of certain fruits to be conducted at the port of Wilmington, NC. If this
proposed rule is adopted, State and local laws and regulations regarding the importation of fruits under this rule
would be preempted while the fruits are in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution
and sale to the consuming public, and would remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question
of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If this proposed rule is adopted,
no retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Pork Promotion and Research 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the Pork Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act (Act) of 1985 and the Order issued thereunder,
this proposed rule would increase the amount of the assessment per pound due on imported pork and pork products to reflect
an increase in the 1993 six market average price for domestic barrows and gilts. This proposed action would bring the
equivalent market value of the live animals from which such imported pork and pork products were derived in line with
the market values of domestic porcine animals. This proposed rule also would revise the Harmonized Tariff System
(HTS) numbers which identify imported live porcine animals, pork, and pork products to conform with recent changes
in these numbers made by the United States Customs Service (USCS). These proposed changes will facilitate the continued
collection of assessments on imported porcine animals, pork, and pork products. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive 
Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This proposal is not intended to have a retroactive effect. The Act states that
the statute is intended to occupy the field of promotion and consumer education involving pork and pork products and
of obtaining funds thereof from pork producers and that the regulation of such activity (other than a regulation or
requirement relating to a matter of public health or the provision of State or local funds for such activity) that is
in addition to or different from the Act may not be imposed by a State. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under  1625
of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, a provision of
such order or an obligation imposed in connection with such order is not in accordance with law; and requesting a modification
of the order or an exemption from the order. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States
in the district in which person resides or does business has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination,
if a complaint is filed not later 
than 20 days after the date such person receives notice of such determination. 
This action also was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The effect of 
the Order upon small entities was discussed in the September 5, 1986, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 31898), and it was determined that the Order would not have a significant effect upon a substantial number of
small entities. Many importers may be classified as small entities. This proposed rule would increase the amount
of assessments on imported pork and pork products subject to assessment by two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as
expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of a cent per kilogram. Adjusting the assessments on imported pork
and pork products would result in an estimated increase in assessments of $143,000 over a 12-month period. Accordingly,
the Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This proposed rule would also revise HTS numbers for imported porcine animals, pork, and
pork products subject to assessment from 11 digits to 10 digits to conform a change in those HTS numbers made by USCS.
The change made in the number of digits in HTS numbers is merely a technical change and will not impose any new requirements
on importers. 
The Act (7 U.S.C. 4801-4819) approved December 23, 1985, authorized the establishment of a national pork promotion,
research, and consumer information program. The program was funded by an initial assessment rate of 0.25 percent
of the market value of all porcine animals marketed in the United States and an equivalent amount of assessment on imported
porcine animals, pork, and pork products. However, that rate was increased to 0.35 percent effective December 1,
1991 (56 FR 51635). The final Order establishing a pork promotion, research, and consumer information program was
published in the 
September 5, 1986, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 31898; as corrected, at 51 FR 36383 and amended at 53 FR 1909, 53 FR 30243, 56 FR 4, and 56 FR 51635) and assessments
began on November 1, 1986.

The Order requires importers of porcine animals to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35 percent of the
animal's declared value and importers of pork and pork products to pay USCS, upon importation, the assessment of 0.35
percent of the market value of the live porcine animals from which such pork and pork products were produced. This proposed
rule would increase the assessments on all of the imported pork and pork products subject to assessment listed in 7
CFR 1230.110 (September 8, 1993; 58 FR 47205). This increase is consistent with the increase in the annual average
price of domestic barrows and gilts for calendar year 1993 as reported by USDA, AMS, Livestock and Grain Market News
(LGMN) Branch. This increase in assessments would make the equivalent market value of the live porcine animal from
which the imported pork and pork products were derived reflect the recent increase in the market value of domestic
porcine animals, thereby promoting comparability between importer and domestic assessments. This proposed rule
would not change the current assessment rate of 0.35 percent of the market value. 
The methodology for determining the per-pound amounts 
for imported pork and pork products was described in the Supplementary Information accompanying the Order and published

in the September 5, 1986, 

Federal Register

 at 51 FR 31901. The weight of imported pork and pork products is converted to a carcass weight equivalent by utilizing
conversion factors 
which are published in the USDA Statistical Bulletin No. 616 ``Conversion Factors and Weights and Measures.'' These
conversion factors take into account the removal of bone, weight lost in cooking or other processing, and the nonpork
components of pork products. Secondly, the carcass weight equivalent is converted to a live animal equivalent weight
by dividing the carcass weight equivalent by 70 percent, which is the average dressing percentage of porcine animals
in the United States. Thirdly, the equivalent value of the live porcine animal is determined 
by multiplying the live animal equivalent weight by an annual average market price for barrows and gilts as reported
by USDA, AMS, LGMN Branch. The annual average price, which was based on price data from seven major markets, is now based
on only six markets. One of the seven markets_Kansas City_closed in 1991; and thus the 1992 and 1993 annual average
prices are based on price data from only six markets. This average price is published on a yearly basis during the month
of January in LGMN Branch's publication ``Livestock, Meat, and Wool Weekly Summary and Statistics.'' Finally, the
equivalent value is multiplied by the applicable assessment rate of 0.35 percent due on imported pork and pork products.
The end result is expressed in an amount per pound for each type of pork or pork product. To determine the amount per kilogram
for pork and pork products subject 
to assessment under the Act and Order, the cent-per-pound assessments are multiplied by a metric conversion factor
2.2046 and carried to the sixth decimal. 
The formula in the preamble for the Order at 51 FR 31901 contemplated that it would be necessary to recalculate the equivalent
live animal value of imported pork and pork products to reflect changes in the annual average price of domestic barrows
and gilts to maintain equity of assessments between domestic porcine animals and imported pork and pork products.
 
The average annual market price increased from $42.11 in 1992 to $45.32 in 1993, an increase of about 7 percent. This
increase would result in a corresponding increase in assessments for all HTS numbers listed in the table in  1230.110
of an amount equal to two-hundredths of a cent per pound, or as expressed in cents per kilogram, four-hundredths of
a cent per kilogram. Based on the most recent available Department of Commerce, Bureau of Census, data on the total
dollar value of imported pork and pork products subject to the assessment in 1993 the proposed increase in assessment
amounts would result in an estimated $143,000 increase in assessments over a 12-month period. 
USCS recently revised HTS numbers to conform with changes in importation procedures. The change is only a minor technical
change which revises all HTS numbers for live porcine animals, pork, and pork products listed in the table found at
 1230.110 (58 FR 47205) by changing them from 11 digit numbers to 10 digit numbers by dropping the last digit.
The live porcine animals, pork, and pork products subject to assessment and HTS article descriptions listed in a chart
contained in the Supplementary Information section on page 15914 of the final rule (54 FR 15914) would not change.
A comparison of the 11 digit numbers and the proposed 10 digit numbers are listed in the following chart.

This change would permit USCS to continue to collect assessments due on imported live porcine animals, pork, and pork
products in conjunction with its regular importation processing and collection system.

Department of Agriculture Guidelines for the Donation of Excess Research Equipment


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Operations, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rulemaking sets forth uniform procedures for the donation of excess research equipment to educational
institutions and nonprofit organizations for the conduct of technical and scientific education and research activities
as authorized by section 11(i) of the Stevenson/Wydler Technology Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This document includes not only the Department of Agriculture (USDA) procedures to implement 15 U.S.C. 3710(i) but
also draws upon the General Services Administration (GSA) regulations concerning the disposal of excess personal
property. However, because of the limited ability at the Office of Operations (00) to change the portions of this Part
that reflect GSA policy, comments on those portions are not appropriate for this proposed rulemaking.



Paperwork Reduction


Except for the gift/Acceptance Agreement contained in the appendix to the proposed rulemaking, the forms necessary
to implement these procedures have been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the
Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3500 

et seq

. The Gift/Acceptance Agreement has been submitted to OMB for clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act.


Classification


This rule will has been reviewed under Executive Order No. 12866, and it has been determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 mllion or more or adversely and
materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. This rule will not create any serious inconsistencies or otherwise
interfere with any actions taken or planned by another agency. It will not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs and does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order No. 12866. In addition, it will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act,
5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.
The following is given in compliance with Executive Order No. 12778. All State and local laws and regulations that
are in conflict with his rule are preempted. No retroactive effect is to be given to this rule. This rule does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.


Regulatory Analysis


Not required for this rulemaking.


Environmental Impact Statement


This proposed rule does not significantly affect the environment. Therefore, an environmental impact statement
is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.


Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance


Not required for this rulemaking.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This proposed rule would amend agency regulations by requiring Immigration Judge to enter an order of deportation
or exclusion, without a hearing, if satisfied that the alien voluntarily entered into a plea-negotiated or otherwise
stipulated request for an order of deportation or exclusion. It further codifies the practice of Immigration Judges
conducting telephone hearings in deportation, exclusion, or rescission cases, and codifies the authority of the
Immigration Judge to hold video teleconferenced hearings.



The proposed rule also clarifies regulatory language to conform with 

in absentia 

hearing provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act (the ``Act'').

This proposed rule amends 8 CFR 3.25 by requiring the Immigration Judge, under new subparagraph (b), to enter an order
of deportation or exclusion on the written record, without an in-person hearing, based upon the stipulated written
request of the respondent/applicant and the government, provided that the Immigration Judge determines that the
charging document sets forth a valid basis for deportability or excludability; the stipulated request for an order
of deportation or exclusion is voluntarily entered into by the respondent/applicant; and the respondent/applicant
specifically waives relief from deportation or exclusion as well as the described hearing rights. The requirements
that the Immigration Judge enter the order without a hearing is limited to cases in which the applicant or respondent
was represented at the time of the stipulation. The stipulation must be signed on behalf of the government and by both
the applicant or respondent and his or her attorney or other representative qualified under part 292 of this chapter.




This procedure codifies the litigation practice in some jurisdictions where, if a party enters into a stipulated
request for a deportation or exclusion order with a written waiver of his or her appearance and rights, the Immigration
Judge may sign the order of deportation or exclusion based upon the written record. This practice facilitates judicial
efficiency in uncontested cases. For example, it has been used to expedite departure shortly after the sentencing
of aliens convicted of offenses rendering them immediately deportable or excludable. Whereas this practice currently
occurs at the discretion of the Immigration Judge, the proposed rule would make it mandatory.

The procedure also has been used by imprisoned criminal aliens having no apparent avenue of relief from deportation
or exclusion who, after consultation with counsel, wish to avoid further detention pending deportation or exclusion
proceedings following release from prison. While protecting the rights of the parties, the rule also implements
the statutory requirement of expeditious deportation of criminal aliens under 8 U.S.C. 1252(i), 1252a(d). If used
more widely by litigants and criminal prosecutors, the procedure could alleviate overcrowded federal, state, and
local detention facilities and eliminate the need to calendar such uncontested cases on crowded immigration court
dockets. The procedure is not limited to cases arising from the criminal context and can be used in other appropriate
settings.

New subparagraph (c) establishes the authority of Immigration Judges to hold telephonic hearings. Although the
proposal is meant to be applicable nationwide, 

Purba

 v. 

INS,

 884 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1988), holds that telephonic deportation hearings may only be conducted with the consent of
the parties. This is in conflict with the proposed regulation, which permits telephonic hearings to be conducted
at the discretion of the Immigration Judge. The Immigration Judges in the geographical confines the Ninth Circuit
currently follow 

Purba

 and will continue to follow the law of the circuit if the proposed rule is finally adopted. In all areas outside the Ninth
Circuit the regulation would be effective and telephonic hearings would be conducted when an Immigration Judge,
in his or her sound discretion, deems it appropriate. Subparagraph (c) also codifies the authority of Immigration
Judges to hold video teleconferenced hearings. This practice increases administrative efficiency.

The proposed rule also makes minor technical changes in subparagraph (a) to conform with the 

in absentia

 provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1252.

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule establishes an alternative procedure for filing proof of fee payment for appeals of Immigration
Judge decisions to the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board). It provides added flexibility in the appeal filing procedure
by permitting a respondent/applicant to certify that a fee was forwarded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(Service). It further allows thirty (30) days from the date of filing the appeal for the respondent/applicant to submit
a fee receipt. It also provides that failure to present proof of payment of fee will cause the appeal to be deemed improperly
filed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposed rule provides a flexible alternative to the existing procedure of filing appeals of Immigration Judge
decisions before the Board of Immigration Appeals. The current procedure mandates that a timely filed notice of appeal
include a copy of a fee receipt or a fee waiver application. The proposed alternative procedure would allow the filing
of an appeal of the Immigration Judge's decision to the Board with a certification stating that the fee has been forwarded
to the Service. A sample certification follows the proposed rule. The respondent/applicant would then have thirty
(30) days from the date of filing the notice of appeal to obtain and file a copy of the fee receipt. This alternate procedure
may be particularly useful when the respondent/applicant is located a great distance from a Service office or is in
a custodial setting. This alternate procedure provides additional flexibility for such a person by creating a thirty
(30) day window of time, in which he or she may submit proof of payment of the appropriate fee for an appeal. It also preserves
the current appeal filing deadline and fee filing procedures.





This rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866. Nor does this
rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive
Order No. 12612. The rule meets the applicable standards provided in section 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No.
12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule will not: (1) Preempt any state or local laws, regulations
or policies; (2) have any retroactive effect or require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit
challenging the provisions of this rule.

Procedure for Automatic Termination of Temporary Resident Status upon Final Order of Deportation or Exclusion



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend existing regulations by providing, in specified circumstances, for the automatic
termination of temporary resident status under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) upon the
entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion. This amendment is necessary to avoid possible delays in, or termination
of, pending deportation and exclusion proceedings that would result if the Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS or Service) were required to follow the existing procedures for the termination of temporary resident status.
This amendment would permit the expeditious deportation and removal of aliens who hold temporary resident status,
but who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, or who have been found to be ineligible for admission into the United
States for reasons that are not waivable. This rule would also prevent the release of dangerous criminal liens into
society during deportation or exclusion proceedings.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposed regulation is necessary in order to correct a procedural anomaly that has resulted in the release of
aggravated felons who hold temporary resident status and has impaired the ability of the INS to deport those who, after
obtaining temporary resident status, commit deportable acts.



The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held in 

Matter of Medrano, 

Interim Decision 

#

3138 (BIA September 10, 1990), that the status of a lawful temporary resident alien who commits a deportable offense
must be terminated pursuant to  245A(b) (2) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(b)(2)), and in accordance with 8 CFR 245a.2(u),
before commencement of deportation proceedings. By following this precedent, INS is unable to detain deportable
aliens, such as those who commit aggravated felonies, who hold temporary resident status, without first stripping
the alien of his or her temporary resident status.



Medrano's 

interpretation of 8 CFR 244a.2(u)(2) confronts the INS with conflicting obligations. On the one hand,  242(a)(2)(A)
of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1252(a)(2)(A)) requires the INS to detain any alien convicted of an aggravated felony and  242
of the Act generally establishes the procedure for apprehension and deportation of aliens. On the other hand, 

Medrano 

stands as an obstacle to detaining and deporting such individuals until the alien's temporary residency status is
revoked.



Medrano 

and 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(2) also grant more procedural rights to temporary residents_who must first have their status
revoked_than to lawful permanent residents, who may simply be deported upon the commission of an aggravated felony,
without first terminating their status.

The proposed amendment harmonizes with other provisions of 8 CFR 245a.2(u)(1), which it will amend. This section
currently provides, in part:




The status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence under section 245(a)(1) of the Act may be terminated
at any time in accordance with section 245A(b)(2) of the Act. It is not necessary that a final order of deportation be
entered in order to terminate temporary resident status.




Accordingly, the existing regulation contemplates that institution of deportation proceedings may precede termination
of resident status.

The proposed regulation will correspond to regulations currently in force with respect to Special Agricultural
Workers. Special Agricultural Workers' temporary resident status is automatically revoked upon the entry of a final
order of deportation or exclusion. 8 CFR 210.4(d) (promulgated pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1160(a)(3)).

Moreover, in other contexts, courts have recognized that deportation entails loss of lawful resident status. See,


e.g., Marti-Xiques 

v. 

INS, 

741 F.2d 350 (11th Cir. 1984); 

Matter of Diaz-Chambrot, 

19 I. & N. Dec. 674 (BIA 1988) at 675.

Thus, in order to avoid any delay or termination of deportation or exclusion proceedings that may be caused by invoking
the termination procedure prescribed in  245a.2(u)(2)(i), and to permit the expeditious deportation and
removal of aggravated felons as required by sections 242A(d) and 242(i) of the Act, the INS proposes to add a new paragraph
(ii) to  245a.2(u)(2), to provide for the institution of deportation or exclusion proceedings and the automatic
termination of lawful resident status upon the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion in cases where: (1)
the ground for deportation arises under section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)(A)(iii)) (convicted
aggravated felons); or (2) the ground of deportability arises after the acquisition of temporary resident status,
and that ground may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1255a(d)(2)(B)(ii))
(relating to certain crimes, drug offenses, national security, and likelihood of becoming a public charge); or (3)
the alien seeks admission, and the ground of inadmissibility may not be waived pursuant to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii)
of the Act.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant
adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It will affect certain individual aliens, not
small entities. This is not a significant rule within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does
this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with
Executive Order 12612.

) If the ground for exclusion arises after the acquisition of temporary resident status and is not waivable pursuant
to section 245A(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act. 
(B) In such cases, the entry of a final order of deportation or exclusion automatically will terminate an alien's temporary
resident status acquired under section 245A(a)(1) of the Act.

Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' regulations to provide that
United States origin health certificates include all test results, certifications, or other statements required
by the foreign country of destination. This action appears necessary to ensure that the origin health certificate
contains all of the information required by the foreign country of destination. We are also proposing to amend the
requirements concerning scrapie for sheep and goats intended for export. This action would clarify the regulations
and make the terminology used in the export regulations consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations.
We are also proposing to revise one definition in the domestic scrapie regulations to make the definitions in those
regulations consistent with each other. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations provide, among
other things, that all animals intended for exportation to a foreign country, except animals intended for exportation
to Mexico or Canada and cattle from Mexico imported into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return
to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin of the export movement to the port of embarkation by an origin
health certificate. All animals intended for exportation to Mexico or Canada, except cattle from Mexico imported
into the United States in bond for temporary feeding and return to Mexico, must be accompanied from the State of origin
of the export movement to the border of the United States by an origin health certificate. 

The regulations state that the origin health certificate shall certify that the animals were inspected within the
30 days prior to the date of the movement of the animals for export, and were found to be sound, healthy, and free from
evidence of communicable disease and exposure to communicable disease. The origin health certificate, issued by
an Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) representative or an accredited veterinarian, must be endorsed
by an authorized APHIS veterinarian in the State of origin. The origin health certificate must also include any test
results added by the authorized APHIS veterinarian pursuant to 9 CFR 161.3, which allows test results to be added to
an origin health certificate after it is issued or signed by an accredited veterinarian. (Because of a typographical
error, the reference in part 91 is to `` 161.2.'' As part of this proposed rule, this reference would be corrected.)
The origin health certificate must individually identify the animals in the shipment as to species, breed, sex, and
age, and, if applicable, must also show registration name and number, tattoo markings, or other natural or acquired
markings. 

In addition to the information described in the preceding paragraph, a foreign country of destination may require
that its health requirements be added to the origin health certificate. Because these requirements are not imposed
by the United States, and may vary from export to export depending on the requirements of the destination country,
they are not set out in our regulations. However, unless all information required by a foreign government is included
on the origin health certificate, that animal may be refused entry into the foreign country upon export. To help prevent
the return of animals to the United States because they were refused entry in another country, we are proposing to amend
 91.3 to require that the origin health certificate include any test results, certifications, or other statements
required by the foreign country of destination.

Exportation of Sheep and Goats 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 91 also set forth the conditions under which sheep and goats are eligible for exportation
with regard to scrapie. Scrapie is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of sheep and goats.
The signs that become manifest may include nervousness, incoordination, slight muscular tremors, visible weight
loss, lack of luster in the animal's wool, and itching. Infected animals become debilitated and die. 

The regulations in   91.6(a)(3) and 91.8(a) provide that a goat or sheep shall not be exported if it is affected
with or exposed to scrapie; if it originated from, or has been on, any premises which then were infected or source flock
premises; if it is the progeny, sire or dam, or full or half brother or sister of any animal found to be affected with scrapie;
or if it was moved from premises located in an area quarantined for scrapie. 

Under the current regulations, infected premises are those on which an animal has been found to be infected with scrapie,
and source flock premises are those premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior
to showing signs of scrapie. 

When the 18-month time period was established for source flocks, existing biological evidence indicated that the
incubation period for scrapie was less than 18 months. Therefore, flocks from which an affected animal was moved more
than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie were not considered to be at risk from the scrapie-affected animal.
However, evidence now available indicates that scrapie develops more slowly than previously thought, with an incubation
period that could last for years, and that averages more than 18 months. Therefore, a flock from which a sheep or goat
was moved more than 18 months prior to showing signs of scrapie could be at risk from the affected animal. We are therefore
proposing to amend   91.6 and 91.8 by removing footnote 4, which refers to source flock premises as those
premises from which an affected animal was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs of scrapie, and to define
``source flock'' as defined below. 

We are proposing to amend   91.6 and 91.8 to prohibit the exportation of scrapie positive animals and all
animals from infected flocks, source flocks, and trace flocks, as defined in both 9 CFR part 54 (which describes the
Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program in place in the United States) and 9 CFR part 79 (which imposes interstate
movement restrictions for sheep and goats). We are also proposing to prohibit the exportation of exposed animals,
as defined in part 79, and to amend the definition of 

scrapie-exposed animals

 in part 54 to update it and make it consistent with the definition of 

exposed animal

 in part 79. The definitions of 

exposed animal, infected flock, scrapie-positive animal, source flock, 

and 

trace flock, 

as set forth in part 79 and part 54 (except for 

exposed animal

), are as follows: 



Exposed animal.

 Any animal which has been in the same flock at the same time within the previous 60 months as a scrapie-positive animal,
excluding limited contacts. Limited contacts are contacts between animals that occur off the premises of the flock,
and do not occur during or immediately after parturition for any of the animals involved. Limited contacts do not include
commingling (when animals concurrently share the same pen or same section in a transportation unit where there is
uninhibited physical contact). 



Infected Flock

. Any flock in which a Veterinary Services representative or State representative has determined an animal to be a
scrapie-positive animal. A flock will no longer be an infected flock after it has completed the requirements of a flock
plan. 



Scrapie-positive animal

. An animal for which a diagnosis of scrapie has been made by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, United
States Department of Agriculture, or another laboratory authorized by the Administrator to conduct scrapie tests
in accordance with (9 CFR part 79), through histological examination of central nervous system samples from the animal
for microscopic lesions in the form of neuronal vacuoles or spongy degeneration, or by the use of protease-resistant
protein analysis or other confirmation techniques used in conjunction with histological examination. 



Source flock

. A flock in which a Veterinary Services representative has determined that at least two animals, that were diagnosed
as scrapie-positive animals at an age of 54 months or less, were born. In order to be a source flock, the second scrapie-positive
diagnosis must be made within 60 months of the first scrapie-positive diagnosis. A flock will no longer be considered
a source flock after it has completed the requirements of a flock plan.

We consider each of the flocks and animals described in these definitions to pose a risk of transmitting scrapie. The
proposed changes to the regulations would both ensure that such animals are not exported, and make the terminology
used in part 91 consistent with that used in our domestic scrapie regulations. 
We are making several other changes to the export provisions in 
  91.6(a) and 91.8(a). As noted above, those paragraphs prohibit the export of a sheep or goat if it was
moved from premises located in an area quarantined for scrapie, or if it is the progeny, sire or dam, or full or half brother
or sister of any animal found to be affected with scrapie. 
The prohibition of the export of sheep and goats from premises in a quarantined area is outdated. The provisions that
formerly were set forth in part 79 for quarantining areas in which scrapie exists have been replaced in part 54 with
a program focusing on individual flocks. Therefore, we are proposing to remove the prohibition, in   91.6(a)
and 91.8(a), of the export of sheep and goats from premises in an area quarantined for scrapie. 
We are also proposing to make nonsubstantive changes to the wording in 
  91.6(a) and 91.8(a). We would replace the words ``sire or dam'' with the word ``parent,'' and would replace
the words ``full or half brother or sister'' with the word ``sibling.'' 
Definition of 

Scrapie-Exposed Animals 

in 9 CFR part 54 
As noted above, the definition of 

scrapie-exposed animals 

in part 54 differs from the definition of 

exposed animals 

in part 79. The definition in part 54 reads as follows: 


Scrapie-exposed animals. 

Animals, other than affected or bloodline animals, in a flock in which an affected animal has been diagnosed by a Veterinary
Services representative or state representative. Animals in the flock are no longer considered exposed after they
are destroyed or upon the flock's release from surveillance by state animal health officials. 
This definition is outdated and does not reflect current practice. For instance, we no longer conduct a bloodline
program, nor is surveillance conducted under the current voluntary flock certification program. The definition
of 

exposed animal

 in part 79 (set forth above) was published as part of the current program, and does reflect current practice. Therefore,
we are proposing to amend  54.1 to remove the definition of 

scrapie-exposed animals

 and to add the same definition of 

exposed animal

 that appears in 
 79.1. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, we have performed an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact
of this proposed rule on small entities. This proposed rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. However, we do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential impacts. In
particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits or costs
from implementation of this proposed rule. 
Under 21 U.S.C. 105, 113, 120, 121, 612, 613, and 614, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to promulgate regulations
to require inspection and certification of animals intended for export from the United States, and to take other measures
to prevent the exportation of diseased livestock. 
Under this proposed rule, we would require that the origin health certificate required for animals exported from
the United States include any test results, certifications, or other statements required by the foreign country
of destination. Under this proposed rule, we would also revise the export regulations in   91.6(a)(3)
and 91.8(a) to make them consistent with the regulations in 9 CFR parts 54 and 79 regarding the Voluntary Scrapie Flock
Certification Program. 
We anticipate the proposed changes involving certification will have little or no impact on small domestic exporters.
In order for exporters to sell their animals abroad, the animals must meet the import requirements of the country of
destination. Therefore, it is in the exporter's interest, even under the current regulations, to ensure that those
requirements are met. The proposed change would require only that the origin health certificate include all test
results, certifications, or other statements required by the country of destination. However, estimates of the
number of animals and the number of small entities that would be affected, and the potential costs to exporters, are
not available. 
The proposed changes concerning sheep and goats with regard to scrapie would affect some producers. Under the current
regulations in part 91, sheep and goats from source flock premises may not be exported, and source flock premises are
considered those from which an animal affected with scrapie was moved within 18 months or less prior to showing signs
of scrapie. 
Under the proposed regulations, the export of sheep and goats from source flocks would continue to be prohibited,
but the meaning of ``source flock'' would be revised to mean a flock in which at least two animals were diagnosed as scrapie-positive
animals at an age of 54 months or less, provided the second diagnosis was made within 60 months of the first, and provided
the requirements of a flock plan have not been completed. This change would make the regulations more restrictive,
and could increase the number of animals prohibited exportation because they originated in a source flock. However,
as of September 1993, there were only 8 source flocks in the United States. 


Although the proposed change would apply to both sheep and goats, at present the number of goats being exported is minimal.

There are approximately 92,500 sheep farms in the United States, with approximately 11 million sheep. The large majority
of these are small entities. Ninety-nine percent of the sheep farms in this country each have annual sales totalling
less than $500,000, and approximately 77,000 have fewer than 100 sheep. In 1992, there were approximately 830,000
sheep exported from the United States.

Renewable Energy Production Incentives

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and public hearing and request for public comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE) today proposes a rule to implement
a program in response to the requirements of section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to make incentive payments
to qualified renewable energy facilities. The proposed rule covers application procedures, qualification requirements,
calculation of incentive payments, and administrative remedies.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. 13317, requires the Department of Energy to make, subject to
the availability of appropriations, incentive payments to the owners or operators of qualified renewable energy
facilities for the production and sale of electric energy from certain renewable energy sources. With certain exceptions,
qualified renewable energy facilities are renewable energy conversion facilities (solar, wind, geothermal, or
biomass) owned by States, subdivisions of States, or nonprofit electrical cooperatives that generate electric
energy for sale. The goal of the incentive program is to advance the use of renewable energy conversion systems in the
United States, particularly those systems that use emerging technologies.

The payment rate begins at 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour, adjusted for fiscal year 1994 inflation over fiscal year 1993,
for energy produced in fiscal year 1994. For energy produced in subsequent years, payment rates will be similarly
adjusted annually to account for inflation. Payments may be made for 10 years only to owners or operators of qualified
facilities first put in service during the period beginning on October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. 
The stated purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, of which section 1212 is a part, are promotion of: ``
(1) Increases in the production and utilization of energy from renewable energy resources; (2) further advances
of renewable energy technologies; and (3) exports of United States renewable energy technologies.'' 42 U.S.C. 13311.

Section 1212 appears to be complementary to sections 1914 and 1916 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 1914 amended
the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour adjusted for inflation for electricity
produced from wind or from biomass derived from organic matter grown exclusively for use in generating electricity.
26 U.S.C. 45. Section 1916 amended the Internal Revenue Code to make permanent the energy investment tax credit for
non-utility investors in solar and geothermal property. 26 U.S.C. 48(a)(2). Sections 1914 and 1916 are designed
to assist in making certain emerging renewable energy technologies cost competitive. Section 1212 appears to have
a similar objective with regard to State instrumentalities and nonprofit electric cooperatives neither of which
can benefit from tax credits because they do not pay Federal income taxes. 


II. Description of Proposed Rule 


Proposed Section 451.1 


Proposed  451.1 defines the purpose and scope of part 451 as setting policies and procedures governing the administration
of the renewable energy production incentive program and the process for the payment of incentives. This proposed
section states that determinations with regard to incentive payments are not subject to the Department's general
financial assistance regulation in 10 CFR part 600. Those regulations deal with grants and cooperative agreements
that are awarded to stimulate assistance recipients to undertake certain future activities with Federal funds.
In contrast, the incentive payments under section 1212 are a reward for activities that have already taken place and
there is no stated restriction with regard to what the recipient does with the Federal funds received. 


Proposed Section 451.2 


Proposed  451.2 sets forth the definitions for part 451. The first defined term is ``closed-loop biomass''
which is based on the definition of the same term in section 1914. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, closed-loop
biomass energy facilities, in contrast to other eligible biomass energy facilities, would receive priority payment
in the event that Congress has not appropriated enough funds to make all incentive payments in any given fiscal year.

Proposed  451.2 defines the term ``fiscal year'' as the standard Federal fiscal year which runs from October
1 of any given year to September 30 of the next year. Section 1212 refers to fiscal years, but does not provide a definition.
In the absence of any legislative history to the contrary, Congress is assumed to have intended use of the standard
Federal fiscal year. 
Proposed  451.2 defines the term ``nonprofit electrical cooperative,'' which is one category of eligible
owners named in section 1212. The proposed definition is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with tax exempt organizations and on information provided by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
The Department invites comments on the adequacy of this definition and related suggestions for editing. 
Although section 1212 does not use the term ``renewable energy source,'' or any other term, to characterize the eligible
energy sources, the Department has found it useful at various points in the proposed rule. The definition is based
on the list of energy sources in paragraph (b) of section 1212 which refers to ``solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal
energy.'' 42 U.S.C. 13317(b). It is also based on the list of excepted (and therefore ineligible) energy sources in
subparagraphs (b)(1) (municipal solid waste) and (b)(2) (certain dry steam geothermal energy). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b)
(1), (2). Wind and biomass are indirect forms of solar energy. The specification of those two indirect forms as well
as the word ``solar'' suggests that Congress meant the word ``solar'' to include only direct forms of solar energy,
namely, solar heat (concentrated solar insulation for a solar thermal electric facility) and solar light (concentrated
or unconcentrated solar insulation for a solar photovoltaic electric facility). That reading is supported by the
facts with regard to indirect forms of solar energy. Indirect forms of solar energy other than wind and biomass (e.g.,
hydropower) are either fully competitive with fossil fuels without need of an incentive payment or are at a development
stage such that an incentive payment could not make them cost competitive with fossil fuels.

Proposed  451.2 defines the term ``renewable energy facility'' which appears in section 1212. The key part
of the definition is the reference to ``a system or an integrated set of components'' which makes it clear that the facility
is mostly equipment such as heat exchangers or turbines and that the facility does not include the land on which it is
located. In addition, for geothermal facilities it does not include the geothermal field, and for biomass facilities
it does not include the biomass farm. The proposed definition also omits any reference to equipment for transmission
or use of electricity because the text of paragraph (b) of section 1212 which defines the term ``qualified renewable
energy facility,'' does not state that such a facility must include such equipment. It is important to note that the
definition refers to electric energy ``in whole or in part'' from a renewable energy source. That language takes account
of the likelihood that some facilities will produce electric energy in part from a non-renewable energy source such
as fossil fuel. 
Finally, proposed 451.2 defines the term ``State'' which is not defined in the text of section 1212. However, given
the above-quoted stated purpose of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress
meant for incentive payments to be available for power generation in any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, and any other territory or possession of the United States. This qualification is explicitedly set forth
in proposed  451.4(g) 


Proposed Section 451.3 


Proposed  451.3 deals with who is eligible to apply. Consistent with section 1212, it states that any owner or
operator of a qualified renewable energy facility may apply. However, it qualifies the word ``operator'' to make
clear that such a person or entity must have the written consent of the owner. A contractual provision would suffice,
but it is not the only written manifestation of owner consent that would be acceptable. This provision will enable
the Department to avoid a situation where both the owner and operator of a facility apply. 


Proposed Section 451.4 


Proposed  451.4 answers the question: What is a qualified renewable energy facility? Proposed paragraph (a)
tracks section 1212 by providing that various State instrumentalities or a nonprofit electric cooperative must
be the owner. 
Proposed paragraph (b) clarifies an ambiguity in section 1212 with regard to what constitutes ownership. In light
of the possibility that the facilities of nonprofit electric cooperative may be financed, the Department worded
proposed paragraph (b) to cover situations in which the cooperative has all rights to the beneficial use of the qualified
renewable energy facility, but legal title is held by a financing source for the benefit of the cooperative. The Department
invites comments on the adequacy of proposed paragraph (b) in light of experience with the title aspects of financing
arrangements. 
Proposed paragraph (c) tracks the language of section 1212 by requiring that the electricity generated must be ``for
sale in, or affecting, interstate commerce among the States.'' The Department is inclined to interpret the word ``sale''
to mean a transaction between two entities, who may be related, involving the transfer of electric energy for consideration.
Thus, electric energy generated by an entity for internal use by that entity would not constitute a ``sale.'' 
Proposed paragraph (d) restates that only ``renewable energy sources'' as defined by proposed  451.2 are covered.

Proposed paragraph (e) lists the types of biomass and geothermal energy sources specifically excluded by section
1212. This paragraph reflects the provisions of section 1212(b)(1) and (2). 42 U.S.C. 13317(b)(1) and (2). 
Proposed paragraph (f) tracks the provision of section 1212 which requires that the facility must first be used during
the period beginning with October 1, 1993, and ending on September 30, 2003. 
In addition, the Department considered inclusion of a requirement that, to be considered qualified for receipt of
incentive payments, a facility must be purchased and installed without financial assistance from other federal
programs. The requirement was omitted from this proposed rule because of uncertainty regarding the total breadth
and form of federal programs that might be applicable to facility design, construction, installation, and operation.
The Department will consider this possibility further and invites comments on the advisability of such a requirement.

Proposed Section 451.5 


Proposed  451.5 deals with where and when to apply. Proposed paragraph (a) permits the filing of an application
only in response to an annual notice in the 

Federal Register

. Issuance of that notice should closely follow enactment of appropriations. Proposed paragraph (b) concerns the
initial application. It provides that such an application may be filed in the first fiscal year following that in which
electricity eligible for incentive payments is first generated, and that subsequent applications may be filed in
the fiscal years following those in which electricity eligible for incentive payments is generated. 


Proposed Section 451.6 


Consistent with the requirements of section 1212, proposed  451.6 provides that the Department may only make
incentive payments for a 10-fiscal year period to any particular qualified renewable facility. 


Proposed Section 451.7 


Proposed  451.7 describes metering requirements which the Department thinks are desirable to promote the
accuracy and veracity of applications for incentive payments. In all cases, the number of kilowatt-hours generated
and sold is to be metered. If non-qualifying renewable or non-renewable energy sources as well as qualifying renewable
energy sources are used, proposed  451.7 would not require electrical metering of sources where such is not
possible or practical. In such cases, the kilowatt hours attributable to the qualified renewable energy source must
usually be calculated from fractions of heat input, or other energy input, from the several sources. Such inputs must
be metered, measured, or otherwise quantified from the respective raw energy streams using commonly accepted (and
identified) procedures and conversion methodologies. 


Proposed Section 451.8 


Proposed  451.8 sets forth application content requirements. 
Most of the requirements are self-explanatory. However, several of them deserve some discussion to focus them for
public comment. 
Proposed paragraph (f) would require: ``That components and equipment, representing at least 50 percent of the capital
cost of the qualified renewable energy facility, were substantially manufactured in a State.'' This provision is
consistent with the purposes of title XII of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is modeled on a provision of section 6 of
the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Technology Competitiveness Act of 1989, as amended by title XII of the
Energy Policy Act of 1992. 42 U.S.C.  12005(b)(1)(B). Like section 6, it would not exclude entities merely on
the basis of foreign ownership. It would promote domestic jobs and production without discriminating against foreign
entities that invest in production facilities in the United States. 

Proposed paragraphs (g) and (h) would require independently audited and certified statements of the monthly and
annual electric energy generated and sold. The content of the certification should be similar to the type of certification
supplied by an accounting firm in a company's annual report to shareholders. Paragraph (h) also describes the calculation
necessary when the metered number of kilowatt-hours represents electric energy generated from renewable and non-renewable
or excluded-renewable energy sources. The proposed requirement for an independently audited and certified statement
will minimize the chance of erroneous claims and the need for DOE audits. 
Consistent with applicable regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 5 CFR 1320.6(f), proposed paragraph
(k) would require a statement agreeing to retain records for a period of three years to provide for prompt access to,
or copies of, such records in response to a written request by DOE. DOE is still considering whether the retention period
should be the entire ten year period during which incentive payments may be collected. DOE did not propose a longer
retention period because the proposed audit and certification requirements would make fraud or mistake unlikely.



Proposed Section 451.9 


Proposed  451.9 describes DOE's procedures for processing applications for incentive payments including
the statutory formula for initially calculating the amount due and the adjustment for inflation. DOE is proposing
a procedure to deal with the possibility that there could be a shortage of appropriations to make the full incentive
payments. The President's annual budget request and Congressional action on that request will precede receipt of
the applications in every year. It is therefore unlikely that Congress will appropriate precisely the amount necessary
to make the full incentive payments. In the event that the amount appropriated is less than the amount required to make
full payments to all qualified applicants, the proposed procedure involves priority first (and, if necessary, pro
rata payments) to all owners or operators of solar, wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass facilities, and priority
second (and, if necessary, pro rata payments) to owners or operators of all other qualified facilities. This procedure
favors emerging technologies which are similarly favored by the tax credit provisions of sections 1914 and 1916.
These technologies are close to or in early commercialization stages where the incentive payments can help speed
the commercialization process. If payments are reduced as a result of a shortage of appropriations, the kilowatt-hours
attributable to the shortfall will accrue for payment in succeeding years to the extent that Congress appropriates
funds sufficient to allow payment for these accruals together with other eligible electricity production. 


Proposed Section 451.10

DOE is proposing an administrative remedy for those aggrieved by the initial decision of the DOE Deciding Official
who will be the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In order to exhaust administrative
remedies, it will be necessary to appeal to DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals. This procedure has two virtues. It
would be less expensive than pursuing a judicial remedy immediately. It would also ensure that DOE has made a record
which is appropriate for judicial review in the event a petition for review is filed in a federal court. 



III. Regulatory Review 


DOE has concluded that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria which define
such actions under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735, and is therefore exempt from regulatory review. Accordingly,
no clearance of this proposed rule by the Office of Management and Budget is required. 


IV. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, which requires
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental
jurisdictions. DOE has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small entities because
the rule directly affects only qualified renewable energy facilities owned by state or local governments or non-profit
electrical cooperatives, and such facilities are not deemed small entities. 


V. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 


New information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and recordkeeping
requirements are proposed by this rulemaking. Accordingly, this notice has been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget for review and approval of paperwork requirements. Earlier in this notice, DOE described the application
content proposed for use under the rule. The information DOE proposes to collect on the applications for incentive
payments is necessary to determine whether the applicant is qualified for payment. The frequency of the information
collection is monthly for those entities eligible to apply for incentive payments. It is estimated that less than
40 entities will apply for incentive payments in the first year, growing to less than 200 over a ten year period. 
The public reporting burden is estimated to average 25 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and retrieving the collection
of information. The collection of information contained in this proposed rule is considered the least burdensome
for the Department of Energy's functions to comply with the legal requirements and achieve program objectives. However,
comments are requested concerning the accuracy of the estimated paperwork reporting burden, in addition to the proposed
record retention requirement discussed above. 



VI. Review Under Executive Order 12612 


Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National
Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government.
If there are sufficient substantial effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment
to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing policy action. This proposed rule establishes
an incentive program under which state owned renewable energy facilities may qualify for incentive payments based
on the amount of electric energy the facility generates using specified renewable sources for sale in, or affecting
interstate commerce. The Department has determined that since the generation of electricity is not a primary function
of a State, the proposed rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States.

VII. Review Under Executive Order 12778 


Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations.
These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity,
drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected legal
conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable
effort to ensure that the regulation describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review
and any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that the proposed rule meets the
requirements of section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 



VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 


DOE has determined that promulgation of this proposed rule falls within the procedural rulemaking class, Category
A6 of Appendix A to Subpart D, ``Categorical Exclusions Applicable to General Agency Actions'', of the DOE National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. 10 CFR part 1021. It is therefore categorically excluded from preparation
of either an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement under the NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321, et. seq).




IX. Opportunities for Public Comment 


A. Written Comment Procedures 


Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or comments with respect
to the proposed rulemaking. 
Twelve copies of written comments should be submitted to the address indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice and must be received by the date indicated in the DATES section of this notice. Comments should
be identified on the outside of the envelope and on the documents themselves with the designation ``REPI NOPR, Docket
No. EE-RM-94-301''. In the event any person wishing to provide written comments cannot provide
twelve copies, alternative arrangements can be made in advance with DOE. 
All written comments received will be available for public inspection as part of the administrative record on file
for this rulemaking in the Department of Energy Freedom of Information Office Reading Room at the address provided
at the beginning of this notice. If informal meetings or other contacts occur during this rulemaking, DOE may add a
memorandum to the record on file summarizing what transpired. 
Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential
and which may be exempt by law from public disclosure, should submit one complete copy of the document, as well as two
copies from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine
the confidential status of the information and to treat it according to its determination. 


B. Public Hearing 


1. Request to Speak Procedures 


A public hearing on the proposed rule will be held at the time and place indicated in the DATES and ADDRESSES Sections
of this notice. Any person who has an interest in the proposed rule or who is a representative of a group or class of persons
that has an interest in the proposed rule may request an opportunity to make an oral presentation. A request to speak
at the public hearing should be addressed to the address or phone number indicated at the beginning of this notice.
The person making the request should briefly describe his or her interest in the proceedings and, if appropriate,
state why the person is a proper representative of the group. The person should also provide a phone number where he
or she may be reached during the day. Each person selected to be heard will be notified by DOE as to the approximate time
they will be speaking. Twelve copies of the speaker's statement should be submitted at the hearing. In the event any
person wishing to testify cannot meet this requirement, alternative arrangements can be made in advance with DOE.

2. Conduct of the Hearing 



DOE reserves the right to select persons to be heard at the hearing, to schedule their respective presentations, and
to establish procedures governing the conduct of the hearing. The length of each presentation will be limited to 10
minutes or based on the number of persons requesting an opportunity to speak. 


A DOE official will preside at the hearing. This will not be a judicial or evidentiary-type hearing. It will be conducted
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 and section 501 of the Department of Energy Organization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7191. 


Questions may be asked only by those conducting the hearing. At the conclusion of all initial oral statements, each
person who has made an oral statement will be given the opportunity to make a rebuttal or clarifying statement. The
statements will be given in the order in which the initial statements were made and will be subject to time limitations.



Any further procedural rules needed for the proper conduct of the hearing will be announced by the presiding officer.



A transcript of the hearing will be made by DOE and made available as part of the administrative record for this rulemaking.
It will be on file for inspection at the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room at the address indicated at the beginning
of this notice. 


If DOE must cancel the public hearing, DOE will make every effort to publish an advance notice of such cancellation
in the 

Federal Register

. Actual notice of cancellation will also be given to all persons scheduled to speak. The hearing date may be canceled
in the event no member of the public requests the opportunity to make an oral presentation.

 Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (Corporation), by order of the Corporation Board, issues for public
comment proposed regulations to implement the requirements of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, relating to the receipt
and processing of requests for Corporation Privacy Act records, requests for amendment of records, fees to be charged,
procedures to be followed in processing requests for records, and criminal penalties.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which amended the Farm Credit Act of 1971, the Corporation was created,
among other things, to manage the Farm Credit Insurance Fund (Insurance Fund) which was established to ensure the
timely payment of principal and interest on insured notes, bonds, debentures, and other obligations issued on behalf
of the Farm Credit System (FCS) Banks. The Corporation must be appointed as the conservator or receiver for any FCS
institution placed into conservatorship or receivership by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) after January
5, 1993. The Corporation has the authority to examine, as it deems necessary, FCS banks, direct lender associations,
and FCS institutions in receivership. 


These proposed regulations set forth procedures to be used in requesting access to and responding to requests for
Corporation Privacy Act records. As required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), the Corporation is notifying the public of the proposed
regulations. They provide that all requests for access to Corporation Privacy Act records must be in writing and signed
by the subject of the record, adequately describe the material sought, and be sent to the Corporation in McLean, Virginia.
The proposed regulations delegate to the Privacy Act Officer authority to make initial determinations concerning
requests for access to records. The proposed regulations provide procedures for requests for amendment of records
and the appeal of an initial adverse determination on a request to amend a record. The proposed regulations also recite
the statutory bases for exemption from disclosure. Finally, the proposed regulations provide a fee structure.
Comments are sought on all the provisions contained in the regulations.

Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace; Thomaston, GA


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. A Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) Runway
30 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) for the Thomaston-Upson County Airport has recently been developed.
Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface of the earth is needed for instrument flight
rules (IFR) operations when utilizing this SIAP. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for IFR operators executing the developed SIAP. If approved, the operating status of the airport would
change from VFR operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Comments Invited


Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters
wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed,
stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ASO-8.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received before the specified
closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in
this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for Southern Region, room 530, 1701 Columbia Avenue, College Park, Georgia
30337, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact
with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.


Availability of NPRM'S


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Manager, System Management Branch (ASO-530), Air Traffic Division, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta,
Georgia 30320. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on
a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A which describes the
application procedure.


The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Thomaston, Georgia. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for
IFR operators executing the NDB Runway 30 SIAP to serve the Thomaston-Upson County Airport. The coordinates for this
airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective
September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the
Order. If approved, the operating status of the airport would be changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations
concurrent with publication of the SIAP.
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Influencing Legislation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains proposed regulations defining the phrase ``influencing legislation'' for purposes of the
deduction disallowance for certain amounts paid or incurred in connection with influencing legislation. These
regulations are necessary because of changes made to the Internal Revenue Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993. These rules will assist businesses and certain tax-exempt organizations in complying with the Internal
Revenue Code. This document also provides notice of a public hearing on these proposed regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



This document contains proposed Income Tax Regulations under section 162(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
(Code), as amended by section 13222 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993) (107 Stat. 477). These
proposed regulations relate to the definition of ``influencing legislation''. On December 27, 1993, a notice of
proposed rulemaking (IA-57-93) was published in the 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 68330) concerning the rules for allocating costs to certain activities, including influencing legislation.

Section 13222 of OBRA 1993 amended section 162(e) of the Code, concerning the deductibility of certain lobbying and
political expenditures. As amended, section 162(e)(1)(A) denies a deduction for amounts paid or incurred in connection
with influencing legislation. However, certain lobbying expenditures relating to local legislation are not subject
to section 162(e)(1)(A). In addition, section 162(e)(1)(D) denies a deduction for any amount paid or incurred in
connection with influencing certain federal executive branch officials. Section 162(e)(1)(B) and (C) continues
the rules disallowing business deductions for amounts paid or incurred in connection with grassroots lobbying and
participation in political campaigns. 
Section 162(e)(4)(A) defines ``influencing legislation'' as ``any attempt to influence any legislation through
communication with any member or employee of a legislative body, or with any government official or employee who may
participate in the formulation of legislation.'' Section 162(e)(5)(C) provides that ``[a]ny amount paid or incurred
for research for, or preparation, planning, or coordination of, any activity described in paragraph (1) [including
`influencing legislation'] shall be treated as paid or incurred in connection with such activity.'' The legislative
history of the amendment to section 162(e) indicates that attempts to influence legislation should be distinguished
from ``mere monitoring'' of legislative activities. The legislative history further provides, however, that if
a taxpayer monitors legislation and subsequently attempts to influence that or similar legislation, the monitoring
activity should generally be treated as ``in connection with'' the attempt to influence legislation (and, therefore,
the costs relating to that monitoring activity would be non-deductible).

Section 4911, relating to the excise tax on certain lobbying activities of certain electing public charities, contains
a definition of ``influencing legislation'' that is essentially identical (as it relates to direct, as opposed to
grassroots, lobbying) to the definition of that term in section 162(e)(4)(A). Because of this similarity, these
proposed regulations adopt rules that are similar to the rules applicable to direct lobbying communications under
 56.4911-2(b)(1). However, section 162(e) differs from section 4911 in certain material respects.
For example, section 4911(d)(2) contains exceptions to the term ``influencing legislation,'' while section 162(e)(4)
does not. Moreover, these proposed regulations under section 162(e) and the regulations under section 4911 differ
in some respects due to the nature of charitable organizations described in section 501(c)(3) as compared to, for
example, organizations described in section 501(c)(6) and for-profit entities. Accordingly, taxpayers should
not infer that these proposed regulations reflect an interpretation of section 4911 or the regulations thereunder.



Discussion of Selected Considerations 


The proposed regulations define ``influencing legislation'' in the same terms as the statutory definition in section
162(e)(4)(A), which requires a ``communication'' with a government official or employee. With respect to that communication,
the proposed regulations adopt rules similar to the rules in the section 4911 regulations. Those rules require that
the communication refer to specific legislation and reflect a view on that legislation. This approach was believed
to be more appropriate than a general facts and circumstances analysis because it provides reasonably objective
criteria for determining whether an attempt to influence legislation has been made. 
The proposed regulations also provide rules for determining which activities support a lobbying communication
and, therefore, are considered part of the attempt to influence legislation. The principal issue in this regard is
whether the mere fact that an activity is used in some manner to support a lobbying communication should be sufficient
to treat that activity as part of the attempt to influence legislation. This approach has been referred to by some commentators
as a ``lookback'' rule, in that lobbying activities would be identified solely by ``looking back'' from the lobbying
communication to those activities which supported it. While a lookback approach would appear to be consistent with
the legislative history, numerous comments suggested that the administrative burdens associated with a lookback
rule could be onerous, particularly if the period of the lookback were long or unlimited. Accordingly, these comments
recommended that a lookback rule not be adopted, or, if adopted, that it be limited to a brief period of time. Some of
the comments suggested that an appropriate period of time may be six months, by analogy to the limited lookback rule
applicable to certain grassroots lobbying activities under the section 4911 regulations. 
Upon consideration of the statute, its legislative history, and the comments received, it was concluded that a lookback
rule would not be appropriate. Instead, the proposed regulations provide that only those activities engaged in for
the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying communication will be treated as a lobbying activity. This approach
strikes an appropriate balance between taxpayers' need for greater contemporaneous certainty regarding whether
a particular activity may be treated as a lobbying activity, and Congress' objective of not allowing a deduction for
lobbying activities. 
Treasury and the IRS view the legislative history on this point as voicing a concern that taxpayers may attempt to abuse
an intent- or purpose-based rule by labelling their lobbying activities as ``mere monitoring.'' To protect against
that potential abuse, while also providing greater certainty regarding those activities that are less likely to
be lobbying activities, the proposed regulations provide presumptions regarding the purpose for engaging in certain
activities. 
Because the temporal connection between the lobbying communication and the related activity is an important factor
in assessing whether the related activity was engaged in for the purpose of supporting the lobbying communication,
the presumptions turn to a considerable extent on whether the activity occurred during the taxable year in which the
lobbying communication was made or the immediately preceding year. It was believed that the mere closing of the annual
accounting period was insufficient, in some cases, to affect this temporal connection, and, consequently, that
the presumption would need to operate in more than one annual accounting period. Thus it was believed that the presumption
period was an appropriate period during which to treat this temporal connection as indicating (rebuttably) the purpose
for engaging in the activity without creating significant difficulties for taxpayers in determining, at the time
they file their returns, whether the presumption is likely to operate with respect to that activity. 
The proposed regulations also address those supporting activities that are engaged in for both lobbying and non-lobbying
purposes. In this connection, some of the comments have suggested that a principal or primary purpose test be adopted.
Under this approach, an activity would be treated as influencing legislation if the principal or primary purpose
for engaging in that activity was to make or support a lobbying communication, even if the activity was engaged in for
other, non-lobbying purposes as well. Conversely, an activity would be treated as not involving lobbying if the principal
or primary purpose for engaging in that activity was a non-lobbying purpose, even though a substantial purpose of
the activity was to support lobbying.

After consideration, these suggestions have not been 
adopted. Instead, the proposed regulations require an activity 
that is engaged in for both lobbying and non-lobbying purposes to 
be treated as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose and 
partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the 
activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to 
influencing legislation under  1.162-28. This allocation 
approach was adopted rather than a principal or primary purpose 
test because a principal/primary purpose test does not avoid the 
necessity of determining the various purposes for engaging in an 
activity and weighing the relative importance of those purposes, 
and because it has a substantial ``cliff'' effect that an 
allocation approach does not. In those situations where the 
taxpayer has substantial lobbying and non-lobbying purposes, the 
results under a principal/primary purpose test would differ 
dramatically depending on one's views as to which of the purposes 
is dominant. As a result, Treasury and the IRS have serious 
concerns whether that test could be administered responsibly and 
fairly. Finally, nothing in section 162(e) or its legislative 
history indicates that Congress intended to treat activities 
engaged in for a substantial lobbying purpose as outside the 
scope of 162(e). 
Consideration was also given to treating an activity as 
influencing legislation if any substantial purpose for the 
activity is lobbying. Treasury and the IRS believe it generally 
would be easier to establish a substantial purpose for engaging 
in an activity, rather than examining all of the purposes to 
establish a principal/primary purpose. As a result, this 
approach would be easier to administer than a principal/primary 
purpose test. Moreover, a substantial purpose test would appear 
to be more consistent with Congressional intent to treat as 
influencing legislation those activities that in fact support a 
lobbying communication than would a principal/primary purpose 
test. However, Treasury and the IRS are concerned that this 
approach could be considerably over-inclusive, in that some 
activities engaged in predominantly for non-lobbying purposes 
would be treated entirely as non-deductible lobbying activities. 
The IRS invites comments, however, whether this approach would be 
more appropriate than the rule in the proposed regulations. 
Finally, to provide taxpayers greater certainty and relief 
from burdensome recordkeeping regarding certain relatively minor, 
recurring activities, the proposed regulations treat certain 
activities as engaged in solely for non-lobbying purposes. 


Explanation of Provisions 


Under the proposed regulations, as under section 
162(e)(4)(A), ``influencing legislation'' means any attempt to 
influence any legislation through a lobbying communication with 
any member or employee of a legislative body or any government 
official or employee (other than a member or employee of a 
legislative body) who may participate in the formulation of the 
legislation that the taxpayer desires to influence. A lobbying 
communication is a communication that either (i) refers to 
specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation, or 
(ii) clarifies, amplifies, modifies, or provides support for 
views reflected in a prior lobbying communication. Specific 
legislation includes both legislation that has already been 
introduced in a legislative body and a specific legislative 
proposal that the taxpayer either supports or opposes. 
An attempt to ``influence legislation'' means the lobbying 
communication and all activities, such as research, preparation, 
and other background activities, engaged in for a purpose of 
making or supporting the lobbying communication. Whether an 
activity is engaged in for this purpose is determined based on 
all the facts and circumstances. 
If a taxpayer engages in an activity both for a lobbying 
purpose and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer must 
treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying purpose 
and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division of the 
activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs to 
influencing legislation under  1.162-28. A taxpayer's allocation 
to influencing legislation of only the incremental amount of 
costs that would not have been incurred but for the lobbying 
purpose generally is not reasonable. Similarly, an allocation 
based on the number of purposes for engaging in an activity 
without regard to their relative importance also generally is not 
reasonable.

The proposed regulations presume that if an activity 
relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding
the 
taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made, that 
activity was engaged in for all periods solely for that non- 
lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption in 
part (it cannot be rebutted entirely because the presumption only 
operates if the taxpayer establishes that the activity has been 
engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose) by establishing that the 
activity was also engaged in for the purpose of making or 
supporting a lobbying communication. Thus, for example, if a 
taxpayer regularly conducts an activity in the ordinary course of 
its business operations beginning at least two taxable years 
before the taxable year in which the lobbying communication is 
made, it would be presumed that the continuing activity was not 
engaged in to support the lobbying communication, even during the 
taxable year in which the lobbying communication is made (and the 
preceding taxable year). In this regard, it is expected that 
whether a course of conduct spanning a period of time is a single 
activity will be determined based on all the facts and 
circumstances. In particular, it is expected that a substantial 
change in the way an activity is conducted will result in the 
revised activity being considered a separate activity from the 
earlier conduct of the activity. 
The proposed regulations also presume that if an activity 
relating to a lobbying communication was engaged in during the 
same taxable year as the communication is made or in the 
immediately preceding taxable year, and is not within the 
presumption described in the preceding paragraph, that activity 
was engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting that 
communication. The taxpayer may rebut this presumption (in whole 
or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in 
(entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. If, during 
the same taxable year, the taxpayer commences an activity that 
relates directly to the subject matter of specific legislation 
(then in existence) and makes a lobbying communication with 
respect to that legislation, it is expected that the taxpayer 
generally will be unable to rebut the presumption. 
The proposed regulations treat certain activities as engaged 
in without a purpose of making or supporting a lobbying 
communication. These activities consist of performing an 
activity for purposes of complying with the requirements of any 
law, reading any general circulation publications, or viewing or 
listening to other mass media communications available to the 
general public. In addition, if, prior to evidencing a purpose 
to influence specific legislation (or similar legislation), a 
taxpayer determines the existence or procedural status of that 
legislation; determines the time, place, and subject of any 
hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to that 
legislation; or prepares routine, brief summaries of the 
provisions of that legislation, the taxpayer is treated as 
engaging in that activity without a purpose of making or 
supporting a lobbying communication. 
The proposed regulations provide a special rule for so- 
called ``paid volunteers.'' If, for the purpose of making or 
supporting a lobbying communication, one taxpayer uses the 
services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not 
compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services 
or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are 
imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade 
association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost 
to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to 
support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade 
association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member. 
As a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation 
with respect to the employee's work in support of the trade 
association's lobbying communication. The proposed regulations 
also provide a general anti-avoidance rule. 
The regulations are proposed to be effective for amounts paid or 
incurred on or after May 13, 1994. Taxpayers will be required to adopt a reasonable 
interpretation of section 162(e)(1)(A) for amounts paid or 
incurred prior to this date. 


Modification of 1993 Proposed Regulations 


On December 27, 1993, the IRS issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (IA-57-93) concerning the allocation of costs to 
lobbying activities. Section 1.162-28(g)(3) of those proposed 
regulations provides a general rule for determining whether a 
meeting with certain specified government officials or employees 
constitutes a lobbying activity (a term that includes influencing 
legislation). Because the proposed regulations contained in this 
document provide rules for determining whether a taxpayer is 
engaged in influencing legislation, the IRS will amend  1.162- 
28(g)(3), when it is promulgated as a final regulation, to 
conform that provision to these proposed regulations. As a 
result, whether sponsoring or attending a meeting constitutes 
influencing legislation will be determined under the rules 
which are the subject of these proposed regulations. Thus, for example, if a 
taxpayer attends a speech by a legislator at which specific 
legislation is discussed, the taxpayer will not necessarily be 
considered to be influencing legislation unless the taxpayer 
makes a communication with the legislator which refers to 
specific legislation and reflects a view on that legislation. 
However, if the taxpayer makes a lobbying communication with 
respect to that legislation (or similar legislation) within the 
same or the succeeding taxable year, the presumptions provided in 
these proposed regulations will apply. 


Grass Roots Lobbying 


The proposed regulations do not address grass roots 
lobbying. Although the proposed regulations provide a definition 
of influencing legislation that is similar to the definition of 
direct lobbying communication under the section 4911 regulations, 
it should not be inferred that the IRS will adopt the definition 
of grassroots lobbying communication under the section 4911 
regulations for purposes of section 162(e)(1)(C). As noted 
above, the prior law rules disallowing business deductions for 
expenses for grassroots lobbying and participation in political 
campaigns remain in effect under OBRA 1993.

It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the 
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, a copy of this notice of proposed 
rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
small business. 


Comments and Public Hearing 


Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
inspection and copying. 
A public hearing has been scheduled for Monday, September 12, 
1994, at 10 a.m. in the Auditorium, Internal Revenue Building, 
1111 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC. Because of access 
restrictions, visitors will not be admitted beyond the building 
lobby more than 15 minutes before the hearing starts. 
The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. 
Persons that wish to present oral comments at the hearing 
must submit written comments by July 12, 1994, and submit 
an outline of the topics to be discussed and the time to be 
devoted to each topic (a signed original and eight (8) copies) by 
Monday, August 22, 1994. 
A period of 10 minutes will be allotted to each person for 
making comments. 
An agenda showing the scheduling of the speakers will be 
prepared after the deadline for receiving outlines has passed. 
Copies of the agenda will be available free of charge at the 
hearing.

162(e)(1)(A). Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general 
rule and necessary definitions for determining whether a taxpayer 
is influencing legislation. Paragraph (c) of this section 
provides rules for determining whether a purpose of an activity 
is to make or support a lobbying communication which constitutes 
influencing legislation. Paragraph (d) of this section provides 
a special rule relating to the use by one taxpayer of the 
services or facilities of another taxpayer in connection with a 
lobbying communication. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a 
general anti-avoidance rule. Paragraph (f) of this section 
provides the effective date. See section 162(e)(2) and  1.162-20(c) for exceptions relating to certain
local legislation. 
These rules are not intended to be applied for purposes of 
section 4911 and the regulations thereunder. See section 4911

formulation of the legislation which the taxpayer desires to 
influence. 
(ii) 

Communication. 

For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, the term 

communication 

is limited to any 
communication (referred to as a 

lobbying communication

) that_

(A) Refers to specific legislation and reflects a view on 
that legislation; or 
(B) Clarifies, amplifies, modifies, or provides support for 
views reflected in a prior communication satisfying the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. 
(iii) 

Attempt to influence legislation. 

An 

attempt to 
influence legislation 

means the lobbying communication and all 
activities, such as research, preparation, and other background 
activities, engaged in for a purpose of making or supporting the 
lobbying communication. See paragraph (c) of this section for 
rules for determining the purpose or purposes for engaging in an 
activity. 
(iv) 

Legislation

. 

Legislation 

includes action with respect 
to Acts, bills, resolutions, or other similar items by the 
Congress, any state legislature, any local council, or similar 
governing body. 

Legislation 

includes a proposed treaty required 
to be submitted by the President to the Senate for its advice and 
consent from the time the President's representative begins to 
negotiate its position with the prospective parties to the 
proposed treaty. 
(v) 

Specific legislation

. 

Specific legislation 

includes 
both legislation that has already been introduced in a 
legislative body and a specific legislative proposal that the 
taxpayer either supports or opposes. 
(vi) 

Action

. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section, the term 

action

 is limited to the introduction, 
amendment, enactment, defeat, or repeal of Acts, bills,

Legislative and administrative bodies

. 

Legislative 
body 

does not include executive, judicial, or administrative

Administrative bodies 

include school boards, housing 
authorities, sewer and water districts, zoning boards, and other 
similar Federal, State, or local special purpose bodies, whether 
elective or appointive. 
(2) 

Examples

. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

 



Example 1

. Taxpayer P's employee, A, is assigned to 
approach members of Congress to gain their support for a pending 
bill. A drafts and P prints a position letter on the bill. P 
distributes the letter to members of Congress. Additionally, A 
personally contacts several members of Congress or their staffs 
to seek support for P's position on the bill. The letter and the 
personal contacts are lobbying communications. Therefore, P is 
influencing legislation. 


Example 2

. Taxpayer R is invited to provide testimony at a 
congressional oversight hearing concerning the implementation of 
The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act 
of 1989. Specifically, the hearing concerns a proposed 
regulation increasing the threshold value of commercial and 
residential real estate transactions for which an appraisal by a 
state licensed or certified appraiser is required. In its 
testimony, R states that it is in favor of the proposed 
regulation. Because R does not refer to any specific legislation 
or reflect a view on any such legislation, R has not made a 
lobbying communication. Therefore, R is not influencing 
legislation. 


Example 3

. State X enacts a statute that requires the 
licensing of all day-care providers. Agency B in State X is 
charged with writing rules to implement the statute. After the 
enactment of the statute, Taxpayer S sends a letter to Agency B 
providing detailed proposed rules that S recommends Agency B 
adopt to implement the statute on licensing of day-care 
providers. Because the letter to Agency B neither refers to nor 
reflects a view on any specific legislation, it is not a lobbying 
communication. Therefore, S is not influencing legislation. 


Example 4

. Taxpayer T proposes to a State Park Authority 
that it purchase a particular tract of land for a new park. Even 
if T's proposal would necessarily require the State Park 
Authority eventually to seek appropriations to acquire the land 
and develop the new park, T has not made a lobbying communication 
because there has been no reference to, nor any view reflected 
on, any specific legislation. Therefore, T's proposal is not 
influencing legislation. 


Example 5

. (i) Taxpayer U prepares a paper that asserts 
that lack of new capital is hurting State X's economy. The paper 
indicates that State X residents either should invest more in 
local businesses or increase their savings so that funds will be 
available to others interested in making investments. U forwards 
a summary of the unpublished paper to legislators in State X with 
a cover letter that states in part:

 


You must take action to improve the 
availability of new capital in the state. 
(ii) Because neither the summary nor the cover letter 
refers to any specific legislative proposal, forwarding the 
summary to legislators in State X is not a lobbying 
communication. Therefore, U is not influencing legislation. 
(iii) Q, a member of the legislature of State X, calls 
taxpayer U to request a copy of the unpublished paper from which 
the summary was prepared. U forwards the paper with a cover 
letter that simply refers to the enclosed materials. Because U's 
letter to Q and the unpublished paper do not refer to any 
specific legislation or reflect a view on any such legislation, 
the letter is not a lobbying communication. Therefore, U is not 
influencing legislation.

 



Example 6

. (i) Taxpayer V prepares a paper that asserts 
that lack of new capital is hurting the national economy. The 
paper indicates that lowering the capital gains rate would 
increase the availability of capital and increase tax receipts 
from the capital gains tax. V forwards the paper to its 
representatives in Congress with a cover letter that says, in 
part:

 

I urge you to support a reduction in 
the capital gains tax rate. 

(ii) V's communication is a lobbying communication because 
it refers to and reflects a view on a specific legislative 
proposal that V supports (i.e., lowering the capital gains rate). 
Therefore, V is influencing legislation.

 



Example 7

. Taxpayer W, based in State A, notes in a letter 
to a legislator of State A that State X has passed a bill that 
accomplishes a stated purpose and then says that State A should 
pass such a bill. No such bill has been introduced into the 
State A legislature. The communication is a lobbying 
communication because it refers to and reflects a view on a 
specific legislative proposal that W supports. Therefore, W is 
influencing legislation. 


Example 8

. (i) Taxpayer Y represents citrus fruit growers. 
Y writes a letter to a Senator discussing how pesticide O has 
benefited citrus fruit growers and disputing problems linked to 
its use. The letter discusses a bill pending in Congress and 
states in part:

 


This bill would prohibit the use of pesticide O. 
If citrus growers are unable to use this pesticide, 
their crop yields will be severely reduced, leading to 
higher prices for consumers and lower profits, even 
bankruptcy, for growers. 
(ii) The communication is a lobbying communication because 
it refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation. 
Therefore, Y is influencing legislation.

 



Example 9

. (i) B, the president of Taxpayer Z, an 
insurance company, meets with Q, who chairs the X state 
legislature's committee with jurisdiction over laws regulating 
insurance companies, to discuss the possibility of legislation to 
address current problems with surplus-line companies. B 
recommends that legislation be introduced that would create 
minimum capital and surplus requirements for surplus-line 
companies and create clearer guidelines concerning the risks that 
surplus-line companies can insure. B's discussion with Q is a 
lobbying communication because B refers to and reflects a view on 
a specific legislative proposal that Z supports. Therefore, Z is 
influencing legislation.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) Q is not convinced that the market for surplus-line 
companies is substantial enough to warrant such legislation and 
requests that B provide information on the amount and types of 
risks covered by surplus-line companies. After the meeting, B 
has employees of Z prepare estimates of the percentage of 
property and casualty insurance risks handled by surplus-line 
companies. B sends the estimates with a cover letter that simply 
refers to the enclosed materials. Although B's follow-up letter 
to Q does not refer to specific legislation or reflect a view on 
such legislation, B's letter supports the views reflected in the 
earlier communication. Therefore, the letter is a lobbying 
communication and Z is influencing legislation.

 

(c) 

Purpose for engaging in an activity_

(1) 

In general.

 
The purpose or purposes for which a taxpayer engages in an 
activity are determined based on all the facts and circumstances. 
(2) 

Multiple purposes. 

If a taxpayer engages in an activity 
both for the purpose of making or supporting a lobbying 
communication and for some non-lobbying purpose, the taxpayer 
must treat the activity as engaged in partially for a lobbying 
purpose and partially for a non-lobbying purpose. This division 
of the activity must result in a reasonable allocation of costs 
to influencing legislation. See  1.162-28 (allocation rules for 
certain expenditures to which section 162(e)(1) applies). A 
taxpayer's treatment will, in general, not result in a reasonable 
allocation if it allocates to influencing legislation_
(i) Only the incremental amount of costs that would not have 
been incurred but for the lobbying purpose; or 
(ii) An amount based on the number of purposes for engaging 
in that activity without regard to the relative importance of 
those purposes. 
(3) 

Presumption of non-lobbying purpose. 

If an activity 
relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in for a non-lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding
the 
taxable year in which the communication is made, the activity is 
presumed to be engaged in for all periods solely for that non-lobbying purpose. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption
in 
part by establishing that the activity was also engaged in for a 
lobbying purpose. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating 
to an activity engaged in for multiple purposes. 
(4) 

Presumption of lobbying purpose. 

If an activity 
relating to a lobbying communication is engaged in during the 
same taxable year as the communication is made or the immediately 
preceding taxable year, and is not within the presumption in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the activity is presumed to be 
engaged in for the sole purpose of making or supporting the 
lobbying communication. A taxpayer can rebut the presumption (in 
whole or part) by establishing that the activity was engaged in 
(entirely or partially) for a non-lobbying purpose. See 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section relating to an activity engaged 
in for multiple purposes. If, during the same taxable year, the 
taxpayer commences an activity that relates directly to the 
subject matter of specific legislation (then in existence) and 
makes a lobbying communication with respect to that legislation, 
it is expected that the taxpayer generally will be unable to 
rebut the presumption. 
(5) 

Activities treated as having no purpose to influence 
legislation. 

A taxpayer that engages in any of the following 
activities is treated as having done so without a purpose of 
making or supporting a lobbying communication_
(i) Prior to evidencing a purpose to influence any specific 
legislation referred to in this paragraph (c)(5)(i) (A) or (B) (or 
similar legislation)_
(A) Determining the existence or procedural status of 
specific legislation, or the time, place, and subject of any 
hearing to be held by a legislative body with respect to specific 
legislation; or 
(B) Preparing routine, brief summaries of the provisions of 
specific legislation. 
(ii) Performing an activity for purposes of complying with 
the requirements of any law. 
(iii) Reading any general circulation publications or 
viewing or listening to other mass media communications available 
to the general public. 
(6) 

Examples. 

The provisions of this paragraph (c) are 
illustrated by the following examples: 






Example 1. 

In 1995, Agency F issues proposed regulations 
relating to the business of Taxpayer W, a calendar year taxpayer. 
There is no specific legislation during 1995 that is similar to 
the regulatory proposal. W undertakes a study of the impact of 
the proposed regulations on its business. W incorporates the 
results of that study in comments sent to Agency F in 1995. In 
1996, legislation is introduced in Congress that is similar to 
the regulatory proposal. W writes a letter to Senator P stating 
that it opposes the proposed legislation. With the letter, W 
encloses a copy of the comments it sent to Agency F. W's letter 
to Senator P refers to and reflects a view on specific 
legislation and therefore is a lobbying communication. Because W 
used the results of its study of the impact of the proposed 
regulations in its letter to Senator P in the taxable year 
following the taxable year the study was conducted, it is 
presumed under paragraph (c)(4) of this section that W engaged in 
the study for the sole purpose of making or supporting that 
lobbying communication. Based on these facts, however, W can 
rebut the presumption entirely by showing that its sole purpose 
for undertaking the study was to comment on the proposed 
regulations. 


Example 2. 

In the ordinary course of its business, Taxpayer 
Y, a calendar year manufacturing company, regularly keeps records 
of electricity consumption in its manufacturing process. Y has 
kept such records since 1970, the year in which Y began business, 
in order to track the cost of its manufacturing process. In 
1995, the governor of State Q proposes a budget that includes a 
sales tax on electricity. Using its records of electricity 
consumption, Y estimates the additional costs that the budget 
proposal would impose upon its business. In the same year, Y 
writes to members of the state legislature and explains that it 
opposes the increased sales tax. In its letter, Y includes its 
estimate of the costs that the sales tax would impose on its 
business. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it 
refers to and reflects a view on specific legislation, the 
governor's proposed budget). Both the recordkeeping activities 
and the activity of estimating additional costs under the 
proposed sales tax relate to the lobbying communication because Y 
used the records to make the estimates, and Y used the estimates 
in its opposition to the governor's proposal. However, Y had a 
non-lobbying purpose for keeping the records and engaged in that 
activity prior to the first taxable year preceding the taxable 
year in which it made the lobbying communication. Therefore, 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed that Y 
kept these records solely for a non-lobbying purpose during all 
periods. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot rebut the 
presumption. In contrast, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) 
of this section, that Y estimated the additional costs it would 
incur under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying 
communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable 
year as the lobbying communication was made. Based on these 
facts, because Y estimated its additional costs under the budget 
proposal to support the lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut 
the presumption as it relates to this activity.

Example 3. 

In 1995, a Senator in the State Q legislature 
announces her intention to introduce legislation to require 
health insurers to cover a particular medical procedure in all 
policies sold in the state. Taxpayer Y, a calendar year 
taxpayer, has different policies for two groups of employees, one 
of which covers the procedure and one of which does not. After 
the bill is introduced, Y's legislative affairs staff asks Y's 
human resources staff to track claims for the procedure that are 
allowed, in order to estimate the additional cost of requiring 
the coverage under both policies. In 1996, Y's legislative 
affairs staff prepares a study estimating Y's increased costs 
based on the results of tracking, in 1995, the claims made. Also 
in 1996, Y writes to members of the state legislature and 
explains that it opposes the proposed change in insurance 
coverage based on the study. The letter is a lobbying 
communication (because it refers to and reflects a view on 
specific legislation). Both the activity of tracking the claims 
and the activity of estimating Y's additional costs under the 
proposed legislation relate to the lobbying communication because 
they are used to support that communication. It is presumed, 
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, that Y engaged in 1996 in 
the activity of estimating the additional costs it would incur 
under the proposal solely to make or support the lobbying 
communication, because the activity commenced in the same taxable 
year as the lobbying communication. Based on these facts, Y 
cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to this activity. 
Further, because Y did not regularly track these claims before 
1995, it is presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, 
that Y engaged in 1995 in the activity of tracking these claims 
solely to make or support the lobbying communication. Based on 
these facts, because Y tracked these claims to support the 
lobbying communication, Y cannot rebut the presumption. 


Example 4. 

After several years of developmental work under 
various contracts, in 1997, Taxpayer A, a calendar year aerospace 
company, contracts with the Department of Defense (DOD) to 
produce a prototype of a new generation military aircraft. A is 
aware that DOD will be able to fund the contract only if Congress 
appropriates an amount for that purpose in the upcoming 
appropriations process. In 1998, A conducts simulation tests of 
the aircraft and revises the specifications of the aircraft's 
expected performance capabilities, as required under the 
contract. A submits the results of the tests and the revised 
specifications to DOD. In 1999, Congress considers legislation 
to appropriate funds for the contract. In that connection, A 
summarizes the results of the simulation tests and of the 
aircraft's expected performance capabilities, and submits the 
summary to interested members of Congress with a cover letter 
that encourages them to support appropriations of funds for the 
contract. The letter is a lobbying communication (because it 
refers to specific legislation (i.e., appropriations) and 
requests passage). The described activities in 1998 and 1999 
relate to that lobbying communication and, therefore, are 
presumed, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, to be for the 
sole purpose of making or supporting that communication. Based 
on these facts, A cannot rebut the presumption as it relates to 
the summary prepared specifically for that communication. 
However, because A conducted the tests and revised the 
specifications to comply with its production contract with DOD, A 
can rebut the presumption as it relates to those activities. 


Example 5. 

C, president of Taxpayer W, travels to the state 
capital to attend a two-day conference on new manufacturing 
processes. C plans to spend a third day in the capital meeting 
with state legislators to explain why W opposes a pending bill 
unrelated to the subject of the conference. C's staff prepares a 
briefing book on the pending bill for C's use in meetings with 
the state legislators. Because the meetings with the legislators 
will be lobbying communications (because C will refer to and 
reflect a view on specific legislation), C's travel and the 
preparation of the briefing book are presumed to be solely for 
the purpose of making or supporting the lobbying communications. 
Based on these facts, W cannot rebut the presumption as it 
relates to the preparation of the briefing book, but can 
partially rebut the presumption as it relates to C's travel by 
demonstrating that the travel was engaged in both for lobbying 
and non-lobbying purposes. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, W must reasonably allocate C's travel between 
attending the conference and meeting with the state legislators. 


Example 6. 

In 1995, Taxpayer F comments on proposed EPA 
regulations and successfully contests their validity on 
constitutional grounds in litigation. In 1997, Senator N 
introduces environmental legislation, which F believes to be 
unconstitutional on the same grounds as the previously proposed 
and defeated regulations. F sends some of the documents it 
prepared in 1995 to Senator N's staff with a cover letter 
indicating that F opposes the environmental legislation. The 
letter to Senator N refers to and reflects a view on specific 
legislation and thus is a lobbying communication. F engaged in 
the activity of preparing the documents, however, for a non- 
lobbying purpose prior to the first taxable year preceding the 
taxable year in which the lobbying communication was made. 
Therefore, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is presumed 
that the document preparation was engaged in solely for a non- 
lobbying purpose. Based on these facts, the Commissioner cannot 
rebut that presumption. 


Example 7. 

On February 1, 1995, a bill is introduced in 
Congress that would affect Company E, a calendar year taxpayer. 
Employees in E's legislative affairs department, as is customary, 
prepare a brief summary of the bill and periodically confirm the 
procedural status of the bill through conversations with 
employees and members of Congress. On March 31, 1995, the head 
of E's legislative affairs department meets with E's President to 
request that B, a chemist, temporarily help the legislative 
affairs department analyze the bill. The President agrees, and 
suggests that B also be assigned to draft a position letter in 
opposition to the bill. Employees of the legislative affairs 
department continue to confirm periodically the procedural status 
of the bill. On October 31, 1995, B's position letter in 
opposition to the bill is delivered to members of Congress. B's 
letter is a lobbying communication because it refers to and 
reflects a view on specific legislation. Under paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section, the assignment of B to assist the 
legislative affairs department in analyzing the bill and in 
drafting a position letter in opposition to the bill evidences a 
purpose to influence legislation. Based on these facts, neither 
the activity of periodically confirming the procedural status of 
the bill nor the activity of preparing the routine, brief summary 
of the bill before March 31 constitutes influencing legislation. 
With respect to periodically confirming the procedural status of 
the bill on or after March 31, it is presumed, under paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section, that E engaged in the activity solely to 
make or support the lobbying communication because the activity 
commenced in the same taxable year as the lobbying communication. 
These facts indicate that after March 31, E determined the 
procedural status of the bill for the purpose of supporting the 
lobbying communication by B and, accordingly, E cannot rebut the 
presumption as it relates to this activity.

Example 8. 

Taxpayer Z prepares a report that it is required 
by state law to submit to a state corporation commission. Z 
sends a copy of the report to its delegate in the state 
legislature along with the taxpayer's letter opposing a bill that 
would increase the state sales tax. Even though the letter to 
the delegate is a lobbying communication (because it refers to, 
and reflects a view on, specific legislation), under paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) of this section, the preparation of the report does 
not constitute influencing legislation. 


Example 9. 

Taxpayer Y purchases an annual subscription to a 
commercial, general circulation newsletter that provides 
legislative updates on proposed tax legislation. Employees in 
Y's legislative affairs department read the newsletter in order 
to keep abreast of legislative developments. Even if Y attempts 
to influence legislation that is identified and tracked in the 
newsletter, under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, the time 
spent by employees of Y reading the newsletter does not 
constitute influencing legislation.

 

(d) 

Special imputation rule. 

If one taxpayer, for the 
purpose of making or supporting a lobbying communication, uses 
the services or facilities of a second taxpayer and does not 
compensate the second taxpayer for the full cost of the services 
or facilities, the purpose and actions of the first taxpayer are 
imputed to the second taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a trade 
association uses the services of a member's employee, at no cost 
to the association, to conduct research or similar activities to 
support the trade association's lobbying communication, the trade 
association's purpose and actions are imputed to the member. As 
a result, the member is treated as influencing legislation with 
respect to the employee's work in support of the trade 
association's lobbying communication. 
(e) 

Anti-avoidance rule. 

If a taxpayer, alone or in 
coordination with one or more other taxpayers, purposely 
structures its attempts to influence legislation to achieve 
results that are unreasonable in light of the purposes of section 
162(e) and section 6033(e), the Commissioner can take such steps 
as are appropriate to achieve reasonable results consistent with 
the purposes of section 162(e), section 6033(e), and this 
section. 
(f) 

Effective date. 

This section is effective for amounts 
paid or incurred on or after May 13, 1994. Taxpayers must adopt a 
reasonable interpretation of section 162(e)(1)(A) for amounts 
paid or incurred prior to this date. 
Par. 3. In  1.162-20, paragraph (c)(5) is added to read as 
follows: 


 1.162-20 

Expenditures attributable to lobbying, political 
campaigns, attempts to influence legislation, etc., and certain 
advertising. 


 * * * * *


(c) * * * 
(5) 

Expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, in 
connection with influencing legislation other than certain local 
legislation. 

The provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) 
of this section are superseded for expenses paid or incurred 
after December 31, 1993, in connection with influencing 
legislation (other than certain local legislation) to the extent 
inconsistent with section 162(e)(1)(A) (as limited by section 
162(e)(2)) and   1.162-20T(d) and 1.162-29.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing on proposed amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the receipt of a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter,
the ``Colorado program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment
consists of revisions to the Colorado rules pertaining to bonding of surface coal mining and reclamation operations
and revegetation success criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential use.


The amendment is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations,
clarify ambiguities, and improve operational efficiency.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Colorado Program


On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program. General background
information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Colorado program can be found in the December 15, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Colorado's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 906.15,
906.16, and 906.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated April 18, 1994, Colorado submitted the proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. CO-611). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in response to the May 7, 1986, and March 22, 1990,
letters (administrative record Nos. CO-282 and CO-496) that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30
CFR 732.17(c), and at its own initiative. The provisions of 2 Code of Colorado Regulations 407-2, the rules and
regulations of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board, that Colorado proposes to amend are: Rule 1.04, definitions;
Rule 3.02, performance bond requirements for surface coal mining and reclamation operations; Rule 3.03, release
of performance bonds; Rule 3.06, special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities;
and Rule 4.15.10, revegetation success criteria for areas to be developed for industrial, commercial, or residential
use.
Specifically, Colorado proposes the following changes to the previsions of its rules at:

III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Colorado program.


1. Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commentor's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.



2. Public Hearing 


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., m.d.t. May, 31, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.


3. Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES

. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming Mountain Climbing and Winter Backcountry Trip Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Park Service (NPS) proposes to eliminate registration and check out requirements for climbing and off
trail travel above 7,000 ft., and for winter travel in Grand Teton National Park. Existing regulations requiring
climbers, off trail hikers, and winter travel users to register and check out upon completion of their activity were
intended primarily to provide information necessary to initiate search and rescue responses. Actual experience
over the years has shown that the intended purpose of these regulations has not been achieved. Nearly all search and
rescue responses are generated by reports from sources other than the check out system. Instead of aiding rescuers,
these regulations burden park rangers with the task of checking on countless cases of climbers and backpackers who
failed to check out. These regulations have been enforced selectively for several years, where local climbers and
guides have not been forced to register because of an assumed expertise and knowledge of the local area. The deletion
of these regulations will not eliminate visitor protection services provided by park personnel.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background


The existing National Park Service (NPS) special regulations that pertain to mountain climbing, off trail travel,
and winter travel trips are codified at 36 CFR 7.22 (f) and (g). They require all technical climbers, off trail travel,
and winter travel users to register or check in prior to undertaking these activities and to check out with a ranger
upon completion of the activity. The original intent was primarily to provide park search and rescue personnel with
the knowledge that a park user was in essence overdue from a potentially dangerous activity. In reality, almost all
perceived overdue parties concerned climbers and backcountry users failing to properly check out. In addition,
the vast majority of winter travelers either ignore or do not know of the requirement to register, and strict enforcement
of this regulation has not been done for several years. The result has been a combination of non-compliance, failure
to check out, failure to contact a ranger in a timely manner and wasted time and energy on the part of the park staff administering
the system. After working with these restrictions since promulgation it has been determined that they are not achieving
their original purpose of saving lives by alerting search and rescue personnel. In reality, almost all park search
and rescue efforts are the result of initial reports by climbing partners, other park backcountry users, friends
or relatives.
The NPS believes the deletion of these rules will make the management of mountain climbing and winter backcountry
trips more consistent with the practices of both state and federal agencies whose lands are contiguous with Grand
Teton National Park. Overnight backcountry trips will continue to be regulated by general camping regulations at
36 CFR 2.10.
A voluntary registration system will be available to climbers and backcountry travelers who choose to use it. The
exchange of information between climbers, off trail hikers, winter travelers and park rangers will still be available
and encouraged without mandating it through regulation. Furthermore the park staff will be educating park users
to leave trip information with family or friends, shifting responsibility for trip planning onto the park user.

Public Participation



The policy of the National Park Service is, whenever practicable, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding this proposed
rule to the address noted at the beginning of this rulemaking. The Grand Teton National Park staff will also be making
public notices in local papers and contacting representatives of the local climbing community.



Drafting Information



The primary authors of this proposed rule are Colin W. Campbell, Law Enforcement Specialist, and Mark L. Magnuson,
Jenny Lake Sub-District Ranger.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.





Compliance With Other Laws



The Department of the Interior has determined that this document will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), because it deletes an existing requirement and gives more discretion to the park visitor.

The NPS has determined that this proposed rulemaking will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human
environment, health and safety because it is not expected to:

(a) Increase public use to the extent of compromising the nature and character of the area causing physical damage
to it; 

(b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature and characteristics of the area, or cause physical
damage to it;

(c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses; or

(d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants.

Based on this determination, this proposed rulemaking is categorically excluded from the procedural requirements
of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by Departmental Regulations in 516 DM 6, (49 FR 21438). As such, neither
an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared. 

This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plan Revision for Colorado; Long-Term Strategy
Review of Mandatory Class I Federal Area Visibility Protection



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Long- Term Strategy of Colorado's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for
Visibility Protection, as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. The revisions were made
to bring the SIP into compliance with the Federal visibility protection requirements for states containing mandatory
Class I Federal Areas, and to fulfill requirements to periodically review and, if necessary, revise the Long-Term
Strategy for visibility protection. EPA is also proposing to correct its error in a previous action on the State's
Visibility protection provisions. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Section 169A of the Clean Air Act

1

 establishes as a national goal the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility
in mandatory class I Federal areas

2

 which impairment results from manmade air pollution. Section 169A called for EPA to, among other things, issue regulations
to assure reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal, section 169A(a)(4), including requiring each State
with a mandatory Class I Federal area to revise its State implementation plan (SIP) to contain such emission limits,
schedules of compliance and other measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the National
goal. Section 169A(b)(2).






EPA promulgated regulations that, in broad outline, required affected States to: (1) Coordinate development of
SIPs with appropriate Federal land managers; (2) develop a program to assess and remedy visibility impairment from
new and existing sources; and (3) develop a long-term strategy to assure reasonable progress toward the National
visibility goal. 45 FR 80084 (December 2, 1980) (codified at 40 CFR 51.300-51.307). The regulations provided
for the remedying of visibility impairment that is reasonably attributable to a single existing stationary facility
or small group of existing stationary facilities. These regualtions required that the SIPs provide for periodic
review and revisions, as appropriate, of the long-term strategy not less frequent than every three years, that the
review process include consultation with the appropriate FLMs and that the State report to the public and EPA a specified
assessment of its progress toward the National goal. See 40 CFR 51.306(c).
On July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544) and November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45132), EPA disapproved SIPs of states that failed to comply
with the requirements of, among others, the provisions of 40 CFR 51.302 (visibility general plan requirements),
51.305 (visibility monitoring), and 51.306 (visibility Long-Term Strategy). EPA also incorporated corresponding
Federal plans and regulations into the SIPs of these states pursuant to section 110(c)(1) of the Act. The Governor
of Colorado submitted a SIP revision for visibility protection on December 21, 1987, which met the criteria of 40 CFR
51.302, 51.305, and 51.306 and consisted of five major sections: existing impairment, new source review, consultation
with Federal land managers, monitoring strategy, and the long-term strategy. EPA approved this SIP revision in an
August 12, 1988 

Federal Register

 document (53 FR 30428), and these revisions replaced the Federal plans and regulations in the Colorado Visibility
SIP.


II. Revisions Submitted November 18, 1992


At its public hearing on August 20, 1992, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (AQCC) adopted revisions to
the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility SIP and revisions concerning the Long-Term Strategy in Commission
Regulation No. 3. These revisions require the Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) to review the Long-Term Strategy
and report on visibility progress at regular intervals. In a letter dated November 18, 1992, the Governor of Colorado
submitted these revisions to EPA. These revisions were made to bring the plan into compliance with Federal regulation
and to fulfill the Federal and Colorado requirements to review and, if necessary, revise the Long-Term Strategy at
least every three years. This submittal updates the State's Visibility Long-Term Strategy and makes it consistent
with Federal requirements. Pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act, EPA found the submittal to be complete and so
notified the Governor in a letter dated January 15, 1993.
Regulation No. 3 previously required a Long-Term Strategy review/revision report from the APCD to the AQCC every
three years following the effective date of the regulation (November 1987). The August 1992 Long-Term Strategy report
was the first to be completed by APCD and, therefore, was behind schedule in arriving at the AQCC (i.e., it should have
been prepared by 1990). The purpose of the regulatory change was to clarify, in light of the delay in submitting the
initial report, when subsequent Long-Term Strategy review and revision report cycles would occur. Without this
regulatory change, the next Long-Term Strategy review would have been due September 1993_approximately a year from
the adoption of the August 1992 report. To adjust the reporting schedule, the regulation was revised. The revision
indicates that the Long-Term Strategy report will be made available by September 1 at least every third year following
the submittal of the previous report. If the proposed approval of this revision is finalized by EPA, the submittal
of the next report by September 1, 1995 will be a federally-enforceable obligation.
Regulation No. 3 was also revised to clear up a discrepancy with EPA requirements regarding the scope of review of the
Long-Term Strategy. Among the items indicated for review in the previous version of the regulation was the ``progress
achieved in developing the components of the Long-Term Strategy.'' The State revised the language to indicate that
the Long-Term Strategy must be reviewed, among other things, to determine ``[t]he need for BART [Best Available Retrofit
Technology] to remedy existing impairment in an integral vista declared since plan approval.'' This change brings
the State's program into conformance with EPA regulations. See 40 CFR 51.306(c)(7). Declaration of an integral vista
allows for protection of visibility resources outside a mandatory Class I area affecting views from within the area.
See 40 CFR 51.301(n). The State has not identified any integral vistas at this time, but may do so in the future at its
discretion.
Finally, this SIP revision consists of replacing the original Long-Term Strategy with the revised Long-Term Strategy
adopted by the State in August, 1992. The SIP revisions address when the Long-Term Strategy review is to be completed,
factors to be assessed in periodic Long-Term Strategy reviews, and components of the Long-Term Strategy plan (e.g.,
existing impairment, prevention of future impairment, smoke management practices, Federal land manager consultation
and communication, and annual visibility data reports).
In a February 18, 1993 letter from Doug Skie, EPA, to Paul Frohardt, APCD, EPA requested additional information to
determine the approvability of the SIP revisions. From a technical standpoint, EPA found the Long-Term Strategy
review and report complete and fully approvable. However, the revision to the timing of the reporting schedule raised
some concerns. According to Federal regulation (40 CFR 51.306), ``[t]he plan must provide for periodic review and
revision, as appropriate, of the long- term strategy not less frequent than every three years.'' Colorado's reviews
should have occurred in 1990, 1993, 1996, and so forth. The August 20, 1992 review and report were nearly two years late.
Rather than conducting another review in 1993, the revision changed the schedule to provide for review at least every
third year following the submittal of the previous report. Therefore, since the first report was prepared in 1992,
the reviews would occur in 1992, 1995, 1998, and so forth. In effect, only two reviews/reports would be submitted to
EPA through 1996, when three reports should have been provided.
Therefore, the State committed in a March 5, 1993 letter to Doug Skie, EPA, to prepare and submit a brief informal status
report on the Long-Term Strategy by November, 1993. In this way, the State will have provided three reports through
the 1996 timeframe (1992, 1993, 1995). The State fulfilled its commitment by submitting to EPA an informal Long-Term
Strategy status report dated December 1, 1993.
The State believes that the Long-Term Strategy revisions to the Visibility SIP will provide for continued Class I
visibility protection in Colorado, as well as bring the SIP into conformance with Federal requirements for Long-
Term Strategy review. This action was requested by the State of Colorado. 
EPA is also proposing, under section 110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act, to correct the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a) (``Visibility
protection''). This provision incorrectly states:



The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met, because the plan does not include approvable procedures
for protection of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas.




When EPA initially approved the general elements of Colorado's visibility protection program on August 12, 1988
(53 FR 30428), the State's visibility new source review (NSR) regulations had not yet been approved. Therefore, the
program disapproval of 40 CFR 52.344(a), quoted above, which had been adopted on July 12, 1985 (50 FR 28544), was retained.
Colorado's visibility NSR regulations were approved on December 1, 1988 as to industrial source categories for which
EPA had approved Colorado's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and nonattainment NSR permit requirements
(53 FR 48537). For other sources, for which Colorado did not have approved PSD and nonattainment NSR regulations,
EPA disapproved the State's visibility NSR regulations and continued to implement Federal regulations in 40 CFR
52.26 and 52.28, as incorporated into the Colorado SIP. This exception to approval is noted in 40 CFR 52.344(b).
At the time of approval of the visibility NSR regulations, the provision of 40 CFR 52.344(a), relating to over-all
program disapproval, should have been revised to indicate that Colorado's visibility protection program was approved,
with the exception of visibility NSR as it applied to certain industrial source categories. With this notice, EPA
proposes to correct section 52.344(a) to accurately reflect the status of program approval in Colorado.


III. Implications of This Action


EPA has reviewed the adequacy of Colorado's Long-term strategy review and revisions relative to its date of adoption
in 1992. EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's revision to the Long-Term Strategy of the Class I Visibility Protection
SIP, as submitted by the Governor with a letter dated November 18, 1992. EPA is also proposing to approve revisions
to Colorado AQCC Regulation No. 3 to bring it into conformance with Federal requirements for the Long-Term Strategy
and to revise the reporting schedule. EPA proposes to determine that these revisions are consistent with applicable
Federal requirements for Long-Term Strategy review under the Clean Air Act's visibility protection program for
mandatory Class I Federal Areas. 
EPA is also proposing to correct its error in failing to accurately reflect Colorado's Visibility SIP approval status
in a previous action on the State's Visibility protection provisions. 


IV. Request for Public Comments


EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will consider
any comments received by June 13, 1994. 


V. Executive Order (EO) 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:



(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.


VI. Regulatory Flexibility


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public 
hearing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Standards implementing two provisions of the Clean 
Air Act (the Act) are being proposed by today's notice. One 
set of standards is proposed under section 183(f) of the Act 
and would limit air emissions of volatile organic compounds 
(VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and 
existing marine tank vessel loading and unloading 
operations. These standards would require the application 
of reasonably available control technology (RACT). 



An additional set of standards is proposed under 
section 112(d) of the Act and would limit air emissions of 
HAP from new and existing marine tank vessel loading and 
unloading operations. These proposed national emission 
standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) would 
require existing and new major sources to control emissions 
using the maximum achievable control technology (MACT).

I. Background 


A. History 


In 1982, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) began working with the EPA regarding
the establishment of Federal regulations under the Clean Air Act pertaining to air pollutants emitted from commercial
marine vessels. The MARAD raised concerns regarding the potential disruption of interstate and foreign commerce
and safety problems that may result from State regulation of marine vessel emissions. The MARAD believed that the
most appropriate method to control these emissions without causing undue disruption of commerce or safety problems
would be for the EPA to promulgate national standards regulating air pollutants from these sources. 

In 1985, the U.S. Department of Transportation 
requested that the National Academy of Sciences' National 
Research Council (NRC) evaluate the feasibility of 
controlling emissions from marine tank vessel loading 
operations. At that time, many States were already 
considering vapor controls for barge and tankship loading 
and tankship ballasting. The NRC Commission on Engineering 
and Technical Systems (CETS) then convened a Committee on 
Control and Recovery of Hydrocarbon Vapors from Ships and 
Barges. This committee operated under the guidance of the 
Marine Board of the NRC. The committee and the Marine Board 
consisted of members of industry and academia and State 
representatives. The Coast Guard (U.S. Department of 
Transportation) and the EPA also worked with the committee 
on the feasibility study. In 1987, the committee issued its 
report ``Controlling Hydrocarbon Emissions From Tank Vessel 
Loading'' (Docket A-90-44, item II-I-4). 
The Marine Board's report determined that controls were 
technically feasible but that there was a need for the Coast 
Guard to promulgate safety requirements and a need for the 
EPA to set uniform emissions standards to mitigate some of 
the safety issues that could arise from varied State 
regulations. The report recommended that the Coast Guard 
``lead the development and implementation of a coordinated 
program to ensure the safety and standardization of maritime 
hydrocarbon vapor emissions controls.'' The Coast Guard 
would be responsible for the safety issues involved 
(standardized equipment, detonation arrestors, personnel 
training, etc.), and the EPA would be responsible for the 
emissions standards. One of the methods suggested to 
achieve the coordination necessary to develop standards for 
marine tank vessel loading operations was an amendment to 
the Act. 
Part of the Marine Board's task was to develop cost 
estimates. The Marine Board contracted United Technical 
Design (UTD) to develop cost estimates for three different 
model terminals and four model vessels. These model 
terminals and costs served as the basis for the EPA costs 
(Docket A-90-44, item II-I-5). 
In response to the NRC recommendation, the Coast 
Guard's Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) 
formed a Subcommittee on Vapor Control to develop standards 
for designing and operating vapor control systems. This 
CTAC subcommittee presented its final recommendations to the 
Coast Guard in February 1989. The Coast Guard standards for 
safe design, installation, and operation of marine vapor 
recovery equipment were promulgated in June 1990 
(55 FR 2596). The Coast Guard regulations are found in 
33 CFR part 154 and 46 CFR part 39.

As a result of the NRC recommendation, Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) added a new section 
to the Act, section 183(f), that requires the EPA to 
promulgate standards applicable to emissions of VOC and 
other air pollutants resulting from the loading and 
unloading of tank vessels. 
The 1990 amendments also revised section 112 of the Act 
to require the EPA to publish a list of categories of major 
sources and area sources of listed HAP and to promulgate 
emissions standards for each listed category of emission 
sources. In the Agency's initial list of categories of 
sources to be regulated under section 112(c) of the Act, the 
marine vessel loading and unloading source category was not 
listed because the Agency intended to regulate the emissions 
of HAP as well as VOC under the authority of section 183(f) 
of the Act (57 FR 31566, July 16, 1992). After publication 
of this initial list of source categories, the Agency 
decided to regulate HAP emissions from major sources of 
marine vessel loading and unloading facilities under 
authority of section 112 of the Act (58 FR 60021, 
November 12, 1993). 


B. Legal Authority for Tank Vessel Standards 


1. Clean Air Act Section 183(f) 


Section 183(f) of the Act requires the Administrator, 
in consultation with the Secretary of the Department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating, to



Promulgate standards applicable to the emissions 
of VOC and any other air pollutant from loading 
and unloading of tank vessels (as that term is 
defined in section 2101 of title 46 of the United 
States Code) which the Administrator finds causes, 
or contributes to, air pollution that may be 
reasonably anticipated to endanger public health 
or welfare. Such standards shall require the 
application of reasonably available control 
technology, considering costs, any non-air-quality 
benefits, environmental impacts, energy 
requirements and safety factors associated with 
alternative control techniques.

 

The Act further directed the Administrator to limit the 
application of the standards, to the extent practicable, to 
loading and unloading facilities and not to tank vessels. 
The standards were to be promulgated within 2 years after 
enactment of the amended Act and must be effective within 
2 years of promulgation. The Coast Guard was directed to 
issue regulations ``to insure the safety of the equipment and 
operations which are to control emissions from the loading 
and unloading of tank vessels * * *.'' 


2. Clean Air Act Section 112 


Title III of the 1990 amendments revised section 112 of 
the Act to reduce the amount of nationwide air toxics 
emissions. Under title III, section 112 was amended to give 
the EPA the authority to establish national standards to 
reduce air toxics from industries that generate these 
emissions. Section 112(b) contains a list of 189 HAP, the 
emissions of which are to be regulated. Specific HAP on the 
list include benzene (including benzene from gasoline), 
toluene, and hexane. Section 112(c) directs the EPA to use 
this pollutant list to develop and publish a list of all 
categories of major and area sources of the pollutants on 
the HAP list. National emissions standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) will be developed for each of the 
source categories on that list. The list of source 
categories was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 16, 
1992 (57 FR 31576) and was revised to include marine vessel 
loading and unloading operations on November 12, 1993 
(58 FR 60021). 
The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions 
from both new and existing major and area sources according 
to the statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the 
Act. (Section 112(a) defines a major source as any 
stationary source or group of stationary sources located 
within a contiguous area and under common control that emits 
or has the potential to emit considering control, 10 tons 
per year or more of any HAP or 25 tons per year of any 
combination of HAP. An area source is any stationary source 
that is not considered ``major''.) The statute requires the 
standards to reflect the maximum degree of reduction in 
emissions of HAP that is achievable for new or existing 
sources. This control level is referred to as the ``maximum 
achievable control technology (MACT)'', the selection of 
which must reflect consideration of the cost of achieving 
the emission reduction, any nonair quality health and 
environmental impacts, and energy requirements for control 
levels more stringent than the MACT floors. 
The MACT floor is the minimum stringency level for MACT 
standards. For new sources, MACT must be no less stringent 
than the level of emission control already achieved in 
practice by the best controlled similar source. For 
existing sources, MACT must be no less stringent than the 
average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
12 percent of existing sources or the best performing 
5 sources in categories or subcategories with fewer than 
30 sources.

<TEXT>
 

Once the floor has been determined for new or existing 
sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator 
must set MACT standards that ``shall require the maximum 
degree of emission reduction of the hazardous air pollutants 
subject to this section * * * that the Administrator, taking 
into consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental 
impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable 
for new or existing sources * * *.'' These standards must 
be no less stringent than the MACT floor. Such standards 
must then be met by all sources within the category or 
subcategory. In establishing standards, the Administrator 
may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources 
within a category or subcategory. 



C. Process Description and Description of Control Technologies 



1. Process Description 



Marine tank vessel loading operations are facilities 
that load and unload liquid commodities (e.g., crude oil, 
gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, toluene, alcohols, fuel oil 
Numbers 2 and 6, some chemicals, and groups of solvents or 
petrochemical products, etc.) in bulk. The cargo is pumped 
from the terminal's large, above-ground storage tanks 
through a network of pipes and into a storage compartment 
(tank) on the vessel. Most marine tank vessel loading 
operations are associated with petroleum refineries or 
synthetic organic chemical manufacturers, or are independent 
terminals. 

Gasoline, crude oil, and other VOC- and HAP-emitting 
commodities are normally delivered from refinery to terminal 
or terminal to terminal via pipeline, ship, or barge. 
During marine tank vessel loading operations, emissions 
result as the liquid that is being loaded into the vessel 
displaces vapors from the vessel's tank. The vapors emitted 
fall into two categories: Arrival emissions and generated 
emissions. Arrival emissions are attributed to any vapors 
remaining in the otherwise empty cargo tanks prior to 
loading. Generated emissions refer to vapors resulting from 
the evaporation of the liquid cargo as it is loaded. The 
ratio of arrival vapors to generated vapors can vary greatly 
depending upon the liquid, vapor pressure, loading method, 
and loading conditions. 

The major emission points for marine vessel loading 
operations include open tank hatches and overhead vent 
systems. Overhead vent systems collect vapors displaced 
during loading and route them to a vertical pipe or stack. 
The vapors are released well above the height of the deck 
with an upward velocity to help isolate the vapors from the 
deck. Other possible emission points are hatch covers or 
domes, pressure-vacuum relief valves, seals, and vents. 

Emissions may also occur during ballasting, which is 
the process of drawing ballast (i.e., water) into a cargo 
hold. When ballast is loaded into tanks that contain vapors 
from the preceding cargo, the vapor is displaced and emitted 
from the vessel. Most tankships carrying crude oil built 
since 1980 are required by domestic law and international 
agreement to use segregated ballast tanks, which prevent the 
possibility of ballast emissions (see also: The Port and 
Tanker Safety Act (1978), the Act to Prevent Pollution from 
Ships (1980), the Marine Vapor Control System Standards 
(55 FR 25396, June 21, 1990); and the Double Hull Standards 
for Tank Vessels Carrying Oil (57 FR 36221, August 12, 
1992). However, some older and smaller tankships may be 
exempt from these requirements. Inland barges do not carry 
ballast. 



2. Control Technologies 



The description of control technologies has two 
components, the capture of vapors and the destruction or 
recovery of VOC and HAP. The capture of vapors at the 
marine vessel requires that the compartments on both 
tankships and barges be closed to the atmosphere during 
loading. Most tankships are already equipped for closed 
loading as a result of having inert gas systems on board 
because closed loading is necessary to maintain the legally 
required minimum inert gas pressure in the cargo tanks in 
accordance with Coast Guard regulations (46 CFR 32.53 and 
46 CFR 153.500). Barges generally do not use inert gas and 
are usually open loaded. Equipment necessary for closed 
loading includes (1) devices to protect tanks from 
underpressurization and overpressurization, (2) level-monitoring 
and alarm systems to prevent overfilling, and 
(3) devices for cargo gauging and sampling. 

The vapor emissions captured from marine tank vessel 
loading operations can be controlled using one of two 
primary methods: Combustion or recovery. Combustion 
devices include flares, enclosed flares, and thermal and 
catalytic incinerators. The primary recovery methods are 
carbon adsorption, absorption, vapor balancing, and 
refrigeration. (For a more complete discussion of the 
capture and control techniques, consult the technical 
support document (TSD) previously mentioned in the 

ADDRESSES

 
section.) 



II. Summary of the Proposed Standards 



The following summarizes the proposed standards. A 
full discussion of the rationale underlying these proposed 
regulations is found in part III. 



A. Source Category To Be Regulated 



The source category to be regulated is major source 
marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations. 
Regulations will require those operations exceeding certain 
gasoline or crude oil throughput cutoffs or certain HAP 
emissions cutoff at major sources to install vapor control 
systems. Approximately 300 marine tank vessel loading and 
unloading operations would be affected by these proposed 
regulations. Vessels loading at affected sources must meet 
vapor tightness criteria in order to load product. 

The source category includes only emissions that are 
directly caused by the loading and unloading of bulk liquids 
at points where marine terminal equipment is connected to 
marine vessel sources. Thus, this source category does not 
include storage tanks and leaking equipment associated with 
terminal transfer operations. Nor does this source category 
include emissions from offshore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid 
transfer operations (i.e., lightering operations). 
Lightering operations do not take place at onshore 
terminals. The Agency may consider addressing lightering 
operations in a separate source category.

B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 



The pollutants to be regulated are all VOC and HAP 
emitted during marine tank vessel loading and unloading 
operations. 



C. Proposed Standards 



The proposed standards are developed under 
sections 183(f) and 112(d) of the Act. As discussed above, 
section 183(f) requires the promulgation of standards 
implementing reasonably available control technology (RACT). 
Section 112(d) requires the promulgation of maximum 
achievable control technology (MACT), which is selected 
using different criteria than are used for determining RACT. 
As a result, RACT standards developed under section 183(f) 
have somewhat different applicability criteria, as well as a 
different level of emissions reduction, compared to the 
section 112(d) MACT standards. However, the majority of 
requirements (e.g., reporting, recordkeeping, performance 
tests, monitoring) are identical. In order to simplify the 
regulatory process, both sets of standards, RACT and MACT, 
are presented in a single regulation and proposed under 
40 CFR part 63. 



1. Proposed RACT Standards 



Existing and new sources exceeding either of the 
throughput cutoffs of 790 million liters per year (L/yr) 
(5 million barrels per year (bbl/yr)) of gasoline or 
16 billion L/yr (100 million bbl/yr) of crude oil must meet 
the RACT requirement of capture and control of vapors from 
marine vessel loading operations. The EPA believes that 
approximately 25 terminals will be required to install 
controls under these proposed standards. The RACT for 
marine vessel loading operations is a capture system 
consisting of a vapor tight marine vessel and all of the 
piping and equipment necessary to route all VOC vapors to a 
control device connected to either a thermal destruction 
device or a recovery device. If a thermal destruction 
device is used to process vapors, 98 percent destruction 
efficiency must be achieved. If a recovery device is used 
to process the vapors, 95 percent recovery must be achieved, 
or as an alternative, for recovery of gasoline vapor 
emissions, a source must ensure an outlet concentration of 
1,000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) or less. 



2. Proposed MACT Standards 



New marine vessel loading operations exceeding 
1 megagram per year (Mg/yr) (1.1 tons per year) of 
uncontrolled HAP emissions that are located at major sources 
must meet the MACT requirement of capture and control of 
vapors from marine vessel loading operations. The MACT for 
new marine vessel loading operations is a capture system 
consisting of a vapor tight marine vessel and all of the 
piping and equipment necessary to route all VOC vapors to a 
control device that is capable of reducing HAP emissions to 
the atmosphere by 98 percent. 

Existing marine vessel loading operations exceeding 
approximately 1 Mg/yr of HAP emissions that are located at 
major sources must meet the same vessel tightness 
requirements as new sources. The EPA believes that 
approximately 300 terminals will be affected by these 
proposed standards. These operations will have a MACT 
emissions requirement of 93 percent emission reduction. 
Control devices used to achieve this emission limit are 
required to operate at 95- and 98 percent removal 
efficiencies respectively. However, these facilities have 
the option of exempting emissions of one or more commodities 
from control provided an overall 93 percent emission 
reduction is achieved. This overall emission reduction may 
be demonstrated by controlling all but a few commodities 
loaded. Partial control of any given commodity would not be 
allowed under the proposed compliance provisions. 

At both new and existing sources, emissions from 
ballasting operations would be prohibited. Emissions of HAP 
from steam stripping used to regenerate carbon beds when 
carbon adsorption is used to control emissions from marine 
vessel loading operations would also be prohibited under 
today's proposed standards. 



3. Source Reduction and Recycling 



The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508; 
42 U.S.C. 13101 et seq., ER 71:0501) establishes the following 
pollution prevention hierarchy as national policy: 

a. Pollution should be prevented or reduced at the 
source wherever feasible; 

b. Pollution that cannot be prevented should be 
recycled in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
feasible; 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940513-1-00067 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940513-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. Pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled 
should be treated in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
feasible; and 
d. Disposal or other release into the environment 
should be employed only as a last resort and should be 
conducted in an environmentally safe manner. 
Pollution prevention means ``source reduction,'' as 
defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other 
practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of 
pollutants. Source reduction is any practice that reduces 
the amount of any hazardous substance entering the waste 
stream or otherwise released into the environment prior to 
recycling, treatment, or disposal. Source reduction does 
not include any practice which alters the physical, 
chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a 
hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a 
process or activity which itself is not integral to and 
necessary for the production of a product or the providing 
of a service. Under the Pollution Prevention Act, 
recycling, energy recovery, treatment and disposal are not 
included within the definition of pollution prevention. 
Some practices commonly described as ``in-process recycling'' 
may qualify as pollution prevention. 
Pollution prevention principles have been incorporated 
into the proposed marine vessel standards. The proposed 
prohibition of emissions from ballasting and steam stripping 
operations has the effect of preventing pollution from 
occurring at the source. Alternative processes 
(i.e., segregated ballast tanks and vacuum regeneration) are 
readily available, widely used, and have the benefit of not 
resulting in HAP or VOC emissions. 
Although not considered pollution prevention, vapor 
recovery and recycling is a common practice in this 
industry, particularly gasoline recovery (the lower vapor 
pressure crude oils are less conducive to recovery and are 
more likely to foul the carbon bed). The proposed standards 
encourage vapor recovery by allowing the use of well- 
operated and maintained recovery devices that operate at 
95-percent emission reduction. Recovery devices are 
desirable compared to combustion devices because the 
recovered compounds can be reused in other processes, which 
reduces the quantity of virgin materials that must be 
produced. Recovery devices also tend to generate fewer 
secondary pollution impacts than do combustion devices. 


D. Emission Points To Be Regulated 


The emission points to be regulated include all means 
of venting the tank during loading of product or ballast. 
These include, but are not limited to, open hatches and/or 
overhead vent systems. The proposed rulemakings will not 
directly regulate seals, hatches, or covers associated with 
the marine tank vessel. However, these items must be in 
satisfactory condition for the vessel to pass one of the 
three different marine tank vessel tightness tests, and must 
remain closed during the loading process.

E. Format for the Proposed Standards 


The chosen format for the standards for product loading 
is a percentage of mass emissions reduction. An alternative 
format for gasoline vapor recovery, a maximum allowable 
concentration for the vapor processor exhaust is also 
proposed. Emissions are prohibited from ballasting 
operations and from regeneration of carbon adsorber beds. 


F. Compliance Deadline 


The compliance deadline for existing sources affected 
by the RACT standards is 2 years after the date of 
promulgation. The compliance deadline for existing sources 
affected by the MACT standards is 2 years after the date of 
promulgation. An existing source that subsequently exceeds 
a RACT throughput cutoff will have 2 years to comply once 
the source exceeds a throughput cutoff. Similarly, any 
source that exists as of the effective date of the standards 
and subsequently exceeds the MACT applicability thresholds 
would have 2 years to comply with the existing source MACT 
standards. All other new or reconstructed facilities will 
have to comply upon startup, with the exceptions noted in 
 63.6 of the part 63 General Provisions. 


G. Initial Performance Tests 


Owners or operators must perform initial performance 
tests as required by  63.7 of the General Provisions 
for all combustion or recovery devices except devices such 
as boilers or process heaters where the emissions stream is 
the primary fuel or boilers and process heaters having a 
design heat input capacity of 44 megawatts or more. The 
test method for compliance for combustion devices is the EPA 
Method 25 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The test method 
for compliance for recovery devices is the EPA Method 25A of 
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. Flares are not subject to the 
same tests as other control devices, but must pass a visible 
emissions test according to the requirements of Method 22 of 
appendix A of 40 CFR part 60. The performance tests must be 
conducted to include the loading of the last 20 percent of a 
compartment, and may be spread out over multiple 
compartments. 


H. Vessel Tightness Testing 


Three alternatives to ensure vessel tightness are 
proposed: (1) Pressure test the vessel, (2) perform a leak 
test on all components using Method 21 of appendix A of 
40 CFR part 60, or (3) load the vessel at less than 
atmospheric pressure. 


I. Monitoring 


Owners or operators using a vent system that contains 
valves that could divert a vent stream from a control device 
must either monitor vent stream flow to ensure that it is 
not diverted from a control device or secure the bypass line 
valve in the closed position. 
Monitoring criteria have been established for 
combustion devices (except flares), carbon adsorbers, 
condensers and adsorbers. In general, facilities would be 
required to establish operating parameters during the 
initial performance test and then monitor combustion 
temperature for combustion devices, VOC concentration in the 
exhaust stream outlet for carbon adsorbers, exhaust stream 
temperature for condensers, and VOC outlet concentration for 
adsorbers. In the case of flares, owners or operators would 
be required to monitor for the continuous presence of a 
flame and to monitor vent stream flow. Owners or operators 
seeking to use other types of control devices may develop 
enhanced monitoring criteria for these devices and submit 
the criteria to the Administrator for approval. 


J. Recordkeeping and Reporting 


Sources required to install controls would have to 
fulfill the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of the 
part 63 General Provisions including submittal of the 
following reports: (1) Compliance notification report, 
(2) notification of initial performance test, (3) report of 
initial performance test, (4) quarterly parameter exceedance 
report, and (5) quarterly emissions estimation report. 
These sources must also maintain documentation that vessels 
loaded at the facility are vapor tight. All information 
will be made readily available to the Administrator or 
delegated State authority for a minimum of 5 years. 


III. Rationale 


A. Selection of Affected Sources 


The primary release of vapors during the marine tank 
vessel loading process occurs at the tank vessel through 
hatches, vents, and vent systems. However, it is 
impractical for marine tank vessels to carry their own vapor 
processing systems given the limited space on individual 
vessels. It is also much more economical for terminals to 
install and operate control devices that are capable of 
controlling emissions from multiple vessels than for each 
vessel to control its own emissions. Furthermore, 
section 183(f) requires that ``to the extent practicable such 
standards shall apply to loading and unloading facilities 
and not to tank vessels.'' Therefore, these regulations 
require that terminals install an air pollution control 
device and a means of routing the air/vapor mixture from the 
vessel to the air pollution control device. 
Vessels will not be allowed to load or unload product 
unless they are compatible with terminal air pollution 
control systems or have a self contained emissions control 
system on board. Therefore, vessels loading at a controlled 
terminal will need to have their own vapor collection 
systems (i.e., pipes which allow for connection to terminal 
air pollution control system) in order to route vapors to 
shore. However, vessels are not required to load at 
controlled terminals. As a result, the affected source is 
limited to the terminal, which is in turn required to 
capture and control all loading emissions, with the 
exception of ballasting and off-shore terminal emissions 
which are discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Emissions 
from off shore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid transfer 
operations (i.e., lightering operations) are also not 
included as a source affected by these standards because 
these operations do not take place at onshore terminals.

B. Selection of Pollutants To Be Regulated 


Section 183(f) of the Act states that the Administrator shall ``promulgate standards applicable to the emission
of VOC and any other pollutant from loading and unloading of tank vessels which the Administrator finds causes, or
contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' Under section
112(d), the EPA is also required to regulate the emissions of HAP from source categories listed pursuant to section
112(c). Marine vessel loading operations were listed on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 60021). In the absence of regulation,
the EPA estimates that 75,200 Mg/yr of VOC will be emitted as a result of tank vessel loading operations. Approximately
8,000 Mg/yr of these VOC emissions will be emissions of HAP. Tank vessel loading operations emit approximately 53
different substances listed as HAP under section 112(b) of the Act. Such emissions include unregulated benzene emissions
of about 700 Mg/yr. In addition, approximately 6,900 Mg/yr of hexane, toluene, xylene compounds, ethyl benzene,
iso-octane, MTBE, naphthalene, and cumene are emitted from tank vessel loading operations. Approximately 44 HAP
comprise the remaining four percent of toxic emissions. 

Benzene is a known human carcinogen. It has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of nonlymphocytic leukemia
in occupationally exposed individuals. It has also been linked to other leukemias, as well as lymphomas and other
tumor types in animal studies. Benzene has also been associated with a number of adverse noncancer health effects,
including effects on the blood system and the immune system. The other HAP identified above also may induce adverse
health effects, including depression of the central nervous system, upper respiratory tract and eye irritation,
skeletal abnormalities, anemia, cataracts, kidney damage and liver damage. 

As a result of its authority to regulate emission from tank vessel loading operations under both section 183(f) and
section 112(d), the EPA shall regulate emissions of VOC and those HAP included on the list under section 112(b) in this
rulemaking. 



C. Selection of Basis and Level of the RACT Standards 



1. Development of Regulatory Alternatives 



In deciding how to implement the RACT provisions of section 183(f), the EPA had to determine whether or not all tank
vessel loading terminals should be subject to the standards (i.e., whether there should be ``cutoffs'' below which
a terminal would not be subject to the standards) and what level of control would be appropriate. Consistent with the
requirements of section 183(f) calling for the consideration of costs and other non-air quality impacts, as well
as the general requirements under RACT to review economic feasibility, the EPA believes that section 183(f) gives
the EPA the flexibility to determine the level and scope of regulation that is most appropriate for terminal facilities,
given all of the factors indicated. 

Assuming 100 percent capture of emissions (which can be assumed when vapor tight vessels are loaded), the overall
level of control is determined by the efficiency of the control device to which emissions are ducted. Currently, recovery
devices (e.g., carbon adsorption, absorption, vapor balancing and refrigeration) are capable of achieving a 95
percent efficiency compared to a 98 percent efficiency achieved by thermal destruction (combustion) devices (e.g.,
flares, enclosed flares, and thermal and catalytic incinerators). Additional information and descriptions of
these control technologies are found in the TSD for this rulemaking (see 

ADDRESSES

 section). For purposes of the regulatory alternative analysis, the use of a thermal destruction device (i.e., 98
percent efficiency) was assumed. The control technologies selected for this regulation are discussed in part 4 below.


The next step was to identify regulatory alternatives that would allow the EPA to choose among different optimal cutoffs
specifying what types of terminals would have to install control devices. The EPA chose commodity and throughput
as factors to distinguish among alternatives because commodities with higher vapor pressures have higher emissions
and, for a given commodity, terminals with higher throughput loading similar vessels have higher emissions. 

Table 1 is a summary of the five regulatory alternatives developed by the EPA. The regulatory alternatives varied
in stringency from controlling all emissions at all facilities to controlling only gasoline loadings at terminals
with annual throughputs greater than 1,590 million liters (10 million bbl/yr) and crude oil terminals with throughputs
greater than 15,900 million liters/yr (100 million bbl/yr). The control levels are all based on the capture of loading
emissions from marine vessels and a 98 percent removal efficiency. Each regulatory alternative is structured such
that the emissions and resulting cost-effectiveness values from each commodity at the stated throughput are roughly
equivalent. For example, the costs of controlling emissions from 10 million barrels of gasoline is treated as being
roughly equivalent to the costs of controlling emissions from 100 million barrels of crude oil because the emissions
per volume of gasoline is ten times higher than for crude oil. (For a more complete rationale behind the selection of
the regulatory alternatives, consult the technical support document (TSD) previously mentioned in the 

ADDRESSES

 section.)

The analysis leading to a decision to regulate 
emissions from ballasting and steam stripping operations is 
presented in section D, Selection of MACT Regulatory 
Approach. 


2. Impacts of the Regulatory Alternatives 


The EPA developed model (i.e., example) vessels and 
terminals for use in estimating the environmental, cost, and 
economic impacts associated with the actual terminals 
represented by the waterborne commerce in the United States 
(WCUS) data base. The impacts that resulted from this 
analysis are presented in Tables 1 through 3. The EPA 
performed an economic impact analysis of the regulatory 
alternatives considered for these regulations. Potential 
price, output, and employment impacts for affected products 
and for the marine transport industry and for small 
businesses were examined. Estimated maximum price increases 
for any product loaded in bulk varied but were not large 
under any of the regulatory alternatives. These price 
increase estimates reflect the control cost increase for 
both transporting crude and transporting refined products. 
Because the price increases are small and because the 
elasticities of demand for petroleum products are small, 
estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were 
minimal in all but Regulatory Alternative V. 
Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions were also 
small (less than 20) in all but Regulatory Alternative V.

Because today's proposed regulation involves the 
application of both RACT and MACT, impacts for each standard 
were determined separately. In order to avoid 
overestimation or double-counting, and because the 
requirements for RACT are more stringent than MACT, the 
impacts for facilities affected by RACT (i.e., facilities 
with gasoline throughputs of greater than 790 million L/yr 
(5 million bbl/yr) or crude oil throughputs of greater than 
16 billion L/yr (100 million bbl/yr)) were calculated first, 
and were discounted when determining the impacts for 
facilities affected by MACT (i.e., facilities emitting 
greater than 1 Mg/yr of HAP). 



3. RACT Threshold Determination 



The Administrator is proposing Regulatory Alternative 
II as the regulatory threshold for the RACT standard. 
Regulatory Alternative II would require controls for crude 
oil loadings at facilities with an crude oil marine 
throughput of approximately 15,900 L/yr (100 million bbl/yr) 
or more, and gasoline loadings at facilities with a gasoline 
throughput of approximately 795 million L/yr (5 million 
bbl/yr). Approximately 25 terminals (1.5 percent of all 
terminals) will be affected if the thresholds for Regulatory 
Alternative II are implemented. In addition, under this 
alternative, only a small volume of U.S. marine vessels will 
need to be retrofitted. It is anticipated that only those 
vessels that are least costly to retrofit would be 
retrofitted. Approximately 76 percent of the VOC emissions 
from all marine terminals would be controlled at an average 
cost effectiveness of approximately $770/Mg of VOC reduced 
under Regulatory Alternative II. 

The Administrator believes that the incremental cost 
effectiveness ($5,000/Mg) of going beyond Regulatory 
Alternative II is inappropriate given this standard. 

Regulatory Alternative III was strongly considered. 
However, the additional 35 terminals controlled under 
Regulatory Alternative III would produce only an additional 
eight percent reduction in nationwide emissions. Of those 
35 additional terminals, as many as 25 could be under 
increased competitive pressure, compared to only up to 
five terminals under Regulatory Alternative II. (Increased 
competitive pressure refers to the situation where the 
controlled terminal is in direct competition with a much 
smaller or larger terminal. The smaller terminal may not be 
controlled and the larger terminal may be able to control 
vapors more effectively on a per-barrel basis. The 
controlled terminal could be forced to absorb some of the 
control costs, reduce throughput, substitute nonregulated 
products, or close the facility.) 

Additionally, the more stringent regulatory 
alternatives considered involved control of commodities 
which have vapor pressures much lower than gasoline and 
crude oil. Emissions generally correspond to the vapor 
pressure of the commodity being loaded. Gasoline and crude 
oil generally have the highest vapor pressures, and 
therefore present better control alternatives. Because the 
economic and other environmental impacts of Regulatory 
Alternative II are reasonable and should not place an undue 
burden on industry or the environment, the Administrator 
selected Regulatory Alternative II as representative of 
RACT. 



4. Selection of Emission Control Technologies and 
Emission Control Standards for RACT 



Control of marine vessel loading emissions requires the 
capture of displaced vapors and efficient control of vapors 
once captured. Vessels loading at facilities with controls 
must install a vapor collection system and pass one of three 
tank vessel tightness alternatives to ensure good capture of 
vapors. The tightness alternative may be one of the 
following: (1) A leak check performed during loading on all 
components using Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60; 
(2) a pressure test, where the internal tanks are 
pressurized and the pressure drop is monitored over time to 
determine if the vessel is tight; or (3) for noninerted 
vessels (i.e., vessels having tanks that are not blanketed 
with nonreactive gas during loading to ensure that vapors in 
the tanks are below the explosive range), load the vessel at 
less than atmospheric pressure. These tightness 
alternatives are the same as those promulgated in the NESHAP 
for benzene (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). The EPA does not 
have sufficient data necessary to determine at what point 
vessel leaks affect the operation and efficiency of the 
control system; however, the Agency believes that the three 
tightness alternatives proposed are sufficient to provide 
for the collection of nearly all displaced vapors. The EPA 
believes that once assured of good capture and collection of 
the vapors through the tightness tests, facilities can 
concentrate on the operation and maintenance of the control 
device as a means of ensuring compliance. 

The EPA is proposing that vapor emissions captured from 
marine tank vessel loading operations can be controlled 
using one of two primary methods: Combustion or recovery. 
The primary devices used for combustion of vapors are 
flares, enclosed flares (often referred to as thermal 
oxidizers), catalytic incinerators, and thermal 
incinerators. The primary methods for recovery of vapors 
include carbon adsorption, absorption, refrigeration, and 
vapor balancing. In States with marine tank vessel loading 
standards that allow both combustion and recovery, the 
control devices are evenly split between enclosed flares and 
carbon adsorption.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940513-1-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940513-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The EPA is proposing that standards for the control of 
vapors captured during the loading operations be one of the 
following: (1) A combustion device meeting 98 percent or 
greater destruction efficiency or (2) A recovery device 
meeting 95 percent or greater recovery efficiency. The 
difference in control efficiencies between recovery and 
combustion is designed to not prohibit recovery systems, 
which have smaller secondary air emission (sulfur dioxide, 
nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide) impacts than combustion 
systems. The smaller emissions reduction is also warranted 
because these emissions are recovered as product instead of 
destroyed. Additionally, the EPA has data supporting the 
95- and 98-percent control efficiencies as achievable for 
recovery and combustion devices, respectively 
(Docket A-90-44, items II-A-7 and II-B-1). 

For terminals that use recovery devices for control of 
gasoline vapor emissions, the EPA is proposing an 
alternative means of compliance. Such sources can comply by 
ensuring an outlet concentration of 1,000 ppmv or less for 
emissions from gasoline loadings. The EPA believes the 
1,000 ppmv limit for gasoline vapor is generally more strict 
than the 95 percent reduction requirement. Data from an 
existing facility show this limit to be achievable 
(Docket A-90-44, item II-B-13). The intent of the 
concentration alternative is to allow those facilities that 
operate at a higher efficiency than required by the proposed 
standard to perform a simpler compliance test, as they would 
only have to test at the outlet of the control device. 
Because of the lower emission factors associated with crude 
oil emissions, the fact that hydrogen sulfide present in 
crude oil may poison the activated carbon, and that there 
are no known facilities controlling crude oil emissions with 
carbon adsorbers, the EPA is not proposing a concentration 
alternative for controlling vapors from crude oil emissions. 



5. Impacts of the Proposed RACT Standards 



The environmental, costs, energy, and economic impacts 
of the proposed RACT standards are summarized in Tables 1 
through 3, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative II. 
They are also discussed in parts C.2. and C.3. above. 
Economic effects of the proposed RACT standards include a 
maximum price increase of approximately 0.2 percent and 
nationwide employment reductions of less than fifty. Up to 
five terminals controlled under the proposed standards could 
be under increased competitive pressure. Economic effects 
on oil tankers include an average control cost per barrel of 
crude oil loaded equal to $0.002. 

A primary concern in the implementation of the proposed 
standards is safety. Section 183(f)(1) dictates that the 
EPA consult with the Coast Guard and consider safety when 
promulgating these standards. Section 183(f)(2) states: 





Regulations on Equipment Safety._Within 6 months 
after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990, the Secretary of the Department in which 
the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to 
ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are 
to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank 
vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 of the United States 
Code and section 6 of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act 
(33 U.S.C. 1225). The standards promulgated by the 
Administrator under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued 
by a State or political subdivision regarding emissions from 
the loading and unloading of tank vessels shall be 
consistent with the regulations regarding safety of the 
Department in which the Coast Guard is operating. 




The Coast Guard regulations (55 FR 25396) were 
promulgated in June 1990, before the passage of the amended 
Act. These standards dictate equipment, system, and 
operational requirements for vapor control systems for 
benzene, gasoline, and crude oil. The EPA has maintained 
communication with the Coast Guard throughout the rulemaking 
process. All control systems installed as a result of this 
proposed regulation would be subject to the Coast Guard 
regulations, and nothing in the proposed standard should be 
construed as to require any act or omission that would be in 
violation of any regulation or other requirements of the 
United States Coast Guard or prevent any act or omission 
necessary to secure the safety of a vessel or for saving 
life at sea. Representatives from the United States Coast 
Guard have participated in all phases of the development of 
these proposed rules. The EPA is confidant that these 
regulations are consistent with the Coast Guard regulations 
and that the safety factors have been adequately addressed. 



6. Attainment/Nonattainment Status and Site Specific 
Risk Assessment 



At one time, the Agency was considering planning 
regulating based exclusively under the authority of section 
183(f). During this time, the Agency held a public meeting 
to discuss a possible approach for considering a facility's 
attainment/non-attainment status with respect to NAAQS ozone 
program and a facility's site specific risk to the public in 
developing the standards (see Docket A-90-44, item II-E-42). 
This approach would have required intensive effort on the 
part of the Agency and the regulated community to develop 
acceptable criteria and technological methodologies for 
demonstrating whether the criteria have been met. However, 
with regulation under section 112, any facility that might 
have been exempted from RACT under section 183(f) with the 
approach discussed at the public meeting would ultimately be 
regulated under the MACT standards of section 112. 
Therefore, no further consideration was given to this 
approach.

1. Area Source Finding 


The HAP emitted from this source category include 
benzene, toluene, hexane, xylene, and ethylbenzene from 
gasoline and crude oil loading as well as approximately 
60 HAP from alcohols and specialty chemicals. Of the 
approximately 1,800 marine vessel terminals in this source 
category, at least 60 emit 25 ton/year of HAP or more, and 
are therefore considered major sources. In addition, under 
section 112(a)(1), a marine vessel terminal may be a part of 
a major source if it is part of a ``group of stationary 
sources located within a contiguous area and under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit considering 
controls, in the aggregate, 10 tons per year or more of any 
hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons per year or more of any 
combination of hazardous air pollutants.'' There are 
approximately 600 refineries and chemical production 
facilities in the United States; all of these are considered 
to be major sources. While the Agency does not have the 
data in its marine vessel data base to estimate how many of 
these facilities have bulk marine loading terminals that are 
contiguous to and under the same control as the main 
facility, there is a high correlation between large 
refineries and production facilities and large bulk loading 
terminals. Therefore, at a minimum, for purposes of this 
analysis, the Agency assumed that approximately 
300 terminals are major sources because they are likely to 
be located at major sources such as refineries or chemical 
production facilities. This leaves approximately 
1,200 facilities that are considered likely area sources. 
Based on the emissions data contained in the Agency's data 
base, these 1,200 facilities represent only 2 percent of 
nationwide HAP emissions. 
Section 112(c)(3) states that categories of area 
sources emitting HAP may be listed and regulated if the 
Administrator finds the sources, individually or in the 
aggregate, present a threat of adverse effects to human 
health or the environment. Based on limited data available 
to the Agency, the Administrator is unable to determine a 
threat of adverse effects at this time. Therefore, the 
Agency is proposing not to regulate such area sources in 
this rulemaking. This is consistent with the Agency's 
decision not to include in its initial list of source 
categories those categories that contained no major sources 
and for which the Agency had not made a finding of threat of 
adverse effects (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992). The Agency 
may, however, revisit these sources in the future, if 
additional data become available. 


2. Determination of Subcategories 


The source category to be regulated is major sources of 
marine vessel loading and unloading operations. As part of 
the NESHAP development process, the source category was 
evaluated to determine if subcategorization of the source 
category was justified. Although the Act does not specify 
the criteria from which subcategories can be developed, 
section 112(d)(1) of the Act states that the ``Administrator 
may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources 
within a category or subcategory * * *.'' The Agency believes 
that these same criteria are acceptable criteria to use in 
making subcategory determinations. 
Size appears to be a likely candidate for a 
distinguishing feature, and using total estimated HAP 
emissions as an indicator for size, the EPA evaluated marine 
tank vessel loading operations to determine whether it was 
appropriate to subcategorize the source category on the 
basis of size. The limit for determining subcategories was 
examined in 0.5 Mg increments of HAP emissions from 
0.5 Mg/yr to 2.0 Mg/yr. A subcategory based on 1 Mg of 
HAP emissions per year was selected for the following 
reasons. First, facilities that emit less than 1 Mg of 
emissions are likely to be area sources and therefore not 
subject to the proposed standards, or are facilities that 
are represented by relatively minimal, episodic emissions. 
For example, a typical river barge holds 10,000 barrels or 
420,000 gallons of gasoline. An uncontrolled facility below 
a 1-Mg cutoff could be loading less than 30 barges per year. 
These facilities also typically emit less frequently than 
facilities emitting more than 1 Mg/yr and typically only 
load a single commodity. Additionally, these facilities 
also tend to load (and therefore emit) commodities having 
lower vapor pressures than commodities loaded at other, 
larger, facilities. Also, facilities that emit 1 Mg or more 
of HAP emissions contribute approximately 98 percent of HAP 
emissions to the national inventory. (See Docket A-90-44)

3. Determination of the MACT Floor 


The MACT floors were determined for the following types 
of operations: Product loading and ballasting. 
a. 

Product loading.

 The marine vessel data base is 
based on throughput data for marine vessel loading 
terminals. The throughput data are divided into crude oil, 
gasoline, and 11 other commodity categories. Additional 
information on these data are available in the TSD for this 
proposed regulation (see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this 
preamble). The EPA estimated the emissions of HAP from each 
of these terminals using these throughput data and 
incorporating assumptions about how many of these facilities 
were controlled, and the extent of their control. These 
assumptions are based on existing Federal and State 
regulations. For example, benzene loadings are already 
controlled by the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61, subpart 
BB). In addition, four States have regulations requiring 
control of emissions from marine tank vessel loading 
operations: New Jersey, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and 
California (District regulations). (Additional information 
on the derivation of the MACT floor is found in 
Docket A-90-44, item II-A-44.) Additional discussion of the 
Agency's interpretation of the MACT floor is presented in 
section J. Solicitation of Comments. 
Of the approximately 360 terminals estimated to be 
affected by the proposed regulation, 43 facilities comprise 
the best performing 12 percent of facilities used in 
calculating the MACT floor for terminals emitting over 1 Mg 
of HAP emissions. These terminals are subject to State 
regulations in California, New Jersey, and Louisiana. 
Averaging the required control levels of these facilities 
results in a MACT floor of 93 percent control for facilities 
emitting more than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Although this 
derived average does not precisely match a control 
technology, for all practical purposes it is equivalent the 
emission reduction achieved by recovery techniques 
(i.e., 95 percent). Additional information on the 
derivation of the MACT floor may be found in the docket for 
this proposed rulemaking effort. 
There are approximately 1,440 facilities that would 
emit less than 1 Mg of HAP emissions annually if 
uncontrolled. The average control level of the best 
performing 12 percent of facilities is 36 percent control. 
This control level does not represent an existing 
technology. Therefore using the average of the best 
performing 12 percent is inappropriate for establishing the 
MACT floor. Taking the median of the best performing 
12 percent of these sources (94th percentile) results in a 
control level of zero because the median facility is 
uncontrolled. This is a more appropriate portrayal of the 
level of control that exists in this subcategory. 
Therefore, this level of control (i.e., no control) 
represents the MACT floor for terminals emitting less than 
1 Mg/yr. 
The MACT floor for new facilities, regardless of size, 
is a 98-percent overall control of emissions. This control 
level represents the best performing similar source. The 
Agency will take comment on whether the MACT floor for new 
sources could, consistent with the requirements of section 
112(d) of the Act, be equal to a control requirement of 
95 percent when a recovery device is used. As discussed 
elsewhere in this preamble, the Agency wishes to encourage 
the use of recovery devices. However, a 95 percent 
reduction requirement for recovery devices may be considered 
inconsistent with the requirement of section 112(d)(3) of 
the Act that emission standards for new sources shall not be 
less stringent than the emission control achieved by the 
best controlled similar source. The EPA requests comments 
on whether the secondary benefits of recovery devices 
provide the Administrator with the ability to determine that 
a 95 percent reduction requirement for those sources using 
recovery is ``not less stringent'' than a 98 percent reduction 
requirement for all other sources. 
b. 

Ballasting.

 According to the Marine Board report, 
most tankships have segregated or clean ballast tanks due to 
Coast Guard regulations and international agreements that 
effectively prohibit ballast emissions from occurring. 
Since the Marine Board report was issued in 1987, as older 
vessels have been retired, the proportion of ``uncontrolled'' 
vessels has decreased further. However, the Agency does not 
have any information available to it to evaluate the 
percentage of vessels that still emit ballasting emissions, 
particularly those vessels that are not in crude oil service 
(where the vast majority of ballasting occurs). The 
Administrator determined that the MACT floor for ballasting 
at new or existing sources would be a prohibition of 
ballasting emissions. The Agency is requesting comment on 
this decision to prohibit ballasting emissions. 


E. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed MACT 
Standards 


1. Development of Regulatory Alternatives 


a. 

Product loading.

 Two regulatory alternatives were 
developed for the subcategory represented by major source 
marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations that 
emit less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP annually. The 
regulatory alternatives are summarized in Table 4. The 
first alternative, Regulatory Alternative A, represents the 
MACT floor of no control. Regulatory Alternative B 
represents the control of a facility's total HAP throughput 
resulting in an overall emission reduction of 95 percent. 
Two regulatory alternatives were considered for the 
subcategory represented by existing facilities emitting more 
than 1 Mg of HAP per year. Regulatory Alternative A 
represents the MACT floor level of control (93 percent 
overall control). Regulatory Alternative B represents the 
control of a facility's total HAP throughput to an overall 
control of 95 percent. 
There are no regulatory alternatives for new facilities 
that exceed the MACT floor of 98 percent control because no 
other alternatives that are more stringent than the floor 
were considered technically feasible.

3. MACT Determination 



a. 

Product loading.

_(1). 

Existing sources emitting 1 Mg/yr or less.

 Under Regulatory Alternative B, the average cost effectiveness to control existing facilities emitting less than
1 Mg/yr of HAP is approximately $3.4 million per Mg. The Administrator has determined that these costs are unreasonable
and, as a result, that MACT for the subcategory represented by 
existing facilities with emissions less than or equal to 1 Mg per year of HAP emissions is equivalent to a MACT floor
of no control. This determination follows section 112(d) of the Act where the Administrator is required to consider
cost of achieving emission reductions beyond the MACT floor (among other criteria) when selecting MACT. These smaller
facilities represent only 2 percent of all industry-wide emissions. 

(2). 

Existing sources emitting greater Than 1 Mg/yr.

 The Administrator has determined that MACT for the subcategory represented by existing facilities with HAP emissions
exceeding 1 Mg per year is the MACT floor of 93 percent overall control. The incremental benefits of additional control
are not justified considering the costs of achieving these reductions. 

The bulk of the incremental costs of control beyond the 93 percent emission limit (MACT floor) are the costs to retrofit
a sufficient number of vessels to capture emissions beyond those required at the MACT floor and supplemental operating
costs. Unfortunately, the Agency's marine vessel data base does not contain the type of data needed to analyze the
nationwide cost effectiveness of a more stringent alternative. However, the average cost per 
facility to retrofit sufficient vessels to allow the facility to comply with the incremental emission reduction
required for that facility to meet standards beyond the MACT floor ranges from approximately $9,000 to $60,000 per
year. (Additional information on this analysis is found in Docket A-90-44, item II-A-23 and item
II-A-32). In addition, there may be substantial additional costs to the facility to equip additional emission
points (e.g., berths) with emission control equipment. The Administrator deems that any costs beyond the MACT floor,
which itself has a cost effectiveness of over $90,000 per Mg, would not be reasonable. (The statute itself precludes
the Administrator from selecting a less costly MACT floor.) Based on this 
limited analysis, the Administrator has elected to not require control beyond the MACT floor for this subcategory.


The selection of 93 percent emission limit as MACT for existing sources emitting greater than 1 Mg/yr should provide
flexibility to terminals that install control equipment that is expected to achieve 95 to 98 percent 
emissions reduction. This flexibility enables facilities to control HAP emissions in the most efficient manner
by not requiring the control of liquids having minimal emissions. The Agency is soliciting comment on the need for
this flexibility, and on methods to ensure enforceability of these standards given this flexibility. 

It should be noted that the EPA does not believe that the analysis performed above for MACT-regulated facilities is
applicable to the determination of RACT discussed in section III-C. The EPA believes that the incremental benefits
of controlling the MACT-regulated terminals above 
93 percent control is unjustified, given the costs already associated with the MACT standard. On the other hand, the
RACT standards apply only to the largest crude oil and gasoline terminals in the United States. The cost effectiveness
associated with requiring 95 or 98 percent control at these facilities is considerably more favorable than that associated
with requiring 95 or 98 percent control for the MACT-regulated facilities. As shown above, the cost effectiveness
associated with the RACT standard is $2,100/Mg, considerably less than that for the MACT standard. Therefore, the
Agency believes that it is not appropriate to reduce the percent reduction requirements of the RACT standard to match
those of the MACT standard. The EPA recognizes that for some individual facilities regulated under both sections
112 and 183(f), the RACT standard may be more stringent than the MACT standard. The EPA believes 
that this result is appropriate, but the EPA is taking comment on this issue. The EPA also notes that the control equipment
required under both the MACT standard and the RACT standard must meet the 95 or 98 percent control threshold. The MACT
standard offers flexibility with regard to the type 
of liquids controlled, not the manner in which they are controlled.

(3). 

New sources. 

The Administrator has determined 
that MACT for new facilities is the MACT floor, which is an 
overall control requirement of 98 percent. However, as 
discussed above, the EPA will take comment on whether MACT 
for new facilities could, consistent with section 112(d) of 
the Act, be equal to 95 percent reduction for recovery 
devices and 98 percent reduction for other destruction 
devices. 

b. 

Ballasting. 

The Administrator believes that the 
combined impact of fleet turnover and Coast Guard and other 
regulatory requirements for tankships to use segregated 
ballast tanks means that there should be no impacts from the 
control (i.e., prohibition) of ballast emissions. As a 
result, MACT was determined to be equivalent to a 
prohibition of emissions from ballasting. However, as 
discussed in section J.2, Ballasting Emissions, the 
Administrator is soliciting comments and data on the 
possibility of significant impacts to currently uncontrolled 
vessels. 



4. Selection of the Proposed MACT Standards 



a. 

Product loading. 

As with the RACT standards, 
vessels loading at facilities with controls must install a 
vapor collection system and pass one of three tank vessel 
tightness alternatives. 

The MACT standards for existing facilities are based on 
a facility demonstrating that 93 percent of HAP emissions 
are controlled. Facilities would be allowed to demonstrate 
that the standard is being met in one of two ways. In the 
first case, a facility may choose to demonstrate that 
emissions from all vessels being loaded at the facility are 
being routed to either a 95 percent efficient recovery 
device or a 98 percent efficient destruction device. In the 
other case, the facility may opt to exclude the emissions of 
certain vessels or process lines from control, based on 
documented emission estimates, so long as at least a 93 
percent overall level of control is achieved. The partial 
control of any commodity loaded or unloaded at the terminal 
would not be allowed as a means of showing compliance with 
the 93 percent overall emissions reduction standard. The 
facility would still be required to demonstrate that all 
controlled emissions are being routed to either a 95 percent 
efficient recovery device or a 98 percent efficient 
destruction device. 

The MACT standards for new facilities require an 
emissions limit of 98 percent control. Additionally, these 
facilities would be required to maintain tank-tight vessels 
while loading. 

b. 

Ballasting. 

Owners or operators of existing and 
new marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations 
would be required to demonstrate compliance with the 
ballasting standards by maintaining records showing that the 
vessels loaded met one of the following criteria: (1) The 
vessel does not perform ballasting at any time, (2) the 
vessel meets the Coast Guard standards, or (3) ballasting 
emissions are ducted to a control device. 


5. Impacts of the Proposed MACT Standards 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940513-1-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940513-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The environmental, costs, energy and economic impacts 
of the proposed MACT standards are summarized in Tables 4 
through 6, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative A 
for facilities emitting less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP 
and Regulatory Alternative A for facilities emitting more 
than 1 Mg of HAP. There are no projected impacts to 
controlling emissions from ballasting. 

As discussed in section IV.C.5, the EPA believes that 
the potential safety impacts of the standards have been 
addressed. 

The estimated impacts of the standards are a VOC 
reduction of 12,400 Mg/yr of which 1,300 Mg are HAP. The 
capital and annualized costs are estimated to be 
$570 million and $130 million, respectively. 

The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the 
MACT determination for this regulation. Potential price, 
output, and employment impacts for affected producers and 
for the marine transport industry were examined for each 
alternative. Potential small business impacts were also 
isolated. Additional information on these economic impacts 
is available in the docket for this proposed regulation. 

Estimated maximum price increases for the affected 
products varied but were not large (less than 1 percent) for 
any of the products under Regulatory Alternative A of the 
MACT determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr. 
These price increase estimates reflect both the control cost 
increase for transporting crude oil and the control cost 
increase for transporting petroleum products. Because these 
price increases are small and because the elasticity of 
demand coefficients for petroleum products are small, 
estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were 
minimal. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions 
were also small (less than 200). 

Under Regulatory Alternative A of the MACT 
determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr, 
potentially significant economic impacts on the smaller 
terminal operations that would have to install controls were 
identified. These significant impacts may have resulted 
from the high costs overall acting in combination with high 
per-barrel control cost differentials between the smaller 
and larger terminal operations that would have to control. 
It is expected that many of the smaller terminal operations 
would not be able to pass all of their control costs forward 
to consumers since they would be under increased competitive 
pressure from the larger terminal operations. It was 
estimated that up to 200 of the 264 affected terminal 
operations will have difficulty either absorbing control 
costs or passing along these costs to consumers under the 
proposed standard. 

The potential economic impact on marine vessel owners 
is relatively small. Average control cost per barrel for 
tankers shipping crude oil or refined products was estimated 
to be $0.002 per barrel while owners or barges shipping 
refined products would face control costs of $0.08 per 
barrel. Because 77 percent of U.S. marine-transported 
petroleum product volume would be affected by these proposed 
standards, a significant percentage of U.S. marine vessels 
will need to be retrofitted. The vessels least costly to 
modify (most likely the larger, newer, double-skin vessels) 
will be retrofitted first, leading to a significant degree 
of dedicated service. It is expected that vessel owners 
that do retrofit will be able to pass retrofit costs forward 
to consumers. 

As discussed above, a primary concern in the 
implementation of these proposed regulations is safety. 
Though section 112 of the Act does not specifically address 
U.S. Coast Guard regulations on safety, the EPA has 
endeavored to make sure that safety factors are adequately 
addressed and that nothing in the proposed regulations, 
whether proposed under section 183(f) or 112, is 
inconsistent with current U.S. Coast Guard regulations. 

In addition, section 183(f)(2) of the Act requires that 
any regulations promulgated by any State or political 
subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and 
unloading of tank vessels must be consistent with U.S. Coast 
Guard regulations regarding safety. This consistency 
requirement is equally applicable to any State or local 
regulation promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air 
Act section 112. Moreover, section 112(l) requires that the 
Administrator disapprove any program submitted by a State if 
the Administrator determines that the program is not likely 
to satisfy the objectives of the Act. The EPA believes that 
any State or local program that is inconsistent with 
U.S. Coast Guard safety regulations is ``not likely to 
satisfy the objectives of the Act'' and would therefore be 
disapproved by the Administrator. 



F. Selection of Format for the Standards 



The chosen format for the standards is a percent of 
mass emissions reduction. The percent of mass reduction 
format allows a focus on the final control device after good 
capture has been ensured. This approach is consistent with 
the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). Sufficient 
data to develop a mass per unit loaded standard were not 
available. Additionally, emission rates can vary between 
facilities and between vessels based on loading temperature 
and the arrival condition of the vessel, making it difficult 
to set an acceptable mass per unit loaded standard while 
ensuring good capture and control. Developing a mass per 
unit loaded standard would have required extensive testing 
and would need to be more stringent than the percent of mass 
reduction format in order to accommodate the varying 
terminal and vessel conditions. For this reason, a mass per 
unit loaded alternative is not being proposed. 

The primary format, mass emissions reduction, for the 
MACT standards is the same as the RACT standards. However, 
because the MACT standards allow the source the flexibility 
to control only the portion of total facility emissions 
needed to meet the 93 percent reduction requirement, 
facilities may choose to calculate both potential 
uncontrolled and actual controlled emissions as part of the 
compliance demonstration.

<PARENT> FR940513-1-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Emissions from ballasting operations would be 
prohibited. 



G. Selection of Test Methods 



The proposed standards require the use of approved test 
methods to ensure consistent and verifiable results for 
initial performance tests and compliance demonstrations. 

Different test methods are specified for combustion and 
recovery devices. For combustion devices, Method 25 of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A (Method 25) has been specified. 
Method 25 is appropriate for measuring the VOC destruction 
efficiency of combustion devices whose output is greater 
than 50 ppmv. Given the large inlet concentrations 
associated with marine loadings, outlet concentrations of 
less than 50 ppmv are not expected. 

For recovery devices, (Method 25A) of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A (Method 25A) has been specified. The 
(Method 25A) is appropriate for measuring the VOC removal 
efficiency of a nondestructive control device. Method 25A 
may be used for testing both removal efficiency and outlet 
concentration. 

Because emissions and control efficiency also vary 
during the loading cycle, the EPA has determined that 
performance tests should be conducted to include the loading 
of the last 20 percent of a compartment, and may be spread 
out over multiple compartments. Data show that the greatest 
emissions occur during the last 20 percent of loading of a 
tank or compartment. The EPA believes that the control 
equipment should be designed to handle the peak loading 
emissions, which occur during this period. 




The proposed standards also allow the use of any test 
method or test results validated according to the protocol 
in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A to allow owners 
or operators greater flexibility in testing. 




Under today's proposed standards, owners or operators 
not having documentation of vessel vapor tightness would be 
required to test the vapor tightness of vessels using a 
pressure test provided in the regulation, or a leak test 
provided in Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Methods are also provided for owners or operators loading 
under negative pressure. These test methods were first 
proposed for owners or operators of benzene transfer 
operations on September 14, 1989 (54 FR 38083) and were 
promulgated on March 7, 1990 (55 FR 8292). In the proposal 
of the benzene transfer operations NESHAP, comments were 
specifically requested regarding the suitability of these 
methods for these sources. Based on the comments received 
on these methods and the Agency's knowledge of the use of 
these methods under the benzene transfer NESHAP, the Agency 
is confident that these methods are suitable for determining 
vapor tightness for today's proposed regulation. 




Regarding the emission estimation procedures to be 
followed in determining compliance with the proposed 
standards, the Agency is proposing that facilities use 
either actual test data or AP-42 emissions factors to 
identify emissions from the various commodities and streams 
loaded. The Agency is requesting comment on this approach 
for estimating emissions. 




H. Selection of Monitoring and Compliance 
and Performance Testing Requirements 




The proposed standards list parameters to be monitored 
for the purpose of determining compliance. Monitoring 
requirements are proposed for both the vapor collection 
system and control devices. The vapor collection system 
monitoring requirements ensure that vent streams will not be 
diverted from the control device through the use of flow 
indicators or routine inspection of secured by-pass lines. 
While many forms of monitoring may qualify as enhanced 
monitoring, enhanced monitoring for tank vessel loading 
vapor control systems will generally be limited to a 
continuous control device parameter monitoring system, a 
continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), portable 
monitors, or a combination thereof. 




The monitoring criterion for carbon adsorption is a 
CEMS for VOC concentration at the exhaust to atmosphere. 
The compliance condition will be no exceedance of the 
average concentration demonstrated during the facility's 
last compliance test. This monitoring criteria does not 
correspond precisely to the 95 percent reduction 
requirement, however it will be less costly to install and 
maintain than a system monitoring inlet and outlet and 
calculating removal efficiency. 




The monitoring parameter for combustion devices, except 
flares, is combustion temperature. Combustion temperature 
is a strong indicator of performance. The temperature to be 
maintained will be determined from the facility's compliance 
test. For compliance purposes, temperature variation is 
limited to 

#

5.6
 C (

#

10
 F) compared to the average 
temperature during the most recent compliance test. 




The monitoring parameter for condensers is the exhaust 
stream temperature. Exhaust temperature directly correlates 
to exhaust concentration and is easier to monitor than 
outlet concentration. Coolant temperature was not chosen 
because it provides no guarantee of heat transfer efficiency 
or control efficiency. As with combustion devices, 
temperature deviations from the operating parameters 
established during the most recent compliance test are 
limited to 

#

5.6
 C (

#

10
 F). 




The monitoring requirements for flares are established 
in 40 CFR 60.18, which requires the owner or operator to 
monitor for the presence of a flame at all times. 



The monitoring parameters for absorbers are the 
temperature and specific gravity of the scrubbing liquid. 
Deviations from the operating parameters established during 
the most recent compliance test are limited to 11
 C (20
 F) 
above the baseline scrubbing liquid temperature and 


#

0.1 unit from the baseline scrubbing liquid specific 
gravity respectively. 




Finally, in order to not prohibit the use of other 
control devices or new technology, a facility not using a 
control device for which enhanced monitoring criteria have 
been included may develop its own monitoring criteria and 
submit them to the Administrator for approval. 

The Agency is also proposing alternative means of 
monitoring compliance with the standards at terminals using 
recovery devices for control of gasoline vapor emissions. 
These terminals would monitor the outlet concentration of 
VOC from the recovery device. Compliance with the standards 
is indicated provided that the VOC concentration is 
1,000 ppmv or less. The EPA believes the 1,000 ppmv limit 
for gasoline vapor is generally more strict than the 
95-percent control device efficiency requirement. Data from 
an existing facility show this limit to be achievable 
(Docket A-90-44, item II-B-13). The intent of the 
concentration alternative is to allow those facilities that 
operate at a higher efficiency than required by the proposed 
standard to perform a simpler compliance test, as they would 
only have to test at the outlet of the control device. The 
EPA does not have sufficient data to determine a ppmv 
emission limit for controlling VOC vapors from crude oil 
emissions. Nor does the EPA have sufficient data to 
determine a ppmv emission limit for controlling HAP vapors 
from crude oil emissions or other commodities. The EPA is 
soliciting data and comments regarding a ppmv limit for 
controlling non-gasoline VOC and HAP emissions and whether 
carbon adsorption would be used to control emissions from 
crude oil and other commodities.

I. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting 
Requirements 


For enforcement purposes, it is necessary to require 
records and reports of various parameters at all facilities. 
Two types of records would be required to ensure compliance 
of facilities required to install controls: (1) Monitoring 
results from the most recent performance test and 
(2) results from periods when the measurement of parameters 
significantly deviated from measurements of the same 
parameters during the most recent performance test. Reports 
of those periods when monitored parameters were 
significantly outside the specified range would be submitted 
quarterly. These reports are necessary to ensure that the 
control equipment is maintained in good operating condition. 
Additionally, owners or operators would be required to 
keep vapor tightness documentation for marine vessels loaded 
on file in a permanent form available for inspection. The 
owner or operator would be required to update the vapor 
tightness documentation at least once per year to ensure 
that only vapor tight marine vessels are loaded. 
Owners or operators of affected facilities seeking to 
demonstrate compliance with the 93 percent emission 
reduction standard must maintain records of their 
determination of HAP control efficiency and must submit 
quarterly reports of the source's HAP control efficiency 
calculated from their actual throughputs. The Agency is 
soliciting comment on these requirements. Specifically, the 
Agency requests information on the type and method of 
documentation that should be required to assure compliance 
with the 93 percent emission reduction standard. 


J. Solicitation of Comments 


The Administrator specifically requests comments on the 
topics discussed in this section. Commenters should provide 
available data and rationale to support their comments on 
each topic. 


1. Subcategories 


The Agency has proposed to establish a subcategory for 
terminals emitting less than 1 Mg/yr of HAP. The Agency is 
also requesting comment on whether off-shore terminals and 
the Valdez Marine Terminal should be placed in separate 
subcategories under section 112 of the Act. The Agency 
requests comment regarding whether subcategories should be 
established for other types of terminals based on particular 
characteristics of these types of terminals of which the 
Agency currently has no information. EPA also requests 
comments on whether further subcategorization based on size 
is warranted. 
a. 

Offshore terminals. 

The Agency does not believe 
that a facility which is at least one-half mile offshore is 
part of a land-based contiguous site. Offshore terminals 
(both those with subsea lines and platforms) that are part 
of a contiguous terminal (i.e., offshore terminals less than 
1/2 mile from shore) present unique regulatory challenges 
such as the cost and environmental impacts of installing 
additional subsea lines to carry vapors to land-based 
equipment. Size constraints, permitting difficulties, and 
other concerns may be issues with an offshore control 
system. The EPA is proposing that offshore terminals exceeding the throughput cutoffs and emission limits be 
subject to the proposed regulations and control vapors to 
the same extent as onshore facilities. The EPA is 
soliciting information and comments regarding the 
feasibility and cost of controlling emissions from offshore 
terminals. Comments are also requested on the grouping of 
offshore facilities into a separate subcategory with 
different control requirements under MACT. 
b. 

Additional subcategory for the valdez marine 
terminal. 

On December 29, 1993, the Alyeska Pipeline 
Service Company (``Alyeska'') sent a letter to the Agency 
regarding this proposed rule (see Docket A-90-44, item II-D- 
65). In the letter, Alyeska discussed an alternative 
regulatory approach that would allow the use of less 
stringent controls at Alyeska's Alaska Valdez Marine 
Terminal (VMT). Alyeska ``believes that the optimal vapor 
emission control system for the VMT is a system that 
captures and recovers vapors from tanker loading, rather 
than one that incinerates captured vapors.'' Alyeska 
believes that it can successfully design a vapor recovery 
system for the VMT but intuitively believes that the 
emission reduction that such a system can achieve will be 
less than the percentage emissions reduction achieved by 
significantly smaller systems and particularly those which 
address emissions from refined petroleum products rather 
than crude oil. Alyeska also believes that a vapor recovery 
system for the VMT is unlikely to meet today's proposed 
requirements of a 95-percent emission reduction of VOC and 
HAP for recovery devices under section 183(f) and section 
112, respectively. In addition, Alyeska states that the VMT 
should be placed in a separate category or subcategory under 
section 112(d) because Alyeska believes the VMT is unique 
among U.S. marine terminals. 
Alyeska has also suggested separately (see Docket A-90- 
44, item II-D-71) that a recovery device may be available to 
VMT that could meet a HAP emission reduction requirement 
approaching 93 percent but that would likely not meet a VOC 
reduction requirement above 70 percent. Alyeska suggests 
that as it is located in an ozone attainment area in an 
extreme northern climate where formation of ozone is not a 
practical concern, a lesser VOC reduction requirement may be 
reasonable under section 183(f). The proposed format for 
the Section 112 emission limit requires the VMT to reduce 
all the crude emissions by 95 percent when using a recovery 
device. The EPA requests comments on whether this format 
could be changed to allow for a 93-percent reduction of 
emissions for less efficient control technologies. 
The EPA made no changes to the proposed standard in 
response to Alyeska's letter. However, the EPA is seeking 
public comment on the issues addressed by Alyeska. In 
addition, Alyeska intends to provide the EPA with further 
documentation supporting its position before the end of the 
public comment period. The EPA will consider this new 
information in addition to currently available information 
in deciding the final standard. Currently available 
information which will be considered is described in the 
following paragraphs.

<TEXT>
 

Section 183(f) requires the application of RACT 
considering ``costs, any non-air quality benefits, 
environmental impacts, energy requirements and safety 
factors associated with alternative control techniques.'' 
Section 112(d) requires the application of MACT considering 
the ``cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy

requirements.'' (In addition, as described previously, a 
minimum control level is specified, referred to as the 
floor.) 

Section 112(c) requires the EPA to establish categories 
and subcategories of sources for regulation under section 
112(d). In the EPA's notice of initial list of categories, 
the EPA stated that ``a category of sources is a group of 
sources having some common features suggesting that they 
should be regulated in the same way and on the same 
schedule.'' (57 FR 31578, July 16, 1992). The EPA also 
noted that ``criteria that may need to be considered in 
defining categories of similar sources include similarities 
in: process operations (including differences between batch 
and continuous operations), emissions characteristics, 
control device applicability and costs, safety and 
opportunities for pollution prevention'' (57 FR 31580). To 
justify VMT being placed in a separate category or 
subcategory, it needs to be shown that VMT has distinctions 
that are relevant from a regulatory standpoint (given the 
restrictions of section 112), in determining whether the VMT 
can be regulated in a similar manner as other terminals. 

The VMT is the largest crude oil loading facility in 
the U.S. with hourly crude loading rates more than 15 times 
that of any other marine terminal. The VMT is one of only a 
few terminals which are exclusively used for crude oil 
loading. 

Alyeska has acknowledged that it could use a combustion 
device at VMT to achieve a 98 percent reduction in 
emissions. However, Alyeska has raised concerns about the 
feasibility of recovering crude oil vapors with a 95 percent 
efficiency using conventional recovery devices such as 
carbon adsorbers. 
According to Alyeska the design and construction of a 
vapor recovery system for the VMT would be technically more 
complicated than for any other marine terminal. This is 
because no existing vapor recovery system is currently 
operating on as large a vapor stream as the VMT terminal, 
there is great complexity in recovering crude oil vapor (as 
opposed to petroleum product vapor), and for reasons 
discussed in the following paragraph, a VMT recovery system 
would have to be designed to operate efficiently over a 
broad range of declining input volumes. In addition, the 
sub-Arctic climate of the region presents unique problems 
with regard to handling water vapor in terms of both 
complications on the technical processes by which crude oil 
vapors can be recovered and in terms of monitoring accuracy. 
Different and more complex operating parameters must be 
considered in the design and construction of a vapor 
recovery system that will operate effectively on the VMT 
crude oil stream because the number and range of volatility 
of the hydrocarbon components are greater in a crude oil 
stream than in a product stream. Alyeska believes that it 
may not be possible to achieve as high a recovery from a 
crude oil vapor stream as is achievable from a product vapor 
stream because of this difference in the number and range of 
volatility of the hydrocarbon components. 
The throughput in the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline (TAP), 
which supplies the crude for loading at the VMT, is expected 
to decline such that the volume of vapors that must be 
handled by the VMT recovery system will decrease with time. 
In 1988 annual TAP throughput reached a peak of 2.14 million 
barrels per day. Throughput subsequently has declined to a 
current level of 1.62 million barrels per day (average year 
to date for 1993) and estimates indicate that production 
will continue to decline over the life of the now declining 
North Slope oil fields. An emission control system designed 
for the VMT needs to be able to operate efficiently over a 
broad range of declining input volumes. When considering 
declining throughput, a recovery system enables more design 
flexibility than an incineration system because recovery 
systems require enough contact with either surface area or 
scrubbing liquid to ensure high recovery; as flow decreases 
contact increases which marginally increases recovery. 
Therefore, a facility may design very large control units or 
smaller parallel units, both of which will function at 
design efficiency. An incinerator is not as flexible in 
operation as a recovery system. An incinerator requires 
proper mixing of the waste stream and the flame and mixing 
becomes poorer as flow rates decline. Large incinerators 
cannot be run at flow rates much lower than one half design 
rates without affecting mixing and corresponding combustion 
efficiency. 

In addition the VMT will require the use of ``active'' 
detonation arrestors instead of ``passive'' detonation 
arrestors used at other marine terminals, due to the amount 
of vapors that must be collected and the distance between 
the vessel loading berths and vapor recovery facilities. 
Alyeska has developed active detonator arrestors that have 
been approved by the Coast Guard, because passive detonation 
arrestors would not protect a VMT type system from 
explosion.

Alyeska estimated that the additional amount of energy 
that could be conserved by recovering (instead of 
incinerating) tanker vapors at the VMT would be as great or 
greater than the energy that could be saved by recovering 
tanker vapors at all other U.S. crude oil loading marine 
terminals combined (about 250,000 barrels at current 
throughput). Both recovery and incineration result in other 
air pollutants including particulate matter (PM), sulfur 
oxides (SO

X

), nitrogen oxides (NO

X

), carbon monoxide (CO), 
and carbon dioxide (CO

2

). Vapor recovery may be more 
advantageous when considering the overall contribution of 
all pollutants to the environment.
 
The proposed standard does not treat a facility such as 
the VMT as a separate category or subcategory. However, the 
EPA is still considering whether these characteristics 
described above are sufficient to warrant treatment of a 
facility like the VMT as a separate subcategory, and is 
requesting additional information and public comments on 
this issue. Comment is also requested on the extent to 
which these factors, largely related to recovery devices, 
should be considered if such a facility can use an 
incinerator. Additional information is sought on the extent 
to which factors such as a different detonator device are 
relevant to the decision. The EPA also invites comment on 
Alyeska's suggestion that a VOC reduction requirement less 
stringent than 95 percent is appropriate for a terminal in 
an ozone attainment area in an extreme northern climate 
where ozone formation is not a practical concern. The EPA 
will evaluate all information and comments submitted in 
making a final determination before promulgation of the 
standard. 

Alyeska states that diminishing throughput could 
eliminate the need for control equipment at all berths in 
the future; if throughput continues to decline, the VMT will 
eventually be able to handle the entire throughput at only 
two berths instead of the four available berths. Alyeska 
has raised an issue concerning the need to control the 
berths normally not in use if they are used for ``emergency 
purposes.'' The issue is independent of the choice of 
control systems and would not be considered in a 
determination of whether it is appropriate to put the VMT in 
a separate subcategory. However, the EPA may evaluate a 
regulatory approach which requires full control of emissions 
at the primary loading berths, but allows occasional use of 
uncontrolled berths. This type of regulatory scenario 
assumes that emissions from the uncontrolled berths would be 
negligible when compared to emissions to the controlled 
berths. For the EPA to evaluate such an approach requires 
VMT to provide detailed information on the impacts and 
tradeoffs for various scenarios of the controlled versus 
uncontrolled berths. The EPA is requesting comments on this 
type of approach, including the need to limit frequency of 
use or mass emissions, and the details that should be in the 
rule to ensure compliance. 

If facilities with characteristics like the VMT were in 
a separate subcategory, the MACT floor would appear to be no 
control. The EPA would consider requiring control levels 
more stringent than the MACT floor. The tradeoffs between 
incineration and vapor recovery would be considered in this 
determination, and also in the determination of RACT under 
section 183(f). The declining throughput and its affect on 
the number of berths would also be considered in this 
decision. 

Alyeska is still studying the total impacts associated 
with vapor recovery systems. Currently, Alyeska has not yet 
provided the EPA with the control efficiency of the recovery 
process, the energy requirements, costs, or the secondary 
pollutants associated with recovery; nor has Alyeska 
provided evidence showing that a 93 or 95 percent reduction 
in emissions of HAP using a recovery device is infeasible at 
VMT. Moreover, given that the EPA's definition of VOC does 
not include methane and ethane, there is some question as to 
whether a 95 percent reduction in VOC is in fact possible 
using recovery at the VMT. Additional information is also 
needed on the declining throughput, its effect on the number 
of berths controlled, and the tradeoffs involved. The EPA 
could possibly consider the trade-offs among HAP, VOC, PM, 
SO

X

, NO

X

, CO and CO

2

 in addition to energy savings when 
evaluating recovery versus incineration. The EPA invites 
comment on whether a regulatory approach that would allow 
the use of a less stringent vapor recovery system at the VMT 
is permissible and appropriate under the Act. Such comments 
should include the consideration of tradeoffs between HAP, 
other pollutants, energy, and whether consideration of such 
tradeoffs is permissible under sections 112 and 183(f). 
Before promulgating a final rule, the EPA will evaluate all 
additional information, data, and comments submitted. Based 
on this evaluation, the promulgated standards could be set 
at the proposed RACT and MACT levels, but the EPA will 
examine all information relevant to including a separate 
subcategory for large crude terminals and establishing a 
different MACT level for each subcategory.

2. Ballasting Emissions 


In preparing today's proposed rule the Agency has assumed that the prohibition of ballasting emissions does not contain
any impacts for industry because of the U.S. Coast Guard regulations requiring segregated ballasting tanks. The
Administrator is soliciting comments and data that might indicate that there are potential impacts to certain classes
of vessels, particularly those carrying noncrude oil product. In addition, the Administrator encourages comment
on how a prohibition of ballasting emissions could be implemented most effectively. 


3. Alternative Concentration-Based Compliance Determination 


For terminals that use recovery devices for control of gasoline VOC and/or HAP emissions, the EPA is proposing an alternative
means of compliance to the proposed standards. The EPA is soliciting data and comments regarding a ppmv limit for controlling
non-gasoline VOC and HAP emissions and whether carbon adsorption would be used to control emissions from crude oil
and other commodities. 


4. Vessel Tightness Testing 


The proposed standards require vessels to undergo one of three tightness tests at least every 12 months. The Administrator
is soliciting data on the frequency of leaks on marine vessels to determine whether the interval between tests is appropriate.
The Administrator is also requesting data on the effectiveness of requiring vessels to undergo one of these three
tightness tests. 


5. Procedures to Estimate HAP Emissions 


The TSD describes the limited data regarding marine vessel loading emission factors available to the Administrator
to use in estimating HAP (or VOC) emissions from marine vessel loading operations. While these data are sufficient
to estimate emissions as part of regulatory impact analyses, they may not be sufficient for the Administrator to require
the use of specific emission factors in the emission estimation alternative allowed under the proposed part 63 standards
for existing sources. For this reason, facilities wanting to take advantage of this alternative will develop and
submit documentation of emission estimates on a case-by-case basis. The Administrator requests that commenters
submit data on possible emission factors and/or alternative emission estimation procedures for consideration
in the final rule. 


6. RACT Standard of 93 Percent Reduction 


As discussed above, for those sources regulated under section 183(f) of the Act, the EPA is requiring that such sources
reduce emissions at their facility overall by 95 percent if using a recovery device or by 98 percent if using a destruction
device. Nevertheless, the Agency specifically decided not to increase the stringency of its MACT standard, for those
existing sources regulated under section 112, beyond a reduction level of 93 percent because the cost effectiveness
level of such an increase would not be reasonable. 
The Agency believes that it is reasonable, given the associated cost effectiveness values, to require the facilities
regulated under section 183(f) (the largest terminals of their kind in the U.S.) to reduce emissions by 95 or 98 percent,
despite the fact that the Agency is requiring only 93 percent reduction for the terminals regulated under section
112. However, the EPA understands that it is unusual for a RACT standard for any single source to be more stringent than
a MACT standard for that source, as it may be for certain sources regulated under both sections 112 and 183(f). 
The Agency requests comment on whether the analysis performed for regulation of sources under the MACT standard of
section 112 is equally valid under the RACT standard of section 183(f). That is, given the cost effectiveness values
associated with decreasing the stringency of the RACT standard from 95 or 98 percent control to 93 percent control,
would it be reasonable, ``considering costs, any nonair-quality benefits, environmental impacts, energy requirements
and safety factors,'' for the Agency to promulgate a standard of 93 percent control for those sources regulated under
section 183(f), in addition to those sources regulated solely under section 112? 


7. Carbon Bed Regeneration Emissions 


In the proposed regulation, the Agency is prohibiting HAP emissions from the regeneration of a carbon bed when a carbon
bed adsorber is used to control HAP emissions. The Agency is requesting comment on this requirement.

Specifically, the Agency requests comment on the degree to which steam stripping (in which steam is used to regenerate
these carbon beds) is used at affected sources. 


8. MACT Floor Determination 


In a March 9, 1994, 

Federal Register

 notice reopening the public comment period for determination of ``MACT floor'' for NESHAP source categories (59
FR 11018), the Agency considered more than one interpretation of the statutory language concerning the MACT floor
for existing sources and solicited comment on them. The MACT floor decision that the EPA will make on the basis of this
March 9, 1994, notice will have broad precedential effects, and will presumptively be followed by the Agency in any
rulemakings subsequently promulgated under Title III of the Act. The MACT floor determinations proposed in today's
rulemaking may therefore be affected by the Agency's final interpretation of ``MACT floor.'' 
Sections 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act require that the EPA set standards no less stringent than ``the average emission
limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources'' if there are at least 30 sources in
a category, or ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources'' if there are fewer than
30 sources in a category. During the development of this proposed rule, the EPA considered two interpretations of
this statutory language. One interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation achieved by'' together
in a single phrase and asks what is the ``average emission limitation achieved by'' the best performing 12 percent.
This interpretation places the emphasis on ``average.'' It would correspond to first identifying the best performing
12 percent of the existing sources, then determining the average emission limitation achieved by these sources as
a group. Another interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase and asks what
``average emission limitation'' is ``achieved by'' all members of the best performing 12 percent. In this case, the
``average emission limitation'' might be interpreted as the average reduction across the HAP emitted by an emission
point over time. Under this interpretation, the EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each of the
best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This interpretation would correspond to the
level of control achieved by the source at the 88th percentile if all sources were ranked from the most controlled (100th
percentile) to the least controlled (1st percentile). For today's proposed regulation, the Administrator is using
the first interpretation described above, which interprets the statutory language to mean that the MACT floor for
existing sources should be set at the level of control achieved by the ``average'' of the best performing 12 percent.

In establishing the MACT floor for today's proposed regulations, the EPA also considered two possible meanings for
the word ``average'' as the term is used in section 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act. First, the EPA considered interpreting
``average'' as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided
by the number of measurements in the set. The EPA determined that the arithmetic mean of the emissions limitations
achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources in some cases would yield an emission limitation that
fails to correspond to the limitation achieved by any particular technology. In cases where this limitation existed,
the EPA decided not to select this approach. The EPA also considered interpreting ``average'' as the median emission
limitation value. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of
values (when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude). 
For the subcategory of sources emitting 1 Mg/yr or more of HAP, the Agency determined that the derived arithmetic mean,
for all practical purposes, is equivalent to recovery technologies and thus the Agency used the mean to determine
the MACT floor for this subcategory. The EPA selected the median for the subcategory of sources emitting less than
1 Mg/yr of HAP because the arithmetic mean yields a value that does not correspond to a particular emission control
technology. 
The EPA solicits comment on its interpretation of ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing
12 percent of the existing sources'' (section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act) and its methodology for determining the MACT
floor.

The proposed standard requires that terminals using a 
combustion device to comply with the standard monitor the 
combustion temperature computed every hour as an hourly 
average, and every third hour as a 3-hour block average. 
Operation of the affected source in deviation of the 
baseline temperature developed during the compliance test in 
excess of 5.6
 C (10
 F) constitutes noncompliance with the 
standard. The baseline temperature is averaged over the 
loading cycle. The Agency believes that it is appropriate 
to average temperatures measured during the compliance test 
to establish a baseline temperature to which monitored data 
can be compared. The Agency is soliciting comments on the 
effect of the proposed averaging times on the parameter's 
effectiveness in ensuring compliance with the proposed 
standards. 




IV. Administrative Requirements 




A. Public Hearing 




The EPA will hold a public hearing to discuss the 
proposed standard in accordance with section 307(d)(5) of 
the amended Act. Persons wishing to make oral presentation 
on the proposed standards for marine tank vessel loading 
operations should contact the EPA at the address given in 
the 

ADDRESSES 

section of this preamble. The EPA will limit 
oral presentations to 15 minutes each. Any member of the 
public may file a written statement before, during, or 
within 30 days after the hearing. Send written statements 
to the Air Docket Section address given in the 

ADDRESSES 


section of this preamble and should refer to Docket A-90-44. 


The EPA will make a verbatim transcript of the hearing 
and written statements available for public inspection and 
copying during normal working hours at the EPA's Air Docket 
Section in Washington, DC (see 

ADDRESSES 

section of this 
preamble). 




B. Docket 




The docket is an organized and complete file of all of 
the information submitted to or otherwise considered by the 
EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The 
principal purposes of the docket are (1) to allow interested 
parties to readily identify and locate documents so that 
they can intelligently and effectively participate in the 
rulemaking process and (2) to serve as the record in case of 
judicial review (except for interagency review materials) 
(section 307(d)(7)(A) of the amended Act). 




C. Office of Management and Budget Reviews 



1. Paperwork Reduction Act 




The information collection requirements in this 
proposed standard have been submitted for approval to the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information 
Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the 
EPA (ICR No. 1679.01), and interested parties may obtain a 
copy from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 
401 M Street, SW. (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by 
calling (202) 260-2740. The public reporting burden for 
this collection of information is estimated to average 
265 hours per respondent per year, including time for 
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, 
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing 
and reviewing the collection of information. 


Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information 
Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, and to the Office 
of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management 
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk 
Officer for the EPA.'' The final standard will respond to 
any OMB or public comments on the information collection 
requirements contained in this proposal. 




2. Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 Review 




Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review 
and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order 
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is 
likely to result in a rule that may: 


(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way 
the economy, a section of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 


(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940513-1-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940513-1-00017 </PARENT>

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 



(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has 
been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory 
action'' because an annual effect on the economy of 
$100 million or more is anticipated. As such, this action 
was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response 
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in 
the public record. 





D. Regulatory Flexibility Act Compliance 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 
September 19, 1980) requires consideration of the impacts of 
regulations on small entities, which are small businesses, 
small organizations, and small governments. The major 
purpose of this Act is to ensure consideration of regulatory 
alternatives that might mitigate adverse economic impacts on 
small entities. If a preliminary analysis indicates that a 
proposed regulation is likely to have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities, a 
regulatory flexibility analysis must be performed to examine 
alternatives that might lessen such effects. 



The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the 
MACT determination considered for this regulation, which 
included a preliminary assessment of the potential adverse 
impacts on small entities. Two types of businesses were 
identified that could incur adverse small business impacts: 
marine terminal operations and marine vessel operations. 



With regard to marine terminal operations, the proposed 
standards exempt facilities with HAP emissions of less than 
1 Mg/yr. This reduces the number of impacted terminals from 
approximately 1,450 to 264. These exemptions allow the 
smallest operations to avoid installation of controls. 
These exemptions greatly reduce per-barrel control cost 
differentials that, as indicated in the economic impact 
analysis, would make it difficult for owners of the smallest 
terminals to pass forward control costs to consumers had no 
or fewer exemptions been made. With the proposed standards, 
however, it is expected that a large portion (up to 200) of 
the 264 regulated terminals will only be able to pass a 
fraction of the control costs on to consumers in the form of 
higher prices. This condition is attributable to the EPA's 
assumption that loading costs will increase by the average 
cost of control, that terminals are competitive and that 
higher than average control cost terminals will have to 
absorb those differences. Thus, the economic impact on 
these terminal owners is expected to be significant because 
of the impact of cost absorption on profitability and/or 
difficulty in raising capital for the control system. On 
the other hand, of those 200 terminals, it is expected that 
many are part of large integrated petroleum operations, have 
easier access to capital and will remain open. Some with 
higher than average control costs will also be in a position 
to raise their prices as much as their control costs because 
of favorable locations or other market conditions. However, 
the overall number of small business terminal operations 
significantly affected by this regulation is expected to be 
substantial. 



With regard to marine vessel operations, the economic 
impact analysis considered all of these operations to be 
small businesses. The number of vessel operations estimated 
to be impacted by the proposed standards is expected to be 
substantial since a significant percentage of the petroleum 
products transported via marine vessels will be affected by 
the standards. Excluding volume from the three large crude 
oil terminals affected (these terminals are served by large 
oil tankers with insignificant estimated retrofit costs 
($0.002/bbl), 77 percent of the U.S. marine transported 
throughput of controlled products and crude oil will be 
affected by the standards. That same volume percentage of 
the fleet marine vessels will need to be retrofitted to 
service regulated terminals. It is expected, however, that 
many of these vessel owners will be able to pass forward 
retrofit costs in the form of higher transport prices. 



The Agency has therefore judged that a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
(namely terminals) will likely result from the proposed 
standards and that a regulatory flexibility analysis should 
be performed.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Public Hearing and Reopening of Comment Period for Proposal
to List the Lake Erie Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon insularum) as a Threatened Species



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that two public hearings will be held on the proposed determination
of threatened status for the Lake Erie water snake (

Nerodia sipedon insularum

) and that the comment period on the proposal is reopened. The hearings and reopened comment period will allow comments
on this proposal to be submitted from all interested parties.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



The Lake Erie water snake is found on the islands of western Lake Erie and the adjacent mainland of Ohio and Ontario,
Canada. It has been proposed for listing as a threatened species due to strong evidence that its numbers have declined
dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat and human persecution, and that the threats
to the habitat and to the snakes themselves are continuing.

The 

Federal Register

 notice announcing the proposing of the Lake Erie water snake for classification as a threatened species was published
on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43857). The original comment period ended on November 16, and the deadline for receipt of public
hearing requests was October 4. On October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52740), a second notice was published extending the comment
period until November 16, 1993.

On October 5, 1993, the Service received a request for a public hearing on this proposal from Donald J. McTigue, representing
Baycliff's Corporation. A second request for a public hearing was received by the Service on October 13, 1993, from
H. R. Clagg, President of the Johnson's Island Property Owners' Association. The Service has scheduled two hearings
in the area potentially affected by the listing proposal. Those parties wishing to make statements for the record
should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the hearing. Oral statements may
be limited to 5 or 10 minutes, if the number of parties present necessitates some limitation. There are no limits to
the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. Oral and written comments receive
equal consideration.

In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may now
be submitted until June 16, 1994, to the Service office in the 

ADDRESSES

 section or at the public hearing.

ACTION:

 Proposed rule and subsistence harvest estimates for the Pribilof Islands. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is required to publish an estimate of the number of seals expected to be harvested in the current year to meet the
subsistence needs of the Aleut residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK, pursuant to the regulations governing the subsistence
taking of northern fur seals. The purpose of these regulations is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing
for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict taking by sex, age, and season for herd management
purposes. This notice estimates the number of seals to be taken in 1994. This notice also proposes to amend existing
fur seal regulations, making the harvest take estimates applicable for 3 years instead of 1 year. This proposed amendment
is based on the fact that a relatively consistent number of fur seals has been harvested each year since 1989, and that
NMFS does not expect subsistence needs to increase such that takes for subsistence purposes will exceed the established
upper limit of the subsistence harvest estimate range first established for the 1992 harvest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The subsistence harvest of northern fur seals, 

Callorhinus ursinus

, on the Pribilof Islands, AK, is governed by regulations found in 50 CFR part 215, subpart D_Taking for Subsistence
Purposes. The purpose of these regulations, published under the authority of the Fur Seal Act (FSA), 16 U.S.C. 1151


et seq

., and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq

., is to limit the take of fur seals to a level providing for the subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents and to restrict
taking by sex, age, and season for herd management purposes. To minimize negative effects on the Pribilof Islands
fur seal population, the harvest has been limited to a 47-day season (June 23-August 8) and is restricted to only
subadult male fur seals. 

Pursuant to the regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes, NMFS must publish a summary
of the previous year's fur seal harvest (1993 harvest results were published on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 59297)), and
a projection of the number of seals expected to be taken in the current year to meet the subsistence needs of the Aleut
residents of the Pribilof Islands, AK. 

The projected estimates are given as a range, the lower end of which may be exceeded if NMFS is given notice, and the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), determines that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof Aleuts have
not been satisfied (50 CFR 215.32(e)(3)). Conversely, the harvest can be terminated before the lower end of the range
is reached if it is determined that the annual subsistence needs of the Pribilof residents have been met or the harvest
has been conducted in a wasteful manner. 



Subsistence Estimates and Trends 



The number of northern fur seals harvested on St. Paul Island since 1986 has ranged from 1,077 (1990) to 1,710 (1987)
(Table 1). The annual subsistence takes on St. George Island since 1986 have ranged from 92 (1987) to 319 (1993) seals
(Table 1). Within the past 3 years, however, the number of fur seals harvested annually has been relatively consistent.
Since 1991, the average number of seals harvested each year on St. Paul and St. George Islands has been 1,548 (range:
1,482-1,645) and 265 (range: 194-319), respectively (Table 1). Furthermore, the actual number of animals
harvested has never reached the upper end of the estimated range. In 1992, for example, only 194 of the 365 fur seals
originally estimated for subsistence need during that year were taken on St. George Island. In 1993, only 319 of the
407 seals requested were taken to meet the subsistence needs of St. George residents.

Estimate of Subsistence Need for 1994 



NMFS has used the previous year's harvest levels as a baseline to estimate need in the current year. Household surveys
have also been conducted by the tribal government on each island since 1992 to estimate, in part, the number of seals
required to meet the subsistence needs of the Pribilof Islands residents (57 FR 22450, May 25, 1992, and 58 FR 32892,
June 14, 1993). However, not all households can be assessed during a survey. Therefore, results of these surveys provide
an index of need rather than an absolute estimate. 

NMFS requested that the tribal government on each island determine the number of fur seals that each household would
need for the coming year on January 13, 1994. This year's results were consistent with past subsistence harvest survey
requests and take records. Therefore, NMFS proposes that the same estimate ranges be established for 1994 as were
established for 1992 and 1993: 281-500 fur seals for St. George Island and 1,645 to 2,000 for St. Paul Island.
NMFS' biologists will continue to monitor the entire harvest on St. George and St. Paul Islands to ensure that the harvest
is carried out in a manner that fully complies with the regulations specified at 50 CFR 215.32. 

As described earlier in this notice, if the Aleut residents of either island reach the lower end of this yearly harvest
estimate and have unmet subsistence needs and no indication of waste, they may request an additional number of seals
up to the upper limit of the respective harvest estimates. The residents of St. George Island and St. Paul Island may
substantiate any additional need for seals by submitting in writing the information upon which they base their decision
that subsistence needs are unfulfilled. The regulations at 50 CFR 215.32(e)(1)(iii) require a suspension of the
fur seal harvest for up to 48 hours once the lower end of the estimated harvest levels is reached. The suspension is to
last no more than 48 hours, followed either by a finding that the subsistence needs have been met or by a revised estimate
of the number of seals necessary to satisfy the Aleuts' subsistence needs. 



Proposed Modification to Fur Seal Regulations 



In a notice published on August 1, 1991, NMFS acknowledged the need to develop other methods to monitor the subsistence
harvest conducted on the Pribilof Islands (56 FR 36735). In a workshop conducted by NMFS on November 5, 1991, NMFS recognized
the need to reevaluate the regulatory issues regarding subsistence, to determine whether changes in the fur seal
harvest from a commercial endeavor to one for subsistence may have warranted a revision of the current management
regime. 

As a first step towards addressing these concerns, NMFS proposes an amendment to  215.32 of the FSA regulations,
allowing subsistence take estimates to be applicable for a 3-year period, beginning in 1994. During this 3-year period,
NMFS will examine the current subsistence harvest management regime. The proposed amendment is based on the fact
that the actual number of fur seals harvested each year since 1989 has been relatively consistent (Table 1), and the
fur seal take has never exceeded the upper limit of the estimated range for subsistence need within any year of the harvest.
Due to recent commercial development in the Pribilof Islands, NMFS anticipates that the subsistence needs will increase
during the next 3 years, but, based on historical evidence to date, the annual subsistence needs are not expected to
increase to levels exceeding the range established in the 1993 final estimate. 



Classification 



NMFS has determined that the approval and implementation of this proposed rule will not significantly affect the
human environment, and that preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on this is not required by section 102(2)
of the National Environmental Policy Act or its implementing regulations. This rule makes only minor changes to the
regulations governing the taking of fur seals for subsistence purposes; this action does not entail significant
substantive revision. Because this rule does not alter the conclusions of previous environmental impact analyses
and environmental assessments, it is categorically excluded by NOAA Administrative Order 216-6 from the requirement
to prepare an environmental assessment. 

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant pursuant to E.O. 12866.

The General Counsel, Department of Commerce, certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
The only impact will be on individual native Alaskan residents of the Pribilof Islands due to revision of the schedule
for estimating fur seal harvest levels from an annual estimate to an estimate applicable to a 3-year period. Therefore,
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.

Northeast Multispecies Fishery

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement a revised part of Amendment 5 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) for the winter flounder fishery (revised winter flounder exemption) that was initially disapproved on
September 30, 1993. The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) has revised a provision that would exempt
fishermen from some regulations for the winter flounder fishery, under certain conditions, if they are fishing only
in state waters. The intended effect is to ensure adequate protection for winter flounder stocks, while minimizing
the regulatory burden on fishermen.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The Council submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP on 
September 27, 1993. Two measures in the amendment were disapproved on September 30, 1993_a haddock possession limit,
and the provisions for winter flounder fishing in state waters. The remainder of Amendment 5 was approved on January
3, 1994. Pursuant to section 304(b)(3)(A) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act),
the Council has submitted the revised winter flounder exemption as described in this proposed rule. The Council's
submission of a revised haddock possession limit is not contained in this action. 
The disapproved measure for winter flounder established an exemption to the minimum mesh size and minimum fish size
regulations when fishing for winter flounder in state waters, provided that a given state's regulations conformed
with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's (ASMFC) Winter Flounder Plan (ASMFC Plan). The original
submission for winter flounder was disapproved because this provision was added to Amendment 5 without adequate
analysis, was poorly defined, and would likely have increased mortality of winter flounder and other multispecies.

The revised winter flounder exemption, as described in this proposed rule, lists a detailed set of criteria under
which a vessel holding a Federal Northeast multispecies permit may fish for winter flounder with mesh smaller than
the minimum mesh requirement in the FMP, and retain winter flounder smaller than the minimum fish size for that species
in the FMP. 
Currently, Federal regulations for winter flounder apply to all federally permitted vessels whether they are fishing
in state waters or Federal waters. When a federally permitted vessel is fishing for winter flounder in state waters,
the more restrictive of either the state or Federal regulations applies. Thus, even if an overall state management
program is more restrictive, an individual Federal regulation, such as a minimum mesh size, applies if it is more restrictive
than the individual state regulation.

The regulations implementing Amendment 5 to the FMP 
(59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994), increased the minimum mesh size for fishing for any of the regulated multispecies finfish,
including winter flounder, and applied it throughout the range of the species. Prior to Amendment 5, the minimum mesh
size was 51/2 inches (13.97 cm) in the Gulf of Maine, on Georges Bank, and a part of Southern New England, while elsewhere
there was no minimum net mesh size. Under Amendment 5, the minimum mesh size requirement is 6 inches (15.24 cm) throughout
the net in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank, as of May 1, 1994. The minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97
cm) throughout the net in Southern New England in 1994, remaining 
51/2 inch (13.97 cm) diamond and increasing to 6-inch 
(15.24 cm) square in 1995, and thereafter. In the mid-Atlantic, the minimum mesh size requirement is 51/2 inches (13.97
cm) as described in the summer flounder regulations under 50 CFR 625.24(a). Also under the amendment, the minimum
size for winter flounder was increased from 11 inches (27.9 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm). 
The ASMFC Plan was approved in May, 1992. The fishing mortality objectives of the ASMFC Plan, a maximum spawning potential
(MSP) target of 30 percent by January 1, 1995, and an MSP target of 40 percent by January 1, 1999, are more restrictive
than in the FMP for federally managed stocks (20 percent MSP). The ASMFC Plan allows individual states to utilize different
measures to achieve these objectives. State plans must be reviewed by the ASMFC's Winter Flounder Technical Committee
and approved by the ASMFC Winter Flounder Management Board as meeting the management objectives. 
The Council proposes the winter flounder exemption on the basis that, while the management objectives of the ASMFC
Plan are more conservative for winter flounder than those of Amendment 5, they may be achieved by a different set of
measures than those in the FMP. Without the proposed exemption, a vessel would have to comply with the more restrictive
elements of both the state and Federal regulations. Under these circumstances, compliance with both state and Federal
rules simultaneously might impose an unnecessary regulatory burden on federally permitted vessels fishing in state
waters for winter flounder that exceeds that which applies to either state-permitted vessels fishing exclusively
in state waters or federally permitted vessels fishing in Federal waters. The purpose of the proposed action is to
alleviate the cumulative impact of the regulations on fishermen, while still achieving the FMP's objectives for
winter flounder and other regulated species of the FMP. 
The proposed rule provides that a vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit may fish for winter flounder with mesh
smaller than that specified in the regulations governing the multispecies fishery (50 CFR part 651), may retain winter
flounder smaller than the minimum size allowed by those regulations, and may retain more than the possession limit
of winter flounder, if certain conditions are met. These conditions are: (1) The fishing is conducted exclusively
in the waters of the state from which the exemption certificate was obtained; 
(2) the vessel has on board a certificate issued by the state agency authorizing the vessel's participation in the
state's winter flounder fishing program and is in compliance with the applicable state laws pertaining to minimum
mesh size and minimum fish size for winter flounder; (3) the state's winter flounder plan has been approved by the ASMFC
as being in compliance with the ASMFC Plan; (4) the state elects in writing to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS
(Regional Director), to participate in the exemption program; (5) the amount of regulated species, exclusive of
winter flounder, on board a vessel issued a limited access permit that is fishing under the days-at-sea (DAS) program
or under a DAS exemption program in  651.22(d), does not exceed the possession limit; (6) the vessel does not
enter or transit the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), unless the vessel is in a designated transit zone established
by the Regional Director at the request of the coastal state; and (7) the vessel does not enter or transit the waters
of another state, unless such other state is participating in the exemption program described by this section and
the vessel is enrolled in that state's program. 
The exemption to Federal fishery regulations being proposed in this action would apply to minimum fish lengths, minimum
mesh size, and the regulated species possession limit of winter flounder, in certain cases. A vessel must still comply
with all other applicable Federal fisheries regulations while fishing for winter flounder under this exemption.

The intent of this revised version of the winter flounder exemption is to achieve conservation objectives under the
FMP and the ASMFC Plan for winter flounder, and to meet conservation objectives under the FMP for other regulated species
of groundfish as defined in the FMP, while still providing for the winter flounder exemption in state waters. The Council
intends that any vessel holding a Federal multispecies permit under the FMP subject to requirements of the DAS program
in the FMP will have its fishing activity in state waters for winter flounder credited towards its individual DAS or
fleet DAS. This requirement should minimize the effect of fishing for winter flounder in state waters on other regulated
species of groundfish. 
Vessels fishing in state waters under the winter flounder exemption program would be subject to possession limits
that would vary, depending on the vessel's gear type and the category of the Federal multispecies permit it holds.
Vessels fishing with gillnets, vessels less than 45 ft (13.7 m) in length, and vessels under the individual or fleet
DAS program may harvest an unlimited amount of winter flounder and not more than 500 lbs (226.8 kg) of the remaining
regulated species other than winter flounder. Vessels using hook gear still would not be subject to any possession
limits on multispecies. Vessels fishing with a possession limit only permit would be subject to the 500-lb (226.8-kg)
possession limit for regulated species.

Classification 



The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this action
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action proposed by this rule will
provide an undetermined amount of regulatory relief to affected fishing vessels, all of which are small entities.
It is unknown how many vessels will choose to fish exclusively in state waters on a given trip if this rule is implemented.


This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is 
proposing revisions in subpart C (Child Labor Reg. No. 3) to 
provide an exception from the permissible hours and time 
standards for minors 14 and 15 years of age when employed as 
attendants in professional sports. The proposed exception 
limits such employment to outside school hours and to duties 
customarily performed by typical sports attendants (e.g., 
batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, etc.). Technical 
modifications are proposed in the procedure for obtaining 
occupational variations for 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in 
Work Experience and Career Exploration Programs. Among 
other revisions to update these regulations, the Department 
is also proposing to delete the procedures relating to 
hazardous occupation determinations in Subpart D (Child 
Labor Reg. 5), which, for the most part, have been replaced 
by the notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative 
Procedure Act.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed rules contain no reporting or 
recordkeeping requirements subject to the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). The information 
collection requirements contained in  570.35a, which are 
not modified by this proposal, were previously approved by 
the Office of Management and Budget under OMB control number 
1215-0121. The general FLSA information collection 
requirements (including requirements contained in part 570) 
were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 
the control number 1215-0017. 



II. Background 



The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 14 years for 
employment in most nonagricultural occupations. The 
Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation 
for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age 
in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, 
and during periods and under conditions which will not 
interfere with their schooling or with their health and 
well-being. These provisions also permit 16- and 17-year- 
old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, 
without hours or time limitations, subject to prohibitions 
on occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor 
to be particularly hazardous, or detrimental to the health 
or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, 
minors 14 and older may be engaged in general employment, 
subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly 
hazardous by the Secretary of Labor. Additionally, in 
agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with 
written parental consent or on a farm where the minor's 
parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver 
conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be employed outside of 
school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short 
season crops for a maximum annual period of eight weeks. 

The regulations for 14-and 15-year-olds are known as 
Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in 
subpart C of 29 CFR Part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits 
the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: 

(1) Outside school hours;

(2) Not more than 40 hours in any one week when school 
is not in session; 

(3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school 
is in session; 

(4) Not more than 8 hours in any day when school is 
not in session; 

(5) Not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in 
session; and 

(6) Between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; except during the 
summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening 
hour is extended to 9 p.m. 

Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside 
school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and 
15-year-olds enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised 
Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may 
be employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on 
school days, and during school hours. 

Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds 
in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline 
service establishments, and prohibits their employment in 
certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous 
occupational orders. 

The Department is proposing an exception from the above 
permissible hours and time standards for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as attendants in professional sports. The

Department suspended enforcement of the child labor 
regulations as applied to batboys/girls employed in 
professional baseball during the 1993 baseball season, and 
subsequently extended the policy to attendants in other 
professional sports while reviewing such employment under 
the child labor regulations. 

During 1986 and 1987, the Department conducted a study 
at the request of the Congress
 to determine whether a 
change in the permissible hours of employment for batboys 
and batgirls would be detrimental to their well-being and 
whether any changes to existing standards should be 
proposed. The Department concluded that changes in 
permissible hours and time standards for batboy/girl work 
would not be detrimental to their health and well-being. 
The Department surveyed 157 professional league baseball 
teams and conducted selected on-site interviews with 
parents, teachers, team owners, and batboys/girls and found 
that youths genuinely enjoyed the experience. The 
Department could find no evidence that school grades were 
adversely affected by such work. The Department also 
advised the Congress that regulatory modifications, rather 
than legislative change, would be the best vehicle to 
address the matter of permissible hours for batboys/girls. 





The Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC), 
established in 1987 to provide advice and guidance in the 
development of possible proposals to change existing 
standards, recommended that existing hours and time of work 
standards be retained for 14- and 15-year-olds employed as 
sports attendants, including batboys/girls; and that the 
work performed in such activity be limited to traditional 
duties, i.e., putting out and taking in field equipment, 
running errands for players, and supplying the umpire with 
balls. While the Committee's advisory view was taken into 
consideration, the Department also continued to consider 
other pertinent information, including inquiries received 
from interested parties concerning the employment of youth 
in sports-related activities, such as scorekeepers, 
concession stand helpers, ball monitors and sideline 
officials. One inquiry concerned conforming the Federal 
child labor regulations to a State of Wisconsin provision 
which permits youths under age 14 to be employed by high 
schools as ball monitors and sideline officials at football 
games. Another was received from the Grant County (Kansas) 
Recreation Commission concerning 14- and 15-year-olds 
employed as scorekeepers and concession stand helpers in 
summer softball, baseball, and other sports programs. Also, 
the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, 
Inc. (NAPBL) petitioned
 the Department in June 1993 to 
revise the regulation to permit the employment of 14- and 
15-year-olds as batboys for professional baseball clubs. 
According to the NAPBL, existing hours and time-of-day 
standards effectively preclude baseball teams from lawfully 
employing youth under the age of 16. The NAPBL contended 
further that such employment is not adverse to the health 
and well-being of youth and that the denial of the 
batboy/girl experience is inconsistent with the intent of 
the FLSA's child labor provisions.

Some employers are covered by all of FLSA's provisions, 
while others are covered by the FLSA but may be exempt from 
its minimum wage and overtime provisions though not its 
child labor provisions.
 Other employers that are not 
covered by the FLSA are subject to varying State child labor 
requirements. The practice of providing sport-attendant 
experiences to America's youth is a longstanding tradition. 
As a consequence, many professional and semi-professional 
sports teams, i.e., baseball, basketball, etc., have 
violated Federal child labor regulations by employing 
underage youth, particularly 14- and 15-year-olds, as 
sports-attendants. 




The Department believes that a change in the existing 
Federal hours and times standards to allow employment of 14- 
and 15-year-olds as batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, or in 
other sports-attendant capacities would not be inconsistent 
with FLSA's oppressive child labor provisions and, 
therefore, proposes a narrow exception from the requirements 
of Child Labor Reg. 3 for such work. Specifically, the 
proposed exception is limited to employment by professional 
sports organizations and would apply only if the duties 
performed are traditional in nature and the work is outside 
regular school hours. Thus, the current restrictions when 
school is in session, i.e, 3-hour daily limit, 18-hour 
weekly limit, and 7 p.m. end-of-day time restriction, and 
the current 9 p.m. end-of-day time restriction when school 
in not in session would not apply to 14- and 15-year-old 
sports-attendants. 

The Department recognizes that a delicate balance 
exists between the value of jobs that provide positive, 
formative experiences, and the possible negative effects 
that excessive employment of youth can have on their 
academic performance and their health and well-being. The 
Department believes that the proposed change for 14- and 15-year-olds in sports attending activities will not have
an 
adverse effect on their health, well-being, or educational 
development. Further, the Department believes that the 
employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds as 
provided herein is consistent with the purpose of the FLSA 
to permit safe and healthy employment opportunities under 
conditions which protect the health, well-being, and 
schooling of such young workers. See 29 U.S.C. 203(l). 

In addition, the Department proposes to delete the 
regulations at 29 CFR part 570, subpart D (Child Labor Reg. 
5). These regulations provide a procedure for the Secretary 
to promulgate or amend hazardous occupation orders (HOs), 
which identify occupations in which employment of minors 
under 18 years of age is prohibited because the Secretary, 
pursuant to section 3(l) of the Act, has determined that the 
occupations are particularly hazardous for such workers or 
detrimental to their health or well-being. The Department 
proposes to repeal Child Labor Reg. 5, because its 
procedural requirements are no longer necessary, and because 
the continued existence of the regulation poses the 
potential for confusion regarding the process to be utilized 
by the Secretary in the review, amendment, and promulgation 
of HOs. 



Child Labor Reg. 5 was promulgated in 1938, immediately 
after the enactment of the FLSA (3 FR 2640 (1938)). 
Although neither the FLSA nor other laws required such 
procedures, the Children's Bureau, which at that time was 
charged with administration of the FLSA child labor 
provisions, prescribed the process so that the public would 
be informed of the Department's intentions regarding the 
creation or amendment of restrictions on the employment of 
minors in hazardous occupations. The original Child Labor 
Reg. 5 identified certain mandatory steps, including public 
hearings, to be taken in HO promulgation. The Congress, 
however, imposed a standardized procedure in 1946 for all 
Federal agencies to follow when issuing or amending 
regulations. The procedures in this law, the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA), 60 Stat. 237, provide greater 
administrative flexibility than the process in Child Labor 
Reg. 5, in that, for example, the APA does not mandate a 
public hearing in every case prior to promulgation of a 
regulation. There have been no changes to Child Labor Reg. 
5 except for a technical amendment in 1961 (26 FR 5005 
(1961)) to more align the HO process with APA requirements, 
i.e., hearings were identified among various optional steps 
which the Department could utilize.

It is the Department's view that Child Labor Reg. 5 is 
no longer necessary. The procedures set out in this 
regulation are not substantively different from the APA 
requirements which control DOL rulemaking, including 
promulgation of HOs. While the optional steps identified in 
the regulation are matters which the Department may choose 
to undertake in the promulgation of particular HOs, these 
steps_involving study, drafting, examination, and review 
of options and standards_are integral parts of the 
Department's deliberative, policy-making process and, thus, 
they need not and should not be set out in detail in 
regulations. Further, it is the Department's view that the 
regulation potentially creates confusion in that the Child 
Labor Reg. 5 procedures may be viewed incorrectly as 
mandatory steps for promulgation of HOs. The proposed 
repeal of Child Labor Reg. 5 will eliminate the possibility 
of confusion. 

The Department is also proposing a technical 
modification in the regulations that is considered necessary 
and appropriate in connection with the Work Experience and 
Career Exploration Program (WECEP) to facilitate 
applications for certification under this program. 
Section 570.35a of the regulations provides for the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in a State-approved, 
school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration 
Program (WECEP).
 A condition for approval of such programs 
is that they provide sufficient safeguards to ensure that 
the employment will not interfere with the schooling of the 
minors or with their health and well-being. Enrollees in 
approved WECEPs may be employed for up to 23 hours in school 
weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours, in 
occupations other than:





(1) Those in manufacturing and 
mining; 

(2) Those declared to be hazardous for the 
employment of minors under 18 years of age (set forth in 
subpart E of the regulations); or

(3) Those declared to be 
hazardous for employment of minors below the age of 16 in 
agriculture (set forth in subpart E-1 of the regulations). 

The regulations at  570.35a(c)(3) allow the 
Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division to approve a 
variance from the prohibited occupations in individual cases 
or classes of cases after notice to interested parties and 
an opportunity to furnish views. In State Educational 
Agency applications for WECEP program approval and requests 
for variances from the Reg. 3 occupations restrictions in 
those programs pursuant to  570.35a(c)(3), the Department 
has consistently approved variances for particular 
activities which, within the operation of programs that meet 
all the WECEP criteria, have been determined by the 
Department not to interfere with the health and well-being 
of the 14- and 15-year-olds enrolled in the programs. To 
provide pertinent guidance to the State Educational Agencies 
and other interested parties, the Department proposes to 
amend the WECEP regulations to specify that the following 
activities will be ordinarily considered to be acceptable 
for participants in approved WECEP programs: 




(1) Using a deep fryer or cooking at a grill with a 
maximum temperature of 375 degrees; 

(2) Operating power-driven mowers, weed-eaters, 
trimmers and whips with nylon string only; 

(3) Retrieving and/or placing food in 
coolers/freezers; 

(4) Loading and unloading goods weighing up to 30 lbs. 
provided that such work does not exceed 30 percent 
of the minor's weekly hours worked; and

<PARENT> FR940513-1-00021 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Operating noncommercial dishwashers.




In effect, the revised WECEP regulations would contain a 
limited exception to the Reg. 3 occupations restrictions for 
WECEP participants engaged in the specified activities. 
Further, in order to preserve the Department's discretion to 
modify the Reg. 3 restrictions in special circumstances 
where a WECEP program applicant can demonstrate that the 
program will provide safe and suitable employment, the WECEP 
regulation will continue to contain a provision for 
obtaining variances from occupational restrictions similar 
to variance procedures under other programs administered by 
the Department's Wage and Hour Division, e.g., see  5.14 
of 29 CFR part 5 (Davis-Bacon and Related Acts) and  4.123 
of 29 CFR part 4 (McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act). 
In addition, the Department is proposing to delete 
the exception contained in  570.35(b) for enrollees in work 
training programs conducted under the Economic Opportunity 
Act of 1964. This Act has been repealed and the exception 
is no longer appropriate. 


Executive Order 12866 


The Department believes that this proposed rule is not 
a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of 
Executive Order 12866. It proposes to change the 
permissible hours and time standards to permit greater 
flexibility in the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds as 
professional sports attendants. While the changes proposed 
are expected to enhance opportunities for employment, the 
impact on overall employment levels of 14- and 15-year-olds 
is modest. Other proposed changes are technical in nature 
and are expected to have only a minor impact on the 
employment of 14- and 15-year-olds. Accordingly, these 
changes are not expected to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more 
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector 
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the 
environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or 
tribal governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious 
inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or 
planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the 
budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising 
out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
principles set forth in Executive Order 12866. Therefore, 
no regulatory impact analysis has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 


The Department has determined that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The proposed change to provide an 
exception from the permissible hours and time standards for 
minors 14 and 15 years of age when employed as attendants in 
professional sports has narrow application and will affect 
only a limited number of employers of which some may be 
considered small entities. Although the other technical 
changes may affect small entities, the impact is believed to 
be insignificant. For these reasons, the Department 
believes that the proposed rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
The Secretary of Labor has certified to this effect to the 
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility 
analysis is required.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor (Department or DOL) is considering proposing revisions in the child labor regulations issued
pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 CFR part 570, which set forth the criteria for the permissible employment
of minors under 18 years of age. In particular, subparts C and E of these regulations are under review. Subpart C (Child
Labor Reg. 3) specifies permissible hours and time standards, as well as occupational limitations, for 14- and 15-year-old
employees. Subpart E identifies occupations deemed particularly hazardous for, or detrimental to the health or
well-being of, employees under 18 years of age. This advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeks the views of the public
on needed changes to these regulations, and also with respect to other aspects of the regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establish a minimum age of 14 years for employment
in most nonagricultural occupations. The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide by regulation for the employment
of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods
and under conditions which will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being. These provisions
also permit 16- and 17-year-old minors to be employed in the nonagricultural sector, without hours or time limitations,
subject to prohibitions in occupations found and declared by the Secretary of Labor to be particularly hazardous,
or detrimental to the health or well-being of minors under age 18. In agriculture, minors 14 and older may be engaged
in general employment, subject to prohibitions on occupations declared particularly hazardous by the Secretary
of Labor. Additionally, in agriculture 12- and 13-year-olds may be employed with written parental consent or on a
farm where the minor's parent is also employed. Under very limited waiver conditions, 10- and 11-year-olds may be
employed outside of school hours in agriculture as hand harvesters of short season crops for a maximum annual period
of eight weeks. 


The regulations for 14- and 15-year olds are known as Child Labor Regulation No. 3 (Reg. 3) and are contained in subpart
C of 29 CFR part 570. Reg. 3, as amended, limits the hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work to: 
(1) Outside school hours; 
(2) Not more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in session; 
(3) Not more than 18 hours in any one week when school is in session; 
(4) Not more than 8 hours in any day when school is not in session; 
(5) Not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in session; and 
(6) between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., except during the summer (June 1 through Labor Day) when the evening hour is extended to
9 p.m.

Summer school sessions are considered to be ``outside school hours,'' i.e., nonschool weeks. Also, 14- and 15-year-olds
enrolled in a State-approved, school-supervised Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be
employed for up to 23 hours in school weeks, 3 hours on school days, and during school hours.
 




Child Labor Reg. 3 permits work by 14- and 15-year-olds in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline
service establishments, and prohibits their employment in certain other work, including work prohibited by hazardous
occupational orders. 
Pursuant to the FLSA child labor provisions, the Secretary has issued standards governing employment of minors under
18 years of age in nonagriculture occupations. The 17 nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders (HOs) now in
effect are contained in 29 CFR part 570, subpart E. Prohibitions established by these HOs apply either on an industry
basis, specifying the occupations in the industry that are not covered, or on an occupational basis irrespective
of the industry in which performed. The current nonagricultural HOs deal with manufacturing and storing explosives
(HO 1); motor-vehicle driving and outside helper (HO 2); coal mining (HO 3); logging and sawmilling (HO 4); power-driven
woodworking machines (HO 5); exposure to radioactive substances (HO 6); power-driven hoisting apparatus (HO 7);
power-driven metal-forming, punching, and shearing machines (HO 8); mining, other than coal mining (HO 9); slaughtering,
or meat-packing, processing, or rendering (HO 10); power-driven bakery machines (HO 11); power-driven paper-products
machines (HO 12); manufacturing brick, tile, and kindred products (HO 13); power-driven circular saws (HO 14); wrecking,
demolition, and ship-breaking operations (HO 15); roofing operations (HO 16); and excavation operations (HO 17).

Occupations in agriculture found particularly hazardous and, consequently, prohibited by the Secretary for children
below the age of 16 are contained in subpart E-1 of 29 CFR part 570. 
Because of changes in the workplace and the introduction of new processes and technologies since the adoption of current
regulatory standards, as well as changes in places where young workers find employment opportunities, the existence
of differing Federal and State standards, and the divergent views on how best to correlate school and work experiences,
the Department is undertaking a comprehensive review of the criteria for child labor employment, and is considering
proposing revisions to Regulations, 29 CFR part 570. Accordingly, this advance notice of proposed rulemaking is
being published to obtain the views of the public with respect to the matters set out below as well as to any other issues
of interest under this regulation. 


I. Permissible Hours, Time-of-day, and Occupational Standards Under Child Labor Reg. 3 


Since the regulations relating to hours, time and occupations were last amended, the Department has engaged in periodic
reviews of the appropriateness of these regulations. 
Thus, for example, in 1982, the Department published a proposal in the 

Federal Register

 to, among other things, modify the permissible periods of work for 14- and 15-year-olds.
 This proposal would have increased the maximum daily hours from 3 to 4 hours on a school day, and increased the maximum
weekly hours of employment when school is in session from 18 to 24 hours. The proposal would have further permitted
14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 36 hours in any week when school was in session for only a portion of the week due to holidays
or vacation periods. Finally, this proposal would have generally expanded the end-of-day time restriction from
7 to 9 p.m. on school days, and would have established a 10 p.m. end-of-day limit on any day during the summer months or
preceding a nonschool day. The 1982 proposal generated considerable public interest and controversy. The Department
subsequently suspended the proposal from further consideration, and it was not implemented as a final rule.
 





In August 1987, the Department established a Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC)
 to provide advice and guidance in the development of possible proposals to change existing standards. In its review
of hours and time of work issues, the Committee recommended that existing hours and time of work standards be retained
without modification. 




In the U.S. Congress, bills have been introduced in the House and Senate that include, among other things, hours and
time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-old employees. Bills to reform the FLSA's child labor provisions, H.R. 1106,
introduced February 24, 1993, and S. 86, introduced January 21, 1993, would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to work only
for 3 hours a day and 15 hours a week, or between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. when school is in session. Under H.R. 1106,
16- and 17-year-old minors could not, for the first time, work more than 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, or before 6 a.m.
or after 10 p.m. when school is in session. These hours and time restrictions for 14- and 15-year-olds are similar to
the existing regulations, except that the bills set a 15 hours-per-week limit (rather than the current, regulatory
18).

Under a model State child labor law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition (a child labor advocacy group of 35 organizations
interested in updating child labor laws), the maximum hours of employment for 14- and 15-year-olds would be set at
15 hours a week while in school, and 30 hours a week when school is not in session. For 16- and 17-year-olds, the maximum
work hours would be 30 when school is in session and 40 hours when it is not. 
The Department has also continued to receive input from the public suggesting that certain changes be made in the regulations.

5

 The National Restaurant Association (NRA), the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA),
and the Fresno (California) Private Industry Council, among others, have requested that the Department change the
regulations. Correspondence has also been received from individual employers, Members of Congress, and members
of State legislatures. 




In 1992, for example, the NRA noted that nearly 20 percent of employed teens work in food service occupations and that
roughly 25 percent of the industry's hourly workers are in their teens. The NRA also pointed to a high overall teen unemployment
rate and suggested a number of reforms to the regulations, including:

 

(1) Allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 24 hours a week when school is in session for four days or less due to holiday
or vacation breaks (currently limited to 18 hours during weeks when school is in session for one or more days); 
(2) Expanding the limit to 4 hours on Sundays through Thursdays, i.e., days followed by school days, and to 8 hours on
Fridays and Saturdays (currently limited to 3 hours on school days); 
(3) Changing the 7 p.m. limitation during the school year to 9 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and to 11 p.m on Fridays
and Saturdays; and 
(4) Changing the 9 p.m. limitation during the summer vacations (from June 1 to Labor Day) to 11 p.m. 



Reforms suggested by the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) include: 



(1) Allowing 14- and 15-year-olds to work up to 24 hours a week when school is in session for 5 days, and up to 36 hours a
week when school is in session for any part of a week due to holidays or vacation (with the actual hours limit determined
by subtracting from 40 hours, 4 hours for each day that school is in session during the partial school week); 
(2) Changing the current 3-hours-per-day limit when school is in session to 4 hours; and 
(3) Changing the 9 p.m. end-of-day limitation during the summer period to 11 p.m.

 

The Department is also aware of the child labor standards established by State governments. In this regard, nearly
all States have employment restrictions applicable to young workers and, although many have adopted standards similar
to the Federal standards for 14- and 15-year-olds, the restrictions vary significantly. For example, most States
limit the number of hours that may be worked in a day when school is not in session to 8 hours; only three States allow more
than 8 hours of work in a day when school is not in session. Most States limit the number of hours that may be worked in a
week when school is not in session to 40 hours; fifteen States, however, permit work in excess of 40 hours when school
is not in session, with the number of hours allowed ranging from 44 to 56. With respect to the number of hours that may
be worked in a week when school is in session, a large number of the States do not have any specific restrictions. Eighteen
States restrict work to no more than 18 hours; two States restrict work to 16 and 15 hours, respectively; two States
restrict work hours to 18 hours but allow more hours when school is not in session for a full week; and seven other States
have provisions that allow work in excess of 20 hours a week when school is in session. 
Of the States that restrict daily work hours, 20 provide for a 3-hour limitation on a school day, whether or not the following
day is a school day; one State sets a 3-hour limit on days followed by a school day; and one State permits longer hours
on Saturdays and Sundays. A daily limit of 4 hours is allowed by seven States, with one of these States permitting additional
hours on Fridays and on a school day preceding a day when school is not in session. 
Four States have established maximum permissible daily and/or weekly combined school and work hours, i.e., 10 total
hours of combined school and work on a daily basis, or 48 total hours of combined school and work on a weekly basis. 
In 28 States, work beyond 7 p.m. is prohibited except during the summer, on a holiday, or on a day preceding a day when
school is not in session, when work until 9 p.m. is allowed in 26 of these States, and until 10 p.m. in the other two States.
Two additional States prohibit work after 7 p.m. at all times. An additional 19 States allow work at least until 8 p.m.;
another five States permit work until 
10 p.m. 
In addition to allowing more working hours during the summer, State standards often distinguish between days preceding
a school day from those preceding a non-school day. Several States also make a distinction between full school weeks
and weeks when school is in partial session because of holiday and vacation time, permitting more hours to be worked
in partial school weeks.

Under the Department's Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP), which began in 1969, 14- and 15-year-old
enrollees were initially permitted to work up to 28 hours per week when school was in session and up to 4 hours on a school
day, any portion of which could be during school hours. Studies of WECEP indicated that limited labor market experience
in a controlled school setting had a definite positive impact on the scholastic performance and school attendance
of participating 14- and 15-year-old students. These studies also established that the optimum hours_at which students
attained the greatest educational benefits_were fewer than the maximum hours originally allowed. As a result, in
1975, the permissible hours of employment under WECEP were reduced to 3 hours per day and 23 hours per week, and these
revised standards were adopted in final regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 3, 1975. See 29 CFR 570.35a(d). 
The Department is also aware that some employers of young workers have adopted special programs designed to achieve
complementary integration of educational and work experiences. Such employers may, for example, ascertain young
workers' grade point averages (GPA) at the time of hiring; arrange work schedules, subject to parental consent, to
accommodate the scholastic needs of students; allow young workers to study at the workplace; give bonuses for superior
academic achievement or school attendance; monitor young workers' academic performance and school attendance
during employment; and ensure that students, prior to hiring, know their employment rights and the regulations applicable
to minors. 
The Department seeks comments on whether there is a need for changes in the requirements of Child Labor Reg. 3 for students
participating in programs under statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems advocated by the School-to-Work
initiative jointly sponsored by the Departments of Education and Labor (see 59 FR 5266 (February 3, 1994) and 59 FR
11154 (March 9, 1994)). Programs developed under this initiative are intended to give youth access to education and
training opportunities that will prepare them for high-skill, high-wage careers. 
The Department, for the reasons discussed above, is particularly interested in obtaining public comment on the appropriateness
and feasibility of the following matters: 
1. Should greater flexibility be allowed in the permissible hours of work for 14- and 15-year-olds whose employers
have a formal ``employer-parent-school'' program that links meaningful work experiences with support for the attainment
of the student-employee's educational goals and ongoing academic performance? Commenters are requested to include
specific recommendations as to the standards or criteria that should be considered for inclusion in any future rulemaking
to define such special programs, and as to the changes in permissible work hours that would be appropriate for 14- and
15-year-olds whose employers maintain such programs. Commenters are also requested to provide information regarding
the implications for employer recordkeeping that might be necessary for the Department to monitor compliance with
the standards for any such programs, and recommendations for how these recordkeeping requirements should be addressed.

2. The current regulations contain an end-of-day restriction of 7 p.m. on days when school is in session. A less restrictive
time of 9 p.m. is permitted during the summer vacation period defined in the regulations as June 1 through the Labor
Day holiday. When school is in session, the regulations make no distinction between a day preceding a school day and
one preceding a non-school day, i.e., typically Fridays, Saturdays, and days before a school holiday. Should there
be different restrictions on times of work on days preceding a non-school day and, if so, why? Would any such changes
interfere with the schooling, health, or well-being of young workers? If an end-of-day restriction different from
7 p.m. is appropriate on days preceding a non-school day, what should the time restriction be on such days, and why?
Should the Department consider a later end-of-day time for work during the summer months when school is not in session?
If so, what should that time be and why? 
3. The regulations currently limit the daily hours that may be worked by 14- and 15-year-olds to 3 hours on days when
school is in session; 8 hours when school is not in session. Should a distinction be made in the number of hours that may
be worked on a day preceding a non-school day (typically Friday, Saturday, and the day before a school holiday) and,
if so, how many hours should be permitted and why? 
4. Weekly hours for 14- and 15-year-olds are limited by the regulations to 18 hours when school is in session. While
some States permit more hours, only two limit permissible weekly hours to less than the 18-hour standard, one to 16
and another to 15. On the other hand, the child labor reform bill pending in the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R.
1106) and the Model state law drafted by the Child Labor Coalition would limit the number of hours that may be worked
each week to 15. Should the existing Federal standard be changed and, if so, how many hours should be permitted and why?
Should a distinction be made for those weeks when school is in session less than five days?

5. Traditionally, schools were not ``in session'' during the summer months and the regulations reflected this common
schedule by providing less-restrictive hours and time limitations during the summer vacation period between June
1 and the Labor Day holiday. School systems, however, have begun converting to non-traditional attendance schedules
and remain open year-round. For example, some public and private schools have implemented academic quarter-year,
trimester, or other alternative attendance schedules under which the schools schedule classes year-round, but
not all students are attending school at any point in time. For these schools, the traditional concept of the ``summer
vacation break'' between June 1 and Labor Day has become irrelevant. Additionally, home education programs are now
more common, not only in school jurisdictions where the public schools operate on uniform attendance calendars applicable
to all students, but also in school jurisdictions where the public schools operate year-round or on a platoon system.
Should the regulations be changed to accommodate different structures for when school is ``in session'' and what
are the particular changes that should be made to reflect the characteristics of alternative school schedules? If
the concept is based on the schedule for school attendance of individual student-employees (rather than the entire
school system), how do employers and student-employees determine when different hours restrictions are applicable
and what records would have to be maintained to ensure compliance? 

The Department is also reviewing the occupational provisions contained in Reg. 3 to determine what changes, modifications,
or clarifications, if any, are appropriate for 14- and 15-year-old employees. The Department is interested in obtaining
public comment on all aspects of these provisions, including the following matters: 

1. Section 570.34(b)(5), promulgated prior to the advent of the fast food industry, prohibits cooking by 14- and 15-year-olds
employed by retail and food establishment cooking at soda fountains, lunch counters, snack bars, or cafeteria serving
counters. This prohibition has been interpreted by the Department to allow cooking only when the activity is in ``plain
view'' of customers. Thus, the cooking prohibition applies to full service restaurants and certain fast food restaurants
where the cooking configuration does not permit customers to plainly view the cooking activity. Should cooking be
permitted in retail and food establishments, and, if so, what restrictions, if any, would be appropriate to ensure
the safety and health of young workers? Should all cooking be prohibited, and, if so, why? 

2. Section 570.33(b) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in any occupation which involves ``* * *
any power-driven machinery other than office machines.'' The operation of certain power-driven devices, equipment,
and tools in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments is expressly permitted by  570.34.
In such industries, 14- and 15-year-olds may, for example, operate vacuum cleaners, floor waxers, dishwashers,
toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, and coffee grinders. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds
are also permitted to operate office machines in connection with office and clerical work and cash registers in connection
with retail sales work. Should any of the machines, 

etc., 

expressly permitted in Reg. 3 be reconsidered because their use adversely affects the health and well-being of such
workers? If so, why? Are there power-driven machines, 

etc., 

in the contemporary workplace not now expressly permitted by Reg. 3 which 14- and 15-year-olds should be allowed to
operate? If so, identify the machines and explain why their use should be permitted. Also, questions periodically
arise about the meaning of ``power-driven'' and whether the term includes tools, equipment, 

etc., 

that are activated by battery power, i.e., many tools and devices are now power-activated by rechargeable battery
units. Should the term ``power-driven'' include equipment, tools, etc. powered by such sources, and why or why not?


3. In addition, consideration is being given to two clarifying modifications which would incorporate existing Departmental
enforcement policy into the regulations. Section 570.34(b)(7) prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from working in freezers
and meat coolers. Such workers are prohibited from working as dairy stock clerks, meat clerks, deli clerks, produce
clerks, or frozen-food stock clerks where their duties would require them to enter and remain in coolers or freezers
for prolonged periods. Inventory and cleanup work involving prolonged stays in freezers and coolers also is prohibited.
On the other hand, food preparers in fast food restaurants or cashiers in grocery stores whose duties require entry
to such refrigeration equipment only momentarily to retrieve items are not considered as working in coolers and freezers
for enforcement purposes. Because this traditional interpretation of the ``cooler and freezer'' prohibition is
not specifically contained in the regulations, a regulatory clarification may be appropriate.

<TEXT>
 

Similarly, a regulatory clarification to reflect longstanding policy concerning solicitations for newspaper
subscriptions may be appropriate. Section 13(d) of the FLSA exempts from the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor
provisions (  6, 7, and 12) ``* * * any employee engaged in the delivery of newspapers to
the consumer.'' Accordingly, such work is outside the scope of the child labor regulations. However, the Department
has held, on the basis of a legal opinion from the Solicitor, that the ``newspaper'' exemption does not apply when the
minor is performing nonexempt work such as participation in a sales blitz where newspaper subscriptions are solicited
outside the assigned paper route for delivery by other delivery persons. Should this enforcement position be incorporated
in the provisions of Child Labor Reg. 3? 

The Department recognizes the delicate balance between the value of jobs that provide positive, formative experiences,
and the negative effects that excessive hours of employment of youth can have on their academic performance, and their
health and well-being. Public comments, which should include supporting data whenever available, are specifically
invited on such relevant factors as:




(1) The need for safe and healthy employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds; 

(2) The biological developmental factors, such as muscle coordination and attention span, present in 14- and 15-year-olds
which should be considered with regard to their conditions of employment; 

(3) The educational needs of 14- and 15-year-olds and the effect on their academic success of longer and/or later hours
of work; 

(4) The correlation between longer and/or later hours of work and the safety and health of 14- and 15-year-olds; 

(5) The correlation between employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds and their personal and educational
development; and 

(6) The potential effects of specific changes in the regulations on the employment opportunities of 14- and 15-year-olds.




II. Nonagricultural Hazardous Occupations Orders for the Employment of Youth Under 18 Years of Age 



The first seven HOs were developed under the direction of the Children's Bureau between 1939 and 1946. In 1946, authority
for the program was transferred from the Children's Bureau to the Department of Labor under Reorganization Plan No.
2. HOs 8 through 17 were issued by the Bureau of Labor Standards between 1950 and 1963. In the intervening years, the
Department has made some clarifying modifications to these HOs that largely incorporate Departmental interpretations
and enforcement policy, and hazardous occupations in agricultural were promulgated in 1970. 

As a result of various recommendations made by the Department's Child Labor Advisory Committee (CLAC), a notice of
proposed rulemaking was published to clarify or modify HO 2, HO 10, and HO 12 on October 23, 1990 (55 FR 42812). The final
rule, published on November 20, 1991 (56 FR 58626), clarified the existing HOs to:

(1) Eliminate exemption procedures contained in HO 2 which allowed minors under 18 years of age to work as school bus
drivers;

(2) Specify that restaurants, fast food establishments, and other retail establishments are subject to HO 10 prohibiting
minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven meat processing equipment;

(3) Specifically provide that meat slicers are meat processing equipment within the meaning of the HO 10 prohibitions;
and

(4) Amend HO 12 to expressly prohibit minors under the age of 18 from using power-driven paper baling machinery in the
processing of waste paper. 

The CLAC made a number of additional recommendations which were not included in the HO 2, 10, and 12 rulemaking. For
example, the CLAC recommended that HO 10 be amended to also include bacon slicing machines in the list of prohibited
machines, and to prohibit the use of such machines without regard to the purpose of their use, i.e., power-driven meat
processing machines used primarily for processing products other than meat. The CLAC also was of the view that food
processing in industries other than meat processing, such as poultry, fish, and seafood processing, should be studied
by the Department to determine the need for protecting young workers from hazardous activity. With respect to HO 2,
the CLAC made several recommendations, including defining and delimiting the terms ``occasional and incidental''
driving and ``outside helper,'' specifically prohibiting the operation of trucks on private property, and specifically
excluding motorcycles, mopeds, or similar vehicles from the ``occasional and incidental'' exception. With respect
to HO 11, the CLAC recommended a complete ban on the operation of all power-driven bakery machinery, and also recommended
further study of power-driven paper products machines addressed in HO 12.

Of particular concern to the CLAC was the lack of sufficient and relevant data to support comprehensive review of existing
HOs or findings that certain contemporary occupations, processes, machinery and worksites are particularly hazardous
for employment of youths under age 18, or detrimental to their health or well-being. The lack of comprehensive statistics
on minors injured in the workplace has been a longstanding concern of the Department. Historically, some limited
information was generated, largely from secondary sources and statistical records from the few States that compiled
worker compensation data, to support the case for each of the existing HOs. Fundamental to some of the existing HOs
(e.g., HO 15, shipbreaking), however, was the notion that work found to be particularly hazardous or detrimental
to the health and well-being of adult workers would be injurious to minor workers. 

To address this concern, the Department is continuing its efforts to develop reliable youth injury statistics through
enhancements of information reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). BLS is redesigning its Occupational
Safety and Health Statistical reporting system to collect more comprehensive work-related injury and illness data
on all workers, including young workers. This new system, the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, will
collect information from about 280,000 establishments from a sampling frame of approximately six million establishments.
The new survey will include data by occupation, age, gender, race, and length of service with details on, among other
things, the nature of the injury/illness, the part of body affected, the primary and secondary sources of the injury/illness,
and the event or exposure leading to the injury/illness. BLS has developed another major safety and health data reporting
system with its Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries program. This data base includes information on fatally injured
workers (industry, occupation, age, sex, and race) and the fatal events (nature of the injury and how it happened).


The Department believes that such injury data is essential to support ongoing comprehensive and systematic reviews
of occupations, processes, machinery, and worksites which are particularly hazardous for workers under 18 years
of age, or detrimental to their health or well-being. While such data will enhance the Department's abi
