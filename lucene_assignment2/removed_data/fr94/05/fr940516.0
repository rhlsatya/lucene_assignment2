Citrus Canker Regulations; Quarantined Areas and Survey Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the citrus canker regulations by removing the areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties, FL, from the
list of quarantined areas and by removing the area in Hillsborough County, FL, from the list of survey areas. No evidence
of citrus canker has been found in these areas for at least 2 years. This action is necessary to relieve regulatory restrictions
which are no longer necessary. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Citrus canker is a plant disease caused by strains of the bacterium 

Xanthomonas campestris 

pv. citri. The disease is known to affect plants and plant parts, including fresh fruit, of citrus and citrus relatives
(Family 

Rutaceae). It can cause defoliation and other serious damage to the leaves and twigs of susceptible plants. It may
also make the fruit of infected plants unmarketable by causing lesions on the fruit. Infected fruit may also drop from
trees before reaching maturity. The Asiatic strains of 

Xanthomonas campestris 

pv. 

citri 

(A strains) are aggressive strains. 
In the United States, Florida is the only State where citrus canker has been present in recent years. Regulations to
prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker from Florida are contained in 7 CFR 301.75-1 through 301.75-14,
``Subpart_Citrus Canker'' (referred to below as ``the regulations''). 
The regulations designate certain areas in Florida as quarantined areas and impose restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from and through quarantined areas. The regulations also designate survey areas,
which surround the quarantined areas. Survey areas undergo close monitoring by Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) and State inspectors. 
On March 17, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 12553-12554, Docket No. 93-153-1) a proposal to amend the regulations by removing the areas
in Highlands and Manatee Counties, FL, from the list of quarantined areas, and by removing the area in Hillsborough
County, FL, from the list of survey areas. 
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending April 18, 1994. We received three
comments, two from State agriculture departments and one from an organization of farmers. 
All the commenters supported our proposal. However, one commenter pointed out that some States also impose restrictions
on the movement of citrus plants into their States to prevent the introduction of diseases and pests other than citrus
canker. 
The commenter is correct. Some citrus-producing states restrict the movement of citrus plants into their States
to prevent the introduction of citrus diseases or pests, other than citrus canker, into the State. For this reason,
although we are removing the Federally-imposed citrus canker quarantines in Florida, anyone shipping citrus plants
interstate should be aware that State-imposed restrictions may apply. 
The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. This rule removes the areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties, FL, from the list of quarantined areas and removes
the area in Hillsborough County, FL, from the list of survey areas. This will eliminate the requirement for regular
inspection of groves in the former survey areas in which regulated fruit, trees, and plants are produced, thus reducing
the burden on the operators of the groves and on APHIS and Florida State agencies, which provide inspectors to perform
the inspections. Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined
that this rule should be made effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

Under this final rule, all areas in Highlands and Manatee Counties are released from their classification as quarantined
areas, and the area in Hillsborough County is released from its classification as a survey area. Citrus plants, plant
parts, citrus fruit, and other regulated articles from formerly quarantined areas are allowed to be moved interstate
to other areas in the United States, including commercial citrus-producing areas, and regulated articles are allowed
to be moved interstate through quarantined areas. Requirements which apply to survey areas are also removed. 
We have determined that 237 individuals and businesses will be economically affected by the changes. These individuals
and businesses include: lawn care companies (82), grove owners (74 persons who own 2,177 acres), retail nursery outlets
(21), fruit processors (15), fruit harvesting contractors (12), fruit shippers (12), fresh fruit packing houses
(11), nurseries (9), and seed extractors (1). APHIS believes that virtually all of these individuals and businesses
are small entities. 
It should be noted that the costs of compliance were, in many cases, minimal, and that the individuals and businesses
affected by the regulations represent less than one percent of all similar individuals and businesses in Florida.

One of the largest groups of affected individuals and business is grove owners. We estimate that this rule change will
save each affected grove owner approximately $25 per acre, per year, by removing requirements for 
cleaning and disinfecting vehicles, equipment, and personnel leaving their groves. These costs represent a small
percentage of the owners' overall production costs. 

In addition, this final rule will allow grove owners to expand the areas into which their fruit could be moved interstate,
in that they will be allowed to move fruit interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. We anticipate that any
impact from this rule change will be negligible, as approximately 90 percent of all of Florida's citrus production
is for the juice market, and only about 10 percent is for the fresh fruit market. 
In addition to grove owners in the quarantined areas, truckers, packing and processing plants, and lawn services
within the currently quarantined areas will no longer be subject to inspection and will no longer need to carry out
activities now required by the regulations. This should result in financial savings to these entities. This also
means that groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement, regulated trees, and regulated plants in the
current survey area will no longer be subject to regular inspections for citrus canker. This change will reduce the
burden on APHIS and Florida State agencies, which currently provide inspectors to perform inspections. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3 and
-7 Series Engines 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes.
This action requires inspections of the forward lower engine mount bolts for migration and damage, inspections of
the bolt bushings for damage, torque checks of the nuts installed on these bolts, and correction of any discrepancies.
This amendment is prompted by reports of migration of the bolts that attach the forward engine mount universal block
to the engine lugs. The actions specified 
in this AD are intended to prevent migration of the bolts out of the engine lug joint, which could result in loss of the
engine from the strut.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Five operators of Boeing Model 747 series 
airplanes, equipped with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3 and -7 series engines, have reported cases of migration
of the bolts that attach the forward engine mount universal block to the engine lugs. Investigation of the most recent
case, which occurred in February 1994, revealed that an engine mount bolt's self-locking nut was missing and the bolt
had partially migrated out of the forward engine mount universal block to engine lug joint. The bolt migrated approximately
one inch inboard, so that the bolt retainer device sheared and the bolt head came in contact with the thrust reverser
air supply duct; this caused the duct to be chafed, dented, and cracked. The reason for the missing self-locking nut
has not been determined. 



A similar incident was reported in 1982. During troubleshooting of the fan thrust reverser, one operator found an
engine mount bolt that had migrated due to the loss of the self-locking nut. Like the most recent case, the reason for
the missing self-locking nut was not determined. Prior to this incident, two other operators had reported migration
of this same bolt after the loss of the nut and washer. 

If the bolt were to completely migrate out of the joint, the engine could separate from the strut. Separation of an engine
from the strut could result in reduced controllability of the airplane. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-71A2269, dated April 14, 1994, that describes
procedures for repetitive inspections of the forward lower engine mount bolt for migration and replacement of the
nuts if bolt migration exists. It also describes procedures for inspecting the bolts and bolt bushings for damage,
replacing damaged bolts and bushings, installing new nuts and modified washers for these bolts, and torque-checking
the nut. 

The FAA also has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747-71-2192, dated March 2, 1984, that
contains procedures for installing steel retention brackets. Installation of these brackets will improve secondary
retention of the two bolts that engage the universal block at the lower forward engine mount. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Boeing Model 747 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent complete migration of the forward lower engine mount bolt
out of the joint, which could result in the separation of the engine from the strut. This AD requires repetitive visual
inspections of the bolt for migration and replacement of the nuts if bolt migration exists; inspection of the bolts
and bolt bushings for damage, and replacement of 
damaged bolts and bushings; and a torque check of the nut. These actions are required to be accomplished in accordance
with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-71A2269, described previously. 

Operators who have previously installed steel retention brackets, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747-71-2192,
as well as nuts having part number NAS1805 and certain modified washers, are permitted to conduct the repetitive inspections
for bolt migration at longer intervals than operators without these items installed on the airplane.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

The FAA is considering further rulemaking action to revise this rule to require the installation of steel retention
brackets, nuts having part number NAS1805, and modified washers on all engine mount bolts. However, the proposed
compliance time for these actions is sufficiently long so that notice and time for prior public comment would not be
impracticable. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ``ADDRESSES.''
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-59-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned
to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model ATP Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes,
that requires revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit flight in certain freezing precipitation conditions.
This AD also provides an optional terminating action for the AFM revision. This amendment is prompted by reports of
engine power rollback (loss of engine power) that occurred in environmental conditions involving freezing precipitation.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in freezing precipitation.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all British Aerospace Model ATP airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 3, 1993 (58 FR 46916). That action proposed to require revising the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit
flight in certain freezing precipitation conditions. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 

One commenter supports the proposed rule, but suggests that the action should have been issued to require immediate
compliance to reduce the traveling public's exposure to the potential risk of loss of multiple engine power during
flight in freezing precipitation and possible unplanned landings. The commenter also requests that, since the AD
was issued as a proposal, the time required for publication of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

 be kept to a minimum so as not to induce an additional administrative delay that would only delay compliance. 

The FAA does not concur with the commenter's suggestion that the final rule be issued to require immediate compliance.
At the time of issuance of the proposal, the FAA could not justify that an immediate safety of flight problem existed,
especially in light of the fact that the single operator of the entire U.S. fleet of Model ATP airplanes already had
added an operating restriction similar to that required by this AD to its FAA-approved operation specifications
and had agreed to operate in accordance with that restriction until further corrective action could be identified
and incorporated. Moreover, the operating limitation was proposed by the FAA since, at that time, the airplane manufacturer,
the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, and the FAA were
uncertain as to the cause of the engine power rollback problem described in the preamble to the proposal. However,
considerable information was available at that time to indicate that the problem was due to ice ingestion into the
engines during certain meteorological conditions. That data, however, had not yet been confirmed through testing
conducted by the manufacturer and the CAA. Consequently, the FAA determined that a requirement to prohibit flight
in certain freezing precipitation conditions would provide an acceptable level of safety until terminating action
could be identified and developed. 

In developing this AD action, the FAA considered all of these items, and determined that, since the continued operational
safety of the U.S. fleet could be assured during the interim, it was not impracticable to provide notice and the opportunity
for public comment on the proposed rule. 

Two commenters, the CAA and Jetstream, request that the proposed rule be revised to require establishing a life limit
on the engine igniter plugs, installing a bypass duct outlet eductor, and incorporating other changes to the airplane
flight manual (AFM), in lieu of the proposed AFM revision. The commenters contend that, if such interim measures are
taken, an acceptable level of safety would be assured pending longer term corrective action. The commenters explain
that service information has been issued that describes procedures for those actions, as follows: 

1. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-80-06, Revision 1, dated October 22, 1993, which describes procedures
for placing a life limit on the engine igniter plugs and replacing those parts at staggered periods in order to improve
ignition reliability.

<TEXT>
 

2. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-54-12-35274A, Revision 1, dated December 15, 1993, which describes
procedures for installation of an eductor plate over the exhaust port of the engine air intake system. Accomplishment
of this installation will increase the air flow rate down the exhaust port. 

3. Temporary Revision No. T/33, Issue 1, dated November 1, 1993, which revises AFM Document No. ATP 004. This temporary
revision describes revisions to the Limitations and Normal Procedures sections of the FAA-approved AFM to introduce
procedures for operation in icing conditions. The changes include a ground inspection of the engine inlet prior to
flight, staggered selection of the left- and right-hand engine de-ice systems to ensure that the likelihood of simultaneous
engine rundown on final approach is minimized, and a small increase in the final approach speed to ensure safe landing.


Jetstream also suggests two other alternatives that would provide an adequate level of safety, wherein the proposed
AFM limitation could be removed: 

1. Modification of the engine inlets, in addition to accomplishment of the interim measures discussed previously
(a life limit on the engine igniter plugs, installation of a bypass duct outlet eductor, and certain changes to the
AFM). Jetstream indicates that these modified engine inlets demonstrate a significant improvement in de-icing
effectiveness in the range of temperatures and airplane speeds in which power rollbacks have been experienced. 

Jetstream service bulletins that relate to the engine inlet modification are described as follows: Jetstream Service
Bulletin ATP-54-13-35274B, dated October 9, 1993, describes procedures for installing engine
air inlet ducts that incorporate electrical de-ice heaters with increased power and area. The service bulletin also
describes procedures for performing associated electrical system changes. The installation involves installing
engine air inlet ducts that incorporate an enlarged heater mat with revised electrical power densities adjacent
to the engine intake flange. Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-54-14, dated October 14, 1993, describes
procedures for repetitive visual inspections of the heater mats for damage, and replacement of the engine air intake,
if necessary. 

2. Accomplishment of special operating procedures, not specifically defined by the commenter. Jetstream considers
that requiring such operating procedures is a proven and acceptable means of providing an adequate level of safety,
as generally demonstrated by the operation of aircraft throughout their flight spectra, in accordance with AFM's.


Jetstream submits one final suggestion in the event the FAA proceeds with requiring the proposed operating limitation.
In this case, the commenter suggests that the actions described in Jetstream Service Bulletins ATP-54-13-35274B
and ATP-54-14, in addition to the interim measures discussed previously (a life limit on the engine igniter
plugs, installation of a bypass duct outlet eductor, and certain changes to the AFM), be accomplished as an alternative
method of compliance for the proposed operating limitation. 

The FAA concurs partially. The interim measures proposed by the CAA and Jetstream were based, to a large extent, on
the flight crew performing special operating procedures to ensure a safe landing after one or both engines had run
down due to ice ingestion. However, the FAA considers that requiring the flight crew to perform such special operating
procedures over a long term period may not provide the degree of safety assurance necessary for these airplanes. The
FAA has determined that requiring the proposed operating limitation to prohibit flight into certain meteorological
conditions known to cause engine rundown will provide an acceptable level of safety until additional hardware modifications
can be identified and installed on these airplanes. 

However, the FAA concurs with Jetstream's suggestion that the accomplishment of the interim measures and modification
of the engine inlets may be accomplished as optional terminating action for the operating limitation. Since the issuance
of the proposed rule, Jetstream has issued Temporary Revision No. T/38, Issue 1, dated February 16, 1994, which revises
certain pages of Temporary Revision No. T/33 (discussed previously). Temporary Revision No. T/38 amends the Normal
Procedures section of the AFM as related to operation of engine continuous ignition during flight in icing conditions.
The FAA finds that this new information must be included in the AFM for Model ATP airplanes in order to assure continued
reliability and to prevent unnecessary wear on engine ignition systems. 

Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to include a new paragraph (b), which includes the following optional
terminating action: 

1. Revising the Limitations section and the Normal and Abnormal Procedures sections of the FAA-approved AFM, to include
the information specified in Temporary Revision No. T/33, Issue 1, dated November 1, 1993, and Temporary Revision
No. T/38, Issue 1, dated February 16, 1994, to introduce procedures for operation in icing conditions. 

2. Revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to place a life limit on the engine igniter plugs and to replace those
parts at specified intervals in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-80-06, Revision 1, dated
October 22, 1993. 

3. Installing an eductor plate over the exhaust port of the engine air intake system in accordance with Jetstream Service
Bulletin ATP-54-12-35274A, Revision 1, dated December 15, 1993. 

4. Installing engine air inlet ducts that incorporate electrical de-ice heaters with increased power and area, and
performing associated electrical system changes, in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin ATP-54-13-35274B,
dated October 9, 1993. 

5. Revising the FAA-approved maintenance program to include repetitive visual inspections of the heater mats for
damage; and, if any damage is found, replacement of the engine air intake; in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin
ATP-54-14, dated October 14, 1993.

This is considered to be interim action until final action is identified, at which time the FAA may consider further
rulemaking. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

The FAA estimates that 9 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1 work
hour per airplane to accomplish the required AFM revision, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. The
cost for required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $495, or $55 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished
the requirements of this AD. 

Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that is provided by this AD action, the number
of work hours required to accomplish it is approximately 159 per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.
Required modification parts would be supplied by Jetstream at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD for accomplishment of the optional terminating action is $8,745 per airplane. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Model 4101 Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes,
that requires a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign objects and debris, removal of any foreign
object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat. This amendment also
requires a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program to include repetitive visual inspections of the area
above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. This
amendment is prompted by reports that foreign objects and debris have been found in the area around the elevator and
rudder trim cables below the floor. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent foreign objects and debris
from lodging in the control circuits and jamming the elevator and rudder trim systems.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 25, 1994 (59 FR 3636). That action proposed to require a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring
for foreign objects and debris, removal of any foreign object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard
on the rear cabin attendant seat. That action also proposed to require a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance
program to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris,
and removal of any foreign object or debris found. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the two comments received. 

Both commenters support the proposed rule. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $770, or $110 per airplane. 

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Pratt & Whitney Canada Model 
PT6A-67D Turboprop Engines 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing priority letter airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &
Whitney Canada (PWC) PT6A-67D turboprop engines, that currently requires inspections of the compressor turbine
(CT) disk and blades for cracking and other irregularities using visual inspections and fluorescent penetrant inspections
(FPI). That AD also requires amending the Beech Model 1900D Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and installing a placard
that alerts the pilot of this requirement. This amendment continues all the requirements of the current priority
letter AD and requires the installation of parts having an improved design including a CT stator assembly, a CT shroud
housing, CT turbine blades, feather seals, and a small exit duct assembly. This amendment is prompted by the manufacturer
developing new design improvements that will reduce the susceptibility of the CT blades to high cycle fatigue (HCF)
damage. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine failure and inflight engine shutdown due to
HCF failure of the CT blades.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding priority letter airworthiness directive
(AD) 92-27-19, which is applicable to Pratt & Whitney Canada (PWC) PT6A-67D turboprop engines,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 26, 1993 (58 FR 62296). That action proposed to retain the inspections and Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)
revisions required by the current AD, but would also require installation at the next shop visit after the effective
date of this AD, or December 31, 1994, whichever occurs first, of the improved compressor turbine (CT) turbine stator
assembly, CT shroud housing, small exit duct assembly, CT blades, and feather seals. Installation of this hardware
constitutes terminating action to the inspections required by this AD. PWC has advised the FAA that December 31, 1994,
is the earliest compliance end-date possible due to parts availability. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with PWC Service Bulletin (SB) No. 14128, Revision 3, dated April 19, 1993; PWC SB No. 14132, Revision
1, dated May 12, 1993; and PWC SB 14142, Revision 1, dated May 12, 1993. Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness
authority of Canada, classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued AD CF-92-25-R1,
dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the airworthiness of these PWC PT6A-67D engines in Canada. 



This engine model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions
of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant
to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comment received. 

The commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 

There are approximately 100 engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 87 engines
installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 40 work hours per
engine to install the improved hardware, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. PWC advises the FAA that
it will reimburse operators for the cost of labor and the cost of required parts. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be negligible.

[Amended] 



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:


 




94-10-02 Pratt & Whitney Canada: 

Amendment 39-8909 Docket 93-ANE-53.

 




Applicability: 

Pratt & Whitney Canada (PWC) Model PT6A-67D turboprop engines with serial numbers prior to 
PC-E114100, installed on but not limited to Beech Model 1900D airplanes. 



Compliance:

 Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 

To prevent engine failure and inflight engine shutdown due to high cycle fatigue (HCF) failure of the compressor turbine
(CT) blades, accomplish the following: 

(a) Prior to further flight, amend the Beech Model 1900D Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM), Part Number (P/N) 
129-590000-3, by inserting the following requirements between pages 2-4 and 2-5: 



ENGINE OPERATING LIMITATIONS 



Gas Generator RPM (N1)_Continuous operation of the gas generator between 94.0% and 97.1% is prohibited. 



Notes 



1. This limitation does not prohibit the use of N1's between 94.0% and 97.1% when the pilot in command determines that
the power setting is required for the safe operation of the airplane. If such occurrences exceed 5 minutes, the engine(s)
must be inspected in accordance with Pratt & Whitney Canada Service Bulletin No. 14128, Revision 3, dated April
19, 1993. 

2. This limitation does not prohibit the use of static Take-Off Power and Maximum Continuous Power between 94.0% and
97.1% N1 to meet the required Take-Off performance. If such occurrences exceed 5 minutes, the engine(s) must be inspected
in accordance with Pratt & Whitney Canada Service Bulletin No. 14128, Revision 3, dated April 19, 1993. 

3. Operation at 94.0% and below, and at 97.1% and above are permitted. Continuous operation at 94.1% through 97.0%
is prohibited. 

4. ``Continuous Operation'' means time periods exceeding 5 minutes.

5. High Speed Cruise Power Tables found in the Pilot's Operating Manual may produce N1's in the prohibited range. Flights
should be planned using Intermediate or Long Range Power settings. 
6. The goal of the operator should be to keep the total time of operation in the prohibited range to the absolute minimum,
since the effects of operating between N1's of 94.0% and 97.1% are cumulative.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Request for Comments on the Rule




Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the ``DATES'' section. However, after the review of
any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate rulemaking proceedings
to extend the effective date of the rule or to amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.


The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Bryant AHP, AK, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours of operation.
This action also amends Class E airspace effective hours at Gulkana, AK, to coincide with the associated flight service
station's hours of operation. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control zone
(CZ) existed at Bryant AHP and a control zone (CZ) existed at Gulkana. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective
September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them
with the designation of ``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon
the operation of the air traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation
at Bryant AHP makes it necessary to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's
hours of operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with the air
traffic control tower Bryant AHP, AK, is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach
procedures at Gulkana, AK.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify this Class D and Class E airspace area in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace area at
Lebanon, NH by amending the effective hours of that area to coincide with the hours of operation of the associated air

Springfield/Chicopee, MA by amending the effective hours of that area to coincide with the hours of operation to the
associated air traffic control tower (ATCT). This action also establishes Class E airspace at Springfield/Chicopee,
MA when the associated ATCT is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and a control
zone (CZ) existed at this airport. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, discontinued
the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation ``Class D
airspace.'' The former CZ was effective on a continuous basis, while the former ATA was contingent upon the hours of
operation of the ATCT. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single Class D airspace designation made it necessary
to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the hours of operation of the ATCT. Class E airspace
in the vicinity of Springfield/Chicopee, MA is necessary for aircraft executing instrument approaches to that airport
during times when ATCT is not in operation. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication
with the Springfield/Chicopee ATCT is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing instrument
approach procedures to that airport when the ATCT is closed. 

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify the Springfield/Chicopee Class D airspace and establish Class E airspace
in the vicinity of Springfield/Chicopee, MA in order to promote the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these
areas. Therefore, I find that notice and an opportunity for prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable
and contrary to the public interest. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes a Class E airspace area at New Haven, CT. At present this area is designated as Class D airspace
during the time when the New Haven air traffic control tower (ATCT) is in operation. A need for controlled airspace
at New Haven continues, however, after the ATCT closes. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class
E airspace for aircraft conducting instrument flight rules (IFR) operations when the ATCT is closed.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Comments Invited



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the 

DATES

 section. However, after review of the comments and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will initiate
rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes a Class E airspace area at
New Haven, CT. At present, this area is designated as Class D airspace during the time when the New Haven air traffic
control tower (ATCT) is in operation. A need for controlled airspace at New Haven continues, however, after the ATCT
closes to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) when
the ATCT is closed. As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time ATCT should be designated as Class D airspace when the
ATCT is in operation, and as Class E airspace at other times. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate
Class E airspace for aircraft conducting IFR operations when the ATCT is closed.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designated as surface
areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to establish Class E airspace in the vicinity of New Haven, CT, in order to promote the
safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and an opportunity for prior
public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies

the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Revocation of Class E airspace; Thomaston, GA

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revokes the Class E airspace that extends upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Thomaston, GA.
The Reginald Grant Non Directional Beacon (NDB) was decommissioned on February 11, 1994. The standard instrument
approach procedure (SIAP) based on the NDB will be cancelled. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet
above the surface will no longer be needed to contain Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Thomaston, GA. The
operating status of the airport will change from IFR operations to VFR operations concurrent with decommissioning
of the NDB.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation revokes the 700 foot Class E airspace area at Thomaston,
GA. The Thomaston City Government advised the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its decision to decommission
the Reginald Grant NDB effective February 11, 1994. The FAA will cancel the Standard Instrument Approach based on
the Reginald Grant NDB. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above the surface will no longer be needed
to contain IFR operations at Thomaston, GA. In addition, the operating status of the Reginald Grant Airport is changed
from IFR operations to VFR operations concurrent with the decommissioning of the Reginald Grant NDB.

Since this action merely involves the revocation of Class E airspace area, as a result of the removal of a navigation
aid by the Thomaston City Government, notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessary. Additionally,
since there will no longer be a SIAP at Thomaston, Georgia, Reginald Grant Airport, the Class E airspace area must be
removed to avoid confusion on the part of the pilots flying in the vicinity of the Reginald Grant Airport and to promote
safe and efficient handling of air traffic in the area. Therefore, I find that good cause exists, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
553(d), for making this amendment effective in less than thirty days.

Designations for Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface are published in Paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1, effective September 16, 1993. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be removed
subsequently from the Order.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 Bureau of Export Administration, Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is amending the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by revising certain
entries in Categories 3, 4, and 5 of the Commerce Control List 
(CCL) to conform with changes made to the International Industrial List (IL) before the dissolution of the Coordinating

Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) on March 31, 1994. The COCOM changes require certain conforming
revisions to General License GLX. A policy decision on foreign availability of telecommunications is announced.




This rule also revises the countries that are included in Country Groups V, W, and Y and amends the special country policies
provisions in the EAR to reflect the changes in licensing policy for the countries that have been moved from one country
group to another. 

This rule amends the documentation requirements provisions of the EAR to substitute the Form BXA-629P (Statement
by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser) for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement. Finally, this rule amends
the documentation requirements provisions in the EAR to implement Import Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV)
procedures for Bulgaria and Romania. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



This final rule revises new General License GLX (59 FR 15621) to resolve certain ambiguities and to reflect changes
in national security controls. For instance, Supplement No. 1 to part 771 is revised to delete 4A03.c and 4A03.b because
the paragraph references are now incorrect and new Administrative Exception Notes make listing on the Supplement
unnecessary. 

This rule amends a number of ECCNs in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to conform with recent changes in the COCOM International
Industrial List (IL). ECCN 3A01.a.3 is revised to control ``microprocessor microcircuits'', ``microcomputer
microcircuits'', and microcontroller microcircuits that:

(1) Have an arithmetic logic unit with an access width of 32 bit or more and a ``composite theoretical performance''
(``CTP'') of 
80 million theoretical operations per second (Mtops) or more; 
(2) are manufactured from a compound semiconductor and operate at a clock frequency exceeding 40 MHz; or (3) have more
than one data or instruction bus or serial communication port for external interconnection in a parallel processor
with a transfer rate exceeding 2.5 Mbyte/s. ECCN 3A01.e.1 is revised to indicate that it does not control batteries
with volumes equal to or less than 27 cm

3

 (e.g., standard C-cells or R-14 batteries). 

This rule also revises ECCN 3C03A to control organo-arsenic, organo-antimony, and organo-phosphorus compounds
having a purity (inorganic element basis) better than 99.999%. In addition, a Note is added to 3C03A indicating that
the entry controls only those compounds whose metallic, partly metallic or non-metallic element is directly linked
to carbon in the organic part of the molecule. 

This rule removes specific control language in ECCN 4A03A applicable to: (1) Disk drives and solid state storage equipment
and input/output control units designed for use with such equipment and (2) color displays and monitors. 

ECCN 4A03A retains specific control parameters for ``assemblies'' and graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors.
ECCN 4A03A controls: (1) ``assemblies'' that are specially designed or modified to be capable of enhancing performance
by aggregation of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') so that the ``CTP'' of the aggregation exceeds 260 Mtops and (2)
graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors exceeding a ``3-D Vector Rate'' of 1,600,000. 

The following changes are made in the Notes for Category 4: 
(1) Advisory Notes 1 and 2 are revised to conform with the new paragraph designations in ECCN 4A03A (there are no changes
in the administrative exceptions levels); (2) Advisory Note 3 is revised by establishing new administrative exceptions
treatment levels for exports to Country Groups Q, W, and Y and the People's Republic of China for ``digital computers''
(a ``CTP'' not exceeding 1,000 Mtops), graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors 
(a ``3-D vector rate'' not exceeding 3 million) and equipment specially designed to provide for the external
interconnection of ``digital computers'' or associated equipment (a total data transfer rate not exceeding 400
MByte/second); (3) Advisory Note 4 is removed and reserved because 4A03A no longer contains control parameters that
apply specifically to disk drives and input/output control units therefor; (4) Advisory Note 6 is revised by establishing
new favorable consideration levels for Country Groups Q, W, and Y and the People's Republic of China for ``digital''
computers (a ``CTP'' not exceeding 1,500 Mtops) and for graphics accelerators or graphics coprocessors and equipment
specially designed to provide for the external interconnection of ``digital'' computers; (5) Advisory Note 7 is
revised to conform with the new paragraph designations in ECCN 4A03A (there are no changes in the favorable consideration
levels), and (8) a new Advisory Note 8 is added to provide administrative exceptions treatment for equipment controlled
by 4A03.g that is exported for use in interconnecting peripheral equipment to ``digital computers'' 

not

 controlled by 4A03.b. 

In the telecommunications section of Category 5, ECCN 5A02A is revised to control modems using the ``bandwidth of
one voice channel'' with a ``data signalling rate'' exceeding 28,800 bit/s. Previously, ECCN 5A02A controlled modems
exceeding 19,200 bit/s. On January 13, 1994, BXA published a determination that foreign availability exists within
the meaning of the Export Administration Act (EAA) for certain telecommunications equipment controlled under ECCN
5A02.a to Country Groups Q, W, Y, Z, and the People's Republic of China (59 FR 1924). The determination applies to telecommunications
transmission equipment employing digital techniques, including digital processing of analog signals, and designed
to operate at digital transfer rates up to 623 Mbit/s. 

The determination notice specified that the Administration would enter into negotiations to preserve national
security interests concerning this equipment. The Administration intends to negotiate to remove foreign availability
of this high technology equipment to military end-users in Country Groups Q, W, Y, and the People's Republic of China.


It has been determined that the validated license requirement is retained on telecommunications equipment controlled
by ECCN 5A02.a to military end-users and for military end-uses in Country Groups Q, W, Y and the People's Republic of
China, consistent with EAA section 5(c)(6), to allow meaningful negotiations to take place. Section 5(c)(6) permits
the Secretary of Commerce to maintain controls, notwithstanding foreign availability, for an initial period of
six months. For purposes of this control, military end-users and end-uses include conventional military activities
and all proliferation activities described in Part 778 of this subchapter. 

This action does not affect the control status of this equipment to other end-users or destinations. General License
GLX continues to be available for shipments of equipment controlled by ECCN 5A02, except 5A02.h and .i, to civilian
end-users and for civilian end-uses in Country Groups QWY and the PRC. In addition, all of ECCN 5A02 remains eligible
for General License GFW to Country Groups T & V, except Iran, Syria, and the PRC. Foreign policy controls are retained
on all items controlled by ECCN 5A02 to Country Groups S and Z, Iran and Syria, and the South African military and police.
Exporters are also reminded that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control maintains prohibitions
on exports to Iraq, Haiti, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 

In the Notes for Telecommunications in Category 5, Advisory 
Notes 1, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 19 are revised, and new Advisory Notes 23 through 27 are added. Advisory Note
8 is revised to provide administrative exceptions treatment to the People's Republic of China for test, inspection,
and production equipment controlled by 5B01A or 5B02A and ``software'' and technology for such equipment. Advisory
Notes 11, 12, and 13 are revised to restrict their application to Albania, Bulgaria, the 
People's Republic of China, Mongolia, Romania, and Vietnam. Advisory Notes 14 and 17 are revised to clarify which
parties are responsible for the supervision of controlled spare parts.

Advisory Note 15 is revised to restrict its application to Bulgaria and Romania. Advisory Note 16 is revised to restrict
its application to Albania, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Romania, and Vietnam. Advisory Note 19 is revised by removing references
to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Notes 25 and 27 are added. 
This rule revises the country policy provisions in  785.2 to conform with changes in licensing policies for
proscribed countries. This rule also moves Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic from Country Group
W to Country Group V. As a result of this change, Poland and the Czech and Slovak Republics are now eligible for exports
under certain special license procedures (e.g., the Distribution License Procedure) and general licenses (e.g.,
General License GFW). 
This rule also amends the EAR to include new supporting document requirements based on the implementation of Import
Certificate/Delivery Verification (IC/DV) procedures for Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgarian and Romanian ICs and
DVs are issued by the respective Ministries of Trade in each country. Supplement No. 1 to Part 775 is amended to add the
addresses of these issuing agencies. 
This rule also amends Supplement No. 1 to Part 775 by revising the name of the agency that issues Indian Import Certificates
to small scale industries and entities. 
On January 2, 1992 (57 FR 8), the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) published a final rule clarifying that the geographical
area formerly known as the Soviet Union remained a controlled destination as listed in Country Group Y. That rule allowed

exporters to use the designation ``Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'', ``Soviet Union'', or ``USSR'' on export
control documents involving that geographic area until new political entities were identified. This final rule
revises Supplement No. 1 to part 770, Supplement No. 5 to part 778, and  785.2(a)(1) to include a listing of the
states located in the geographic area of the former Soviet Union. These new designations should be used on all export
control documents. 
The dissolution of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Yugoslavia) has raised questions among
exporters concerning the export control requirements for that geographic area. The geographic area formerly known
as Yugoslavia continues to fall within Country Group V. At this time, the provisions of the EAR that apply to this area
remain unchanged, except that this rule revises the documentation requirements to substitute a Form BXA-629P,
Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser, for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement. In addition,
this rule eliminates the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate requirement for exports/reexports under the Distribution
License and the Service Supply Procedure. 
The Consignee/Purchaser Statement procedure set forth in  775.2 provides a broader range of exemptions than
was previously available under  775.5 for the Yugoslav End-Use Certificate. 
Finally, this rule revises  776.10(a)(2) to make the special documentation requirements for exports to Country
Groups QWY and the People's Republic of China of electronic computers and related equipment conform with the revisions
made by this rule in the Advisory Notes for Category 4. 



Rulemaking Requirements

2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694-0002,
0694-0005, 0694-0007, 0694-0008, 0694-0010, 0694-0013, 0694-0015, 0694-0017,
0694-0021, 0694-0073, and 0694-0078. 
3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612. 
4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has
to be or will be prepared. 
5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation
involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice
of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. 
Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on
this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Sharron Cook, Office of Technology
and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.

(a)(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA) states that it is the policy of the United States to encourage
trade with all countries with which we have diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such
trade has been determined by the President to be against the national interest. The Act also states that it is the policy
of the United States to restrict the export of goods and technical data that would make a significant contribution
to the military potential of any other country or combination of countries that would prove detrimental to the national
security of the United States. Accordingly, and in compliance with the other sections of the EAA, the Department conducts
a continuing review of commodities and technical data to assure that prior approval is required for the export or reexport
of U.S.-origin commodities and technical data to Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Russia, Romania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine,
Uzbekistan and Vietnam only if the commodities or technical data have a potential for being used in a manner that would
prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. The general policy of the Department is to approve
applications or requests to export or reexport such commodities and technical data to these destinations when the
Department determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the commodities or technical data are for civilian use or would
otherwise not make a significant contribution to the military potential of the country of destination that would
prove detrimental to the national security of the United States. However, in recognition of efforts made to adopt
safeguard measures for exports, Bulgaria, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mongolia, and Russia are accorded enhanced
favorable consideration licensing treatment. 


* * * * * 


(b) See parts 776 and 778 of this subchapter for foreign policy based controls governing exports to Country Groups
Q, W, and Y. 
(c) 

Country Group Q.

 Romania (Country Group Q) has been determined to present a lesser strategic threat, and has adopted safeguard measures
to protect against the diversion of national security controlled items. In recognition of these facts, the Commerce
Control List includes several Advisory Notes that indicate likelihood of approval or favorable consideration for
export to satisfactory end-users in Country Group Q. Items not eligible for favorable consideration will be reviewed
on a case-by-case basis.

Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Foreign Service of the United States



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Consular Affairs, Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim rule amends  22.1 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations by creating a surcharge for the processing
of machine readable visas (MRV's). That surcharge, pursuant to OMB Circular No. A-25, is set at a cost-recovery
based level of $20,00 per visa application.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION





Background



Public Law 103-236, enacted April 30, 1994, authorizes the Secretary of State to collect a surcharge for the
processing of machine readable visa (MRV) applications, and to retain the resulting revenues, up to a ceiling of $107.5
million for fiscal years 1994 and 1995. This authority has been delegated to the Under Secretary for Management. It
supplements and in part overrides section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) which generally provides
for nonimmigrant visa fees to be set on the basis of reciprocity.

The Secretary of State has also been authorized under E.O. 10718 of June 27, 1957, to exercise the President's authority
under 22 U.S.C. 4219 to prescribe rates of fees to be charged for official services performed by the Department of State.
Under this authority, the Department has determined a number of fees for consular services performed overseas, as
well as in the United States, within the guidelines set by OMB Circular No. A-25. The policy set out in Circular
A-25 states that services which directly benefit individuals, organizations, or groups should be paid for
by the users rather than the taxpayers. Services performed for the primary benefit of the general public or the U.S.
Government are to be supported by tax revenues. The principles of Circular A-25 have guided various fee studies
conducted by the Department. As a result, although the authority to charge for processing a machine readable visa
is new, the Department has for a number of years had on hand Circular A-25-based cost estimates for visa processing.

In the Department's latest consular fee study, issued in January 1991, the cost of processing a nonimmigrant visa
was determined to be $18.47. Equipment used to process machine readable nonimmigrant visas (MRV's) is considerably
more expensive than the equipment used to issue the outdated stamped visas which the MRV is replacing. Given these
additional equipment costs and the costs of collecting the fee, the new fee has been set at a cost-recovery level of
$20.00 per visa application. This fee may in fact be below cost, but the Department believes that it is an approximate
level at which to set the charge initially, given the base estimate of $18.47 and the need for a fee that can be collected
with minimal transaction costs. A $20.00 fee is a whole dollar amount. Moreover, in discussing the new fee with members
of Congress, $20.00 was discussed in light of the 1991 cost study as the initial amount at which the new fee would be set.

The implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation comments, is based upon
the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3). The authorization for the collection of a
processing fee for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combination border crossing card mandated
by Public Law 103-236 took effect on April 30, 1994. This rule must take effect upon publication to ensure that
the Department maximizes surcharge revenue for the balance of fiscal year 1994. The Department will be relying on
such revenues to fund accelerated installation of improved visa processing and issuing technology at consular posts.
The installation of such technology has become a high priority for the United States in light of the World Trade Center
bombing and increasing concerns about visa fraud and alien terrorist activity in the United States.

This rule is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291 nor is it expected to have a significant impact

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Consular Affairs, DOS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule adds a surcharge provision to part 41 title 22, Code of Federal Regulations. The amendment to the regulations
authorizes the Secretary of State, pursuant to the provisions of section 140 of Public Law 103-236, to collect
a surcharge for processing applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined
border crossing cards. This surcharge is herein referred to as the ``MRV surcharge''. The authority vested in the
Secretary of State mandates appropriate amendments to the nonimmigrant regulations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 30, 1994, the President signed into law Public Law 103-236, State Department Authorization Bill for
Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995. The provisions of section 140 of this law grant the Secretary of State the authority to collect
a surcharge for the processing of applications of machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined
border crossing cards. Such authority is new and requires appropriate amendment of the visa regulations at 22 CFR
41.107. 



Current Authority 



Section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) provides that the Secretary of State shall establish fees
for the issuance of nonimmigrant visas based upon reciprocity. Pursuant to this section of law, the Secretary of State
where practicable prescribes a fee to be imposed upon nationals of a foreign country that corresponds with all the
visa related costs charged U.S. citizens by that foreign country. The Department's implementing regulation, at
22 CFR 41.107(a), restates the statutory principle authorizing the Secretary of State to collect nonimmigrant visa
issuance fees based on reciprocity. As a reciprocal charge, the fee prescribed by the Secretary reflects the total
costs imposed by a foreign state on U.S. nationals. If no costs are incurred, no fee is prescribed. The fees collected
pursuant to section 281 are remitted to the general funds of the U.S. Treasury. 



MRV Surcharge 



Section 140 of the State Department Authorization Bill authorizes a surcharge to be imposed for machine readable
visas and border crossing cards notwithstanding INA 281 and the regulations at  41.107. This new fee may, therefore,
be charged for processing applications for machine readable visas, independent of fees prescribed pursuant to reciprocity
under the provisions of section 281 of the Act. Moreover, surcharges collected pursuant to section 140 may be retained
by the Department up to $107 million for FY 94 and FY 95 combined. 

The regulation at section 41.107 is being amended to authorize the collection of this surcharge separate from and
in addition to any other fee. The amount of the surcharge and justification for that amount are subjects of a separate
regulation being promulgated by the Under Secretary of State for Management. 



Interim Rule 



In order to implement the provisions of section 140, Public Law 103-236, the regulation at  41.107 is being
amended to authorize the Secretary of State to collect the surcharge, separate from or independent from and in addition
to any other fee, for processing applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combined
border crossing identification cards and nonimmigrant visas. 

The implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation comments, is based upon
the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3). The authorization for the collection of a
processing fee for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and machine readable combination border crossing cards
mandated by Public Law 103-236 takes effect on April 30, 1994. This rule must take effect upon publication to
ensure that the Department maximizes surcharge revenues for the balance of FY-94. The Department will be relying
on such revenues to fund accelerated installation of an imposed visa processing and issuing technology at consular
posts. The installation of such technology has become a high priority for the United States in light of the World Trade
Center bombing and increasing concern about visa fraud and alien terrorist activity in the United States. This rule
is not considered to be a major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291; nor is it expected to have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this rule does not impose
information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. This rule has been
reviewed as required by E.O. 12778 and certified to be in compliance therewith. This rule is exempt from review under
E.O. 12866, but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the objectives thereof.

In addition to the collection of the fee prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, a consular officer shall collect
or ensure the collection of a surcharge for the processing of applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas
and for machine readable combined border crossing cards in the amount specified by the Secretary of State from such
applicants as the Secretary of State shall designate. Such surcharge is refundable only if, as a result of action taken
by the U.S. Goverment for which the alien was not responsible and over which the alien had no control, the alien's application
is not processed.

Removal of Obsolete and Redundant Right-of-Way Requirements 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation (DOT). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule eliminates a number of FHWA prior approvals previously required in the acquisition of real property
for Federal-aid highway projects. Consistent with the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991
(ISTEA), this approach reduces the regulatory burden for States and encourages greater flexibility by reducing
the degree to which the FHWA will be involved in the development of Federal-aid highway projects. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule modifies several provisions in the FHWA's right-of-way regulations that require the FHWA to grant
prior approvals or authorizations for particular actions by a State. These case-by-case approvals will no longer
be required and will be replaced by a one-time FHWA approval of State procedures. Oversight by the FHWA will continue
through the use of process reviews. In the future, prior approvals may be reinstituted if they are found to be necessary
to protect the Federal investment. 


As a result of a review of the FHWA's right-of-way regulations, the Office of Right-of-Way identified a number of requirements
that imposed burdens on States without commensurate program benefit. The review disclosed a number of case-by-case
approval actions that, based on experience, were no longer necessary to protect the investment of Federal-aid highway
funds. These approval actions are divided into the two categories set forth below. 
The first category includes six FHWA approvals or authorizations. The State may now take the approval or authorization
actions required by the following sections if they are in accordance with procedures that have been approved by the
FHWA. 





The second category includes four FHWA approvals that are eliminated on all FHWA-funded projects except those on
the National Highway System (NHS). These concern the long-term use or disposal of rights-of-way and are no longer
considered necessary or useful on a case-by-case basis for non-NHS projects. The FHWA will continue case-by-case
approvals or authorizations relating to the use or disposal of NHS rights-of-way, consistent with the provisions
of 23 U.S.C. 106(b)(2) which require that a higher level of FHWA oversight be maintained on the NHS. 
Accordingly, the authorization actions required by the following sections may be taken by the State if they are in
accordance with procedures that have been approved by the FHWA, except with regard to facilities or projects that
are on the National Highway System (NHS), described in 23 U.S.C. 103. The FHWA approvals or authorizations that are
prescribed by the following sections continue to be required with regard to facilities or projects on the NHS because
of FHWA's special interest in the integrity and safety of NHS facilities and right-of-way. 






On July 21, 1993, the FHWA published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) concerning the above provisions of FHWA's right-of-way regulations (58 FR
38987). The FHWA received three comments on the NPRM, all from State Departments of Transportation. All three commenters
supported in varying degrees the proposed changes. Two commenters indicated that the proposed changes would increase
their flexibility or simplify their right-of-way programs. The third anticipated a slight decrease in paperwork
and a subsequent saving of time. 
We received no negative comments. Furthermore, none of the three commenters suggested any changes in the language
of the NPRM. Accordingly, the language of the final rule is unchanged from that proposed in the NPRM. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It
is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal. The rulemaking would not affect the level
of funding available in Federal or federally-assisted programs covered by the Uniform Relocation and Real Property
Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4610 

et seq.

), or otherwise have a significant economic impact; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 
5 U.S.C. 601-612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation,
the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities since it will make relatively small changes in existing regulatory provisions by eliminating certain FHWA
prior approvals. 


Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a federalism assessment. This action, in effect, both clarifies and simplifies current regulatory requirements.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone at Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This safety zone is needed
to protect the Whitbread Round the World Race participant vessels from safety hazards associated with the spectator
vessels operating in the area of the Whitbread/Heineken Trophy Village at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port, Miami, Florida, or his designated
representative.




FOR OTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

 LT Robert G. Garrott, Port Operations Department, USCG Marine Safety Office, 51 SW. First Avenue, Miami, Florida
33130 (305) 536-5693.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication.


Drafting Information


The drafters of this regulation are Lieutenant Robert G. Garrott, Project Officer for the Captain of the Port, Miami,
Florida, and Lieutenant Jacqueline M. Losego, Project Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Discussion of Regulations


The event requiring this regulation to be established is the presence of the Whitbread Round the World Race participant
vessels at the Whitbread/Heineken Trophy Village. The Trophy Village is located within Port Everglades on the west
side of the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway with its easternmost limits marked by NO WAKE signs. There are significant
risks associated with spectator vessels operating in close proximity to the participant vessels. This regulation
is issued pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 191 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165.


Federalism


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule making does not have sufficient Federalism implication to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environmental Assessment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B and the establishment of safety zones has been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will only be in effect for such a small area that it is not expected
to have a significant impact on any commercial navigation.

Disease Subject To Presumptive Service Connection (Cancer of the Urinary Tract) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service
connection for certain diseases resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation during military service. Congress
has added cancer of the urinary tract to the list of radiogenic conditions for which presumptive service connection
is authorized, but did not indicate which entities it considers part of the urinary tract. This amendment is intended
to define the term ``urinary tract'' for VA purposes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 5, 1993 (58 FR 51798-99) a proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.309(d) to define the term ``urinary tract''
for purposes of implementing the presumption of service connection for urinary tract cancers based on exposure to
ionizing radiation established in the Radiation Exposure Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-578. Interested
parties were invited to submit written comments on or before November 4, 1993. Since no comments were received on the
proposed rule, the final rule is adopted as proposed, effective October 1, 1992, the date provided by Public Law 102-578.



The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.




The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.104 and 64.109.

Returned and Canceled Checks



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning returned and canceled checks. The
amendment will assure that the regulations clearly reflect the requirements of the governing statutes as interpreted
in a precedent opinion of VA's General Counsel. The intended effect of the amendment is to ensure that the amount represented
by a benefit check received but unnegotiated prior to a beneficiary's death is properly distributed.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.1003 in the 

Federal Register

 of September 3, 1993 (58 FR 46920-21). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before
October 4, 1993. No comments were received, and the amendments are adopted as proposed with the exception of the following
technical amendment. Section 3.1003(a), as here amended, will provide that the amount represented by a returned
and canceled check will be payable to the living person or persons in the order of precedence listed in  3.1000(a)(1)-(4),
which deals with accrued benefits. Section 3.1000(a)(4) provides, in effect, that, where there is no living person
in the classes identified in  3.1000(a)(1)-(3), the amount of accrued benefits payable is limited to
the amount necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial. We are adding to  3.1003(a),
as originally proposed, a similar statement to ensure that there is no confusion on the amount of a returned and canceled
check that may be paid in such a situation.




The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial
and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.

There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Maryland Small Business Stationary Source Technical
Environmental Compliance Assistance Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.
 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Maryland for the purpose of establishing
a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM). This
SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (``CAA'' or ``the Act'')
which lists specific program criteria to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and
regulatory information necessary to comply with CAA. The rationale for EPA's approval is set forth in this document;
additional information is available at the address indicated below. This action is being taken in accordance with
CAA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background
 


Implementation of the provisions of CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses so that
areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics.
Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations
and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements
on small businesses, section 507 of CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and
Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved
SIP. In addition, section 507 of CAA directs EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report to
Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title
V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions, and as a tool to provide
further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
 
On November 13, 1992, the State of Maryland submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section
507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1)
The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small
business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of CAA; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory
Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP and the state Small Business Ombudsman.




II. Analysis



1. Small Business Assistance Program



Sections 1-402, 1-404 and 2-201 of the Code of Maryland authorizes the Secretary of the Maryland
Department of the Environment (MDE) to establish a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program which meets the requirements of section 507 of CAA. In developing Maryland's PROGRAM
submittal, the Secretary of MDE has delegated the majority of its functions to the Department of the Environment,
Air Management Administration (AMA) which will establish a small business assistance office. 

Section 507(a) of CAA sets forth seven requirements that states must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Six requirements
will be discussed in this section of this document, while the seventh requirement, establishment of a state Small
Business Ombudsman, will be discussed in the next section. 

The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with CAA. The second requirement is
to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and
accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. 

The State has met these first two requirements by charging the AMA SBAP with the responsibility of serving as a clearinghouse
for information related to compliance methods and control technologies, pollution prevention and accidental release
prevention and detection. Information on pollution prevention/accidental release will focus on the requirements
under the accidental release provisions of title III of CAA, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) process safety standards, using the Pollution
Prevention Information Clearinghouse (PPIC) and the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office (CEPPO)
as resources. Relevant clearinghouse material will be translated into layman's terms and organized into information
packets. The AMA will also use as resources EPA's Control Technology Center (CTC), Emissions Measurement Technical
Information Center (EMTIC), as well as other state organizations, such as the University of Maryland's Technology
Extension Service. The AMA will work closely with other state agencies, particularly the Maryland Department of
Economic and Employment Development (DEED) to optimize information exchange and program effectiveness. Information
dissemination shall take two forms. The proactive portion of the program (Information Outreach Network) will utilize
industry groups, trade associations, Maryland's Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and additional avenues
as needed to disseminate information to eligible small business stationary sources. The AMA will also disseminate
information in a reactive manner by establishing an Information Clearinghouse, via a toll-free telephone hotline,
which will be responsible for answering questions directly or referring such questions to appropriate agency experts.


The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under CAA
in a timely and efficient manner. The AMA has met this requirement by planning to develop pamphlets and information
packets, as well as sponsoring seminars detailing general permit requirements, new and existing regulatory requirements
and methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection. These informational packages
will be disseminated in a timely manner by the Information Outreach Network described in the preceding paragraph.
Specific questions about permitting responsibilities and procedures will be directed to appropriate experts in
the AMA. 

The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
CAA. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of
their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the
option of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with CAA. The AMA
has met these requirements by planning to maintain a database of all small business stationary sources and small business
membership groups subject to Federal and/or state requirements and notify these sources, in a timely manner by the
proactive mechanisms described above, of rights and obligations under CAA. In support of said PROGRAM, the AMA will
also conduct periodic surveys, to solicit feedback from the small business community. In addition, the AMA will provide
material, through the Information Outreach Network and the Information Clearinghouse, on environmental auditors
to assist small businesses in meeting the requirements of CAA. AMA staff will also be available to provide limited
on-site assistance. 

The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practices or compliance methods. The AMA will meet this requirement by establishing a
mechanism in accordance with section 507(a)(7) of CAA to receive, review and process requests for work practice,
compliance method or milestone modifications.



2. Ombudsman



Section 507(a)(3) of CAA requires the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. Maryland's Secretary of the Department of the Environment has designated the Office of Community Assistance
to serve as Ombudsman for small business concerns as they relate to the SBAP. The Office of Community Assistance presently
coordinates the Department outreach activities, and serves a problem mediation function for private citizens,
industry, and local organizations, etc. The Ombudsman will be readily accessible to small businesses and, on their
behalf, be authorized to provide reports to and communicate with state air pollution control authorities and the
Secretary of the Department of the Environment. It is anticipated that the Ombudsman's office will be adequately
staffed and funded to fulfill its function with existing personnel.




3. Compliance Advisory Panel



Section 507(e) of CAA requires the state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (the CAP) that must include two members
selected by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected
by the state legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head
of the agency in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the
Governor of the State of Maryland, through an executive order to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. The Panel
will include seven members who will be chosen consistent with the requirements of section 507(e) of the CAA.

In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, CAA delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(A) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (B) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources
is easily understandable; (C) to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP;
and (D) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction
Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. (Section 507(e)(1)(B) requires the CAP
to report on the compliance of the SBAP with these three statutes. However, since state agencies are not required to
comply with them, EPA believes that the state PROGRAM must merely require the CAP to report on whether the SBAP is adhering
to the general principles of these Federal Statutes.) 

Upon review of the November 13, 1992 formal SIP revision submittal EPA has determined that Maryland specifically
satisfies these requirements. Section 4.0 of the SIP revision states that: (1) The CAP will render advisory opinions
concerning measures to enhance the effectiveness of the program; (2) prepare periodic reports to the EPA on compliance
status of the program with the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Equal Access
to Justice Act; and (3) review information directed to small businesses stationary sources to assure such information
is understandable to the layperson. The SBAP will serve as the Secretariat for the development and dissemination
of Panel reports and advisory opinions. 

The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the Governor of the State of Maryland, through an executive order
to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. If the executive order for the establishment of the Compliance Advisory
Panel is not issued by September 1, 1994, the EPA will issue a SIP call, pursuant to 110(k)(5), to ensure its timely issuance.



4. Eligibility



Section 507(c)(1) of CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 

Except for source categories which the EPA Administrator or the State of Maryland determines (in accordance with
sections 507(c)(3)(A) and (B)), to have sufficient financial and technical capabilities to meet the requirements
of the Act without PROGRAM assistance, all small business stationary sources located in Maryland will be eligible
to receive assistance under the PROGRAM. Maryland's PROGRAM criteria for defining a ``small business stationary
source'' is equivalent to the criteria listed in section 507(c)(1) of CAA. The State of Maryland has not provided for
the extension of eligibility for assistance under the PROGRAM beyond the requirements of sections 507(c)(1)(C)-(E).
However, the State may provide ``unofficial'' program assistance to any source that requests help if resources are
available. 



III. Summary of SIP Revision



The State of Maryland has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the PROGRAM elements required by section 507
of CAA. The Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) will be administered by the Maryland Department of the Environment
(MDE), Air and Radiation Management Administration. Program implementation will begin no later than November 15,
1994. The Compliance Advisory Panel will be established by the Governor of the State of Maryland through an executive
order to be issued no later than September 1, 1994. The Panel will be appointed by no later than November 15, 1994. By
this action, EPA is hereby approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Maryland. Accordingly,  52.1110
is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart V in order to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part
of the Maryland SIP. 

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective July 15, 1994 unless, by June 15, 1994, notice is
received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn
before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw the
final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment
period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on July 15, 1994.



IV. Final Action



The Agency has reviewed Maryland's request for revision of its federally-approved SIP and found it to be in conformance
with CAA, including sections 507 and 110(a)(2)(E) thereof. EPA is approving Maryland's plan for the establishment
of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly,
 52.1110 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart V-Maryland to reflect EPA's approval action. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a economic impact on any small entities affected.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866,
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
 Under section 307(b)(1) of CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action to approve the Maryland Small Business
Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by [Insert date 60 days from date of publication]. Filing a petition for
reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce
its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans; Oregon



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving the revisions to the State of Oregon Implementation Plan (SIP) which were submitted on February 4,
1994 by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ). These revisions to OAR Chapter 340 Division 34 (Residential
Woodheating and the Woodstove Certification Program) eliminate the State's independent Woodstove Certification
program. The State instead will rely on the Federal woodstove certification program which is fully equivalent to
Oregon's woodstove certification requirements. The revisions also eliminate Oregon's requirement for separate
efficiency testing and labeling. The elimination of the State Certification Program will eliminate the duplication
of program efforts between the Federal program and the State program.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


EPA first established a Federal New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for New Residential Wood Heaters February
26, 1988. (53 FR 5873) codified at 40 CFR part 60, subpart AAA. Oregon's Woodstove Certification Rules were first approved
by EPA on August 2, 1985 (50 FR 31368) prior to promulgation of the NSPS. On November 15, 1991 revisions to the Woodstove
Certification Rules were submitted by ODEQ that included renumbering, a new requirement for temporary labeling
for overall efficiency, and provisions prohibiting the sale of used non- certified woodstoves. By these revisions,
ODEQ also retained its laboratory efficiency accreditation requirement as well as its overall retail enforcement
authority. These revisions were approved by EPA on June 9, 1992 (57 FR 24373). 
The current SIP approved Woodstove Certification rules (OAR 340-34-005 through 115) require the ODEQ
to maintain a woodstove certification program separate from the Federal Woodstove Certification Program. Moreover,
Oregon's program requires the testing and labeling of a woodstove's heating efficiency. EPA's NSPS does not have
this requirement. By approving the revision to the State of Oregon's Air Quality Control Plan Volume 2, Oregon would
eliminate the requirement for separate efficiency testing and labeling and accept the Federal Woodstove Certification
Program. 
This revision was adopted by the Oregon Environmental Quality Commission on December 10, 1993 and submitted to EPA
by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality on February 4, 1994. The woodstove provisions are intended to reduce
particulate emissions statewide. However, by eliminating the state testing and labeling of heating efficiency,
no reduction in the amount of environmental protection will be lost since there is not an efficiency standard that
must be met. The Federal woodstove emission standard is as stringent as the Oregon standard for catalytic woodstoves,
and is more stringent than the Oregon emission standard for noncatalytic woodstoves. Therefore, by the state deferring
to the Federal certification program, the amount of environmental protection would in no way be reduced. 


II. EPA Action


EPA is approving the revisions to Division 34 Residential Woodheating and Woodstove Certification Program (OAR
340-34-005 through 115). The revision includes the adoption of the rule OAR 340-34-45 into
the SIP. The revision also includes the repeal of OAR 340-34-55, OAR 340-34-65 as well as OAR
340-34-075 through 340-34-115.


III. Administrative Review 


This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.
The public should be advised that this action will be effective on July 15, 1994. However, if notice is received by June
15, 1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments on any or all of these revisions approved herein,
the action on these revisions will be withdrawn and two subsequent documents will be published before the effective
date. One document will withdraw the final action on those revisions and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing
a proposal of the action on these revisions and establish a comment period. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 15, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2).

Implementation of Section 17 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992; Compatibility
Between Cable Systems and Consumer Electronics Equipment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has adopted rules for assuring compatibility between consumer electronics equipment and cable systems,
as required by the Section 17 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. These new rules
are intended to ensure compatibility between consumer equipment and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent
theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefits of both the programming available
on cable systems and the functions available on their television receivers and video cassette recorders (VCRs).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's First Report and Order in ET Docket No. 93-7, FCC 93-495, adopted April
4, 1994 and released May 4, 1994. The full text of this decision is available for inspection and copying during normal
business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision
also may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, International Transcriptions Service, 2100
M Street NW., Washington, DC 20036, (202) 857-3800.




Summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making






1. Section 17 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Cable Act) requires that
the Commission issue regulations to ensure compatibility between consumer equipment and cable systems. The goal
of Section 17 is to ensure that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefits and functions of their television
receivers and VCRs when receiving cable service.

2. Problems between cable systems and consumer TV equipment generally tend to arise from conflicts between new features
in consumer television equipment and the techniques used by cable systems to address security and other technical
operating considerations. Examples of TV receiver features affected by cable operating methods and devices include
functions that permit the subscriber:




_To watch a program on one channel while simultaneously recording a program on another channel;

_To record two programs that appear on different channels; or,

_To use advanced features such as picture in picture.

3. The rules adopted by the Commission are based on the findings and recommendations in its ``Report to Congress on
Means for Assuring Compatibility Between Cable Systems and Consumer Electronics Equipment'' and information provided
in comments submitted in response to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice) in this proceeding, 58 FR 65153, December
3, 1993. These rules include measures that will assure improved compatibility between existing cable system and
consumer TV equipment. They also include provisions for achieving more effective compatibility through new cable
and consumer equipment. The specific provisions of these regulations are essentially the same as those proposed
in the 

Notice

, with a number of modifications that address issues raised in the record. The new rules for improving compatibility
between existing cable system and consumer equipment require that cable operators:

(1) Refrain from scrambling program signals carried on the basic tier of service;

(2) Offer subscribers supplemental equipment to enable them to use the special features and functions of their TV
equipment with cable service; this includes providing subscribers the option of having simultaneous access to all
signals that do not need to be processed by a set-top device;

(3) Provide a consumer education program to inform subscribers of potential compatibility problems and methods
for resolving such problems; this includes notice that remote controls and supplemental equipment compatible with
the set-top devices used by the cable system are available from third-party vendors; and 

(4) Allow set-top devices that incorporate remote control capability to be operated with subscriber-owned remote
controls or otherwise take no action that would prevent the use of such remote controls, including changing the infrared
codes used to operate the remote control capabilities of the set-top devices they employ so as to adversely affect
the operation of consumer-purchased remote controls.

The compatibility rules for new equipment provide technical standards for ``cable ready'' consumer TV equipment
and require that both ``cable ready'' consumer TV equipment and cable systems use a standard cable channel plan.

4. The Commission also concluded that more effective compatibility between consumer TV equipment and cable systems
that use scrambling can be achieved through use of a standard interface connector, or ``Decoder Interface,'' in ``cable
ready'' consumer TV equipment and associated component descrambler/decoder devices to be provided by cable systems.
Used together, the Decoder Interface and component descrambler/decoder devices can eliminate the need for use of
a set-top cable box. However, based on indications that the cable and consumer electronics industries are close to
agreement on a new Decoder Interface standard that will serve both existing analog cable operations and also incorporate
flexibility to support new technologies and services, including digital cable service, the Commission found that
it would be appropriate to allow an additional period of time for the industries to complete their work on the new standard.
The Commission therefore did not act on the Decoder Interface standard and related issues now, but rather will allow
industry parties an additional 90 days to complete the new standard.
 The Commission stated that would develop rules establishing a standard for a Decoder Interface connector and requirements
for its use after that period.





5. As a policy matter, the Commission also found that standards for cable digital transmissions are desirable. These
standards will be needed to ensure that compatibility is maintained as new digital cable technologies and services
are introduced. The Commission stated that it was not, however, adopting technical standards or other rules in this
area at this time, as developmental work on cable digital technologies and services has not reached a stage where it
would be reasonable to attempt to specify such regulations. It stated that it will continue to monitor progress by
the industries in this area and will initiate a separate action on these issues as is necessary to assure continuing
compatibility in the future.

6. The Commission indicated that the actions in this First Report and Order will allow consumers to utilize equipment
offered by a variety of suppliers, including the cable system operator, in a competitive market. Thus, a number of
manufacturers and retailers will be able to increase their participation in markets to which they previously had
limited access. Opening these markets to competitive equipment providers will give product developers and manufacturers,
as well as cable system operators, the ability and incentives to introduce new products and to respond to consumer
demand. In return, consumers will have greater access to technology with new features and functions. Most importantly,
consumers will be assured that the equipment they buy will work with their cable system.

7. The Commission further indicated that open entry for equipment provision ensures that the equipment market remains
competitive. In addition to open markets and incentives for innovation, another key component of competition is
information. The new regulations ensure not only that the marketplace will be open and equipment options available
to consumers, but that consumers will be informed about their choices. Competition could be stifled unless consumers
are informed about their equipment options. By structuring the regulations to promote innovation and competition,
the Commission expects increased investment in new technology development and increased economic activity as consumers
purchase the new, competitively priced equipment. 

8. Accordingly, it is ordered that parts 15 and 76 of the Commission's rules are amended as set forth below, effective
30 days after the publication of this final rule in the 

Federal Register

. This action is taken pursuant to authority provided in sections 4(i), 7(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r)
and 324A of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 157(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r)
and 324A.

of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

(c) Cable ready consumer electronics equipment must meet the following technical performance requirements. Compliance
with these requirements shall be determined by performing measurements at the unfiltered IF output port. Where appropriate,
the Commission will consider allowing alternative measurement methods.

(1) 

Adjacent channel interference. 

In the presence of a lower adjacent channel CW signal that is 1.5 MHz below the desired visual carrier in frequency and
10 dB below the desired visual carrier in amplitude, spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at
least 55 dB below the visual carrier of the desired signal. The desired input signal shall be an NTSC visual carrier
modulated with a 10 IRE flat field and the aural carrier should be unmodulated. Measurements are to be performed for
input signal levels of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV, with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced channels specified in the EIA
IS-132 channel plan.

(2) 

Image channel interference.

 Image channel interference within the IF passband shall be attenuated below the visual carrier of the desired channel
by at least 60 dB from 54 MHz to 806 MHz. In testing for compliance with this standard, the desired input signal is to be
an NTSC visual carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field and the aural carrier should be unmodulated. The undesired
test signal shall be a CW signal equal in amplitude to the desired visual carrier and located 90 MHz above the visual
carrier frequency of the desired channel. Measurements shall be performed for input signals of 0 dBmV and +15 dBmV,
with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced channels specified in the EIA IS-132 channel plan.

(3) 

Direct pickup interference. 

The direct pickup (DPU) of a co-channel interfering ambient field by a cable ready device shall not exceed the following
criteria. The ratio of the desired to undesired signal levels at the IF passband on each channel shall be at least 45
dB. The average ratio over the six channels shall be at least 50 dB. The desired input signal shall be an NTSC signal having
a visual carrier level of 0 dBmV. The equipment under test (EUT) shall be placed on a rotatable table that is one meter
in height. Any excess length of the power cord and other connecting leads shall be coiled on the floor under the table.
The EUT shall be immersed in a horizontally polarized uniform CW field of 100 mV/m at a frequency 2.55 MHz above the visual
carrier of the EUT tuned channel. Measurements shall be made with the EUT tuned to six EIA IS-132 channels, two
each in the low VHF, high VHF and UHF broadcast bands. On each channel, the levels at the IF passband due to the desired
and interfering signals are to be measured.

(4) 

Tuner overload. 

Spurious signals within the IF passband shall be attenuated at least 55 dB from 54 to 806 MHz below the visual carrier
of the desired channel using a comb spectrum input with each signal individually set at +15 dBmV. Measurements shall
be made with the receiver tuned to ten evenly spaced EIA IS-132 channels.

(5) 

Cable input conducted emissions. 

Conducted spurious emissions that appear at the cable input to the device must meet the following criteria. The input
shall be an NTSC video carrier modulated with a 10 IRE flat field at a level of 0 dBmV and with a visual to aural ratio of
10 dB. The aural carrier shall be unmodulated. The peak level of the spurious signals will be measured using a spectrum
analyzer connected by a directional coupler to the cable input of the equipment under test. Spurious signal levels
must not exceed the limits in the following table:




From 54 MHz up to and including 300 MHz-26 dBmV

From 300 MHz up to and including 450 MHz-20 dBmV
From 450 MHz up to and including 806 MHz-15 dBmV




The average of the measurements on multiple channels from 450 MHz up to and including 806 MHz shall be no greater than
^20 dBmV. Measurements shall be made with the receiver tuned to at least four EIA IS-132 channels in each of the
above bands. The test channels are to be evenly distributed across each of the bands. Measurements for conducted emissions
caused by sources internal to the device are to be made in a shielded room. Measurements for conducted emissions caused
by external signal sources shall be made in an ambient RF field whose field strength is 100 mV/m, following the same
test conditions as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(d) The field strength of radiated emissions from cable ready consumer electronics equipment shall not exceed the
limits in  15.109(a) when measured in accordance with the applicable procedures specified in  15.31
and  15.35 for unintentional radiators, with the following modifications. During testing the NTSC input signal
level is to be +15 dBmV, with a visual to aural ratio of 10 dB. The visual carrier is to be modulated by a 10 IRE flat field;
the aural carrier is to be unmodulated. Measurements are to be taken on six EIA IS-132 channels evenly spaced
across the required RF input range of the equipment under test.






Note: 

The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are applicable as of June 30, 1997.

9. New  76.630 is added to read as follows:


 76.630

Compatibility with consumer electronics equipment.


(a) Cable system operators shall not scramble or otherwise encrypt signals carried on the basic service tier. Requests
for waivers of this prohibition must demonstrate either a substantial problem with theft of basic tier service or
a strong need to scramble basic signals for other reasons. As part of this showing, cable operators are required to
notify subscribers by mail of waiver requests. The notice to subscribers must be mailed no later than thirty calendar
days from the date the request waiver was filed with the Commission, and cable operators must inform the Commission
in writing, as soon as possible, of that notification date. The notification to subscribers must state:



On (date of waiver request was filed with the Commission), (cable operator's name) filed with the Federal Communications
Commission a request for waiver of the rule prohibiting scrambling of channels on the basic tier of service. 47 CFR
 76.630(a). The request for waiver states (a brief summary of the waiver request). A copy of the request for waiver
is on file for public inspection at (the address of the cable operator's local place of business).
Individuals who wish to comment on this request for waiver should mail comments to the Federal Communications Commission
by no later than 30 days from (the date the notification was mailed to subscribers). Those comments should be addressed
to the: Federal Communications Commission, Cable Services Bureau, Washington, DC 20554, and should include the
name of the cable operator to whom the comments are applicable. Individuals should also send a copy of their comments
to (the cable operator at its local place of business).



Cable operators may file comments in reply no later than 7 days from the date subscriber comments must be filed.


(b) Cable system operators that provide their subscribers with cable system terminal devices and other customer
premises equipment that incorporates remote control capability shall permit the remote operation of such devices
with commercially available remote control units or otherwise take no action that would prevent the devices from
being operated by a commercially available remote control unit. Cable system operators are advised that this requirement
obliges them to actively enable the remote control functions of customer premises equipment where those functions
do not operate without a special activation procedure. Cable system operators may, however, disable the remote control
functions of a subscriber's customer premises equipment where requested by the subscriber.
(c) Cable operators may not alter the infrared codes used to operate the remote control capabilities of the customer
premises equipment they employ in providing service to subscribers. Cable operators may, however, use new equipment
that includes additional infrared codes for new remote control functions that were not included in existing models
of customer premises equipment.
(d) Cable system operators that use scrambling, encryption or similar technologies in conjunction with cable system
terminal devices, as defined in  15.1(e) of this chapter, that may affect subscribers' reception of signals
shall offer to supply each subscriber with special equipment that will enable the simultaneous reception of multiple
signals. This equipment could include, for example, set-top cable system terminal devices with multiple descramblers/decoders
and/or timers, and signal bypass switches.
(1) The offer of special equipment shall be made to new subscribers at the time they subscribe and to all subscribers
at least once each year.
(2) Such special equipment shall, at a minimum, have the capability:
(i) To allow simultaneous reception of any two or more scrambled or encrypted signals and to provide for tuning to alternative
channels on a pre-programmed schedule; and,

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-0-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-0-00027 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) To allow direct reception of all other signals that do not need to be processed through descrambling or decryption
circuitry (this capability can generally be provided through a separate by-pass switch or through internal by-pass
circuitry in a cable system terminal device).
(3) Cable system operators shall determine the specific equipment needed by individual subscribers on a case-by-case
basis, in consultation with the subscriber. Cable system operators are required to make a good faith effort to provide
subscribers with the amount and types of special equipment needed to resolve their individual compatibility problems.
(4) Cable operators shall provide such equipment at the request of individual subscribers and may charge for purchase
or lease of the equipment and its installation in accordance with the provisions of the rate regulation rules for customer
premises equipment used to receive the basic service tier, as set forth in  76.923. Notwithstanding the required
annual offering, cable operators shall respond to subscriber requests for special equipment for reception of multiple
signals that are made at any time.
(e) Cable system operators shall provide a consumer education program on compatibility matters to their subscribers
in writing, as follows:
(1) The consumer information program shall be provided to subscribers at the time they first subscribe and at least
once a year thereafter. Cable operators may choose the time and means by which they comply with the annual consumer
information requirement. This requirement may be satisfied by a once-a-year mailing to all subscribers. The information
may be included in one of the cable system's regular subscriber billings.
(2) The consumer information program shall include the following information:
(i) Cable system operators shall inform their subscribers that some models of TV receivers and videocassette recorders
may not be able to receive all of the channels offered by the cable system when connected directly to the cable system.
In conjunction with this information, cable system operators shall briefly explain, the types of channel compatibility
problems that could occur if subscribers connected their equipment directly to the cable system and offer suggestions
for resolving those problems. Such suggestions could include, for example, the use of a cable system terminal device
such as a set-top channel converter. Cable system operators shall also indicate that channel compatibility problems
associated with reception of programming that is not scrambled or encrypted programming could be resolved through
use of simple converter devices without descrambling or decryption capabilities that can be obtained from either
the cable system or a third party retail vendor.
(ii) In cases where service is received through a cable system terminal device, cable system operators shall indicate
that subscribers may not be able to use special features and functions of their TV receivers and videocassette recorders,
including features that allow the subscriber to: view a program on one channel while simultaneously recording a program
on another channel; record two or more consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and, use advanced
picture generation and display features such as ``Picture-in-Picture,'' channel review and other functions that
necessitate channel selection by the consumer device.
(iii) In cases where cable system operators offer remote control capability with cable system terminal devices and
other customer premises equipment that is provided to subscribers, they shall advise their subscribers that remote
control units that are compatible with that equipment may be obtained from other sources, such as retail outlets.
Cable system operators shall also provide a representative list of the models of remote control units currently available
from retailers that are compatible with the customer premises equipment they employ. Cable system operators are
required to make a good faith effort in compiling this list and will not be liable for inadvertent omissions. This list
shall be current as of no more than six months before the date the consumer education program is distributed to subscribers.
Cable operators are also required to encourage subscribers to contact the cable operator to inquire about whether
a particular remote control unit the subscriber might be considering for purchase would be compatible with the subscriber's
customer premises equipment.





Note:

 The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are applicable as of July 31, 1994, and June 30, 1994, respectively.
The provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section are applicable as of October 31, 1994, except for the requirement
under section (d)(1)(i) of this section for cable system operators to supply cable system terminal devices with multiple
tuners, which is applicable as of October 31, 1995. The initial offer of special equipment to all subscribers, as required
under paragraph (d) of this section shall be made by October 31, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Emergency interim rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS publishes this interim emergency rule at the request of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council)
to prohibit the taking of live rock in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) from the Pasco/Hernando
County line in Florida to the Alabama/Mississippi boundary; and, in the Gulf EEZ off Florida south of the Pasco/Hernando
County line, to prohibit the use of power-assisted tools to break up or dislodge pieces of live rock and to establish
a daily vessel harvest and possession limit for live rock of 25 5-gallon (19-liter) buckets. The intended effect of
this rule is to protect live rock resources and fishery habitat in the Gulf. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf are managed under the Fishery Management
Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf Council
and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations
at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding mollusk shells), and therefore is a ``fish'' within the meaning of the Magnuson Act.
Live rock is collected by SCUBA divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for mini-reef
aquaria. In 1992, reported live rock landings in Florida from the EEZ totaled 783,145 lbs (355,228 kg) with an ex-vessel
value of $864,521. (Florida had previously banned the harvest of live rock in its waters.) In 1992, Florida implemented
regulations to phase out landings of live rock from the EEZ off Florida over a 3-year period ending in 1995. 

In 1993 a Federal court overturned these regulations (Southeastern Fisheries Ass'n, Inc. v. Chiles, 979 F.2d 1504
(11th Cir. 1992). 

At the request of Gulf Council members from Florida and Alabama, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils initiated development
of Amendment 2 to the FMP to address management of live rock in the EEZ. Similar to coral reefs, the current focus of the
FMP, live rock resources are essentially nonrenewable and serve as habitat for a variety of other organisms. 

In the recent public review process during the development of Amendment 2, the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils received
testimony that rock outcroppings, that are important reef fish habitats, are being removed and sold as live rock for
marine aquariums. Testimony from about 60 divers and fishermen indicated that removal of live rock by harvesters
in the northern Gulf is causing severe damage to the limited outcroppings or rock ledges and reefs that occur in state
and Federal waters. Divers and fishermen testified that some small banks have disappeared and many ledges off the
Florida Panhandle have been seriously damaged. Such outcroppings are not nearly as abundant in this area as they are
off southern Florida. These nonrenewable resources serve as essential habitat for reef fish and invertebrates.
Accordingly, the Gulf Council requested an emergency rule to prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ of the Gulf
from the Pasco/Hernando County line in Florida to the Alabama/Mississippi boundary. 

The Gulf and South Atlantic Councils also heard testimony that pneumatic drills and hammers are being used to break
large rock ledges into harvestable pieces. This results in large-scale destruction of reef fish habitat. Testimony
indicated that large vessels with numerous divers and equipped with power-assisted gear can devastate a rock ledge
very quickly. To prevent further acceleration of harvest of live rock before the management measures proposed for
inclusion in Amendment 2 can be implemented, the Gulf Council also requested a prohibition on the use of power-assisted
tools and a daily vessel harvest and possession limit, both of which would apply to the harvest of live rock in the EEZ
of the Gulf south of the Pasco/Hernando County line. 

Live rock or live bottom habitats are at such a premium in the northern Gulf that local government and private organizations
have been active in constructing artificial reefs to supplement natural habitats off the coasts of Alabama and Florida.
Loss of these natural, nonrenewable, habitat areas because of live rock collections presents a serious threat to
marine habitat resources. 

According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the closure of the Gulf EEZ from Florida's Pasco/Hernando
County line to the Alabama/Mississippi boundary to live rock collecting will affect approximately 16 fishermen
and live rock dealers who reported landings of live rock in Florida and Alabama in 1993. 

The daily vessel harvest and possession limit and the prohibition on the use of power tools were widely supported by
industry representatives during the last three public hearings conducted in conjunction with Gulf Council meetings.
These restrictions are expected to affect only a few individuals who allegedly are taking up to 10,000 lbs (4,536 kg)
of live rock per trip using power tools.

Amendment 2 is scheduled to be submitted for Secretarial review by the Councils in July 1994. It is expected that Amendment
2 will implement the measures in this emergency interim rule on a more permanent basis and include a phase-out schedule
for live rock harvests in other areas. 


Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules 


The Gulf Council and NMFS have concluded that the present situation constitutes biological and conservation emergencies,
which are properly addressed by this emergency interim rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines
for the use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). The situation (1) results from recent, unforeseen
events or recently discovered circumstances; (2) presents a serious management problem; and (3) realizes immediate
benefits from the emergency interim rule that outweigh the value of advance notice, public comment, and deliberative
consideration expected under the normal rulemaking process. The basis for the conclusions regarding emergency
guidelines (1) and (2) was summarized above. 
Regarding the realization of immediate benefits, the Gulf Council has determined that an emergency rule under section
305(c) of the Magnuson Act is the only means for immediately addressing the biological emergency involving the Gulf
live rock resources. 
Going through the formal FMP amendment process would delay implementation of the required measures and would result
in substantial damage to live rock resources and fishery habitats in the Gulf. This emergency interim rule will prevent
live rock collection in the northern Gulf and slow the harvesting rate in the rest of the Gulf EEZ until annual quotas
and a phase-out can be implemented under Amendment 2 through the normal FMP amendment and rulemaking process. 
NMFS concurs with the Gulf Council's findings about the biological emergency regarding Gulf live rock resources
and the need for immediate regulatory action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, effective
initially for 90 days, as authorized by section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act. By agreement of NMFS and the Gulf Council,
this emergency interim rule may be extended for an additional period of 90 days. 


Classification 


The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator), has determined that this rule is necessary
to respond to an emergency situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
This emergency interim rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The Assistant Administrator finds for good cause under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
that the need to prevent further environmental damage and loss of fishery habitat makes it impracticable and contrary
to the public interest to provide prior notice and opportunity for public comment on this rule. Similarly, to implement
measures to address the conservation and biological emergencies in a timely manner, the Assistant Administrator
finds for good cause under section 553(d)(3) of the APA that the effective date of this rule should not be delayed.

Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is implementing a regulatory amendment to require increased observer coverage and improved equipment for estimating
groundfish total catches by vessels and processors participating in the Western Alaska Community Development Quota
(CDQ) pollock fisheries. This action is intended to improve estimates of total groundfish catches in the CDQ fisheries.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Fishing for groundfish by operators of U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands
(BSAI) management area is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the Fishery Management Plan
for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI Area (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
(Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and is implemented by regulations
governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR part 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries
appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
This regulatory amendment will require increased observer coverage and improved equipment for estimating total
catch for vessels and processors participating in the Western Alaska CDQ pollock fisheries. Two NMFS-certified
observers will be required on processor vessels, one or more observers in shoreside processing operations, and one
observer on catcher vessels delivering to processors. In addition, processor vessels will be required to have either
measured, marked, and certified fish-receiving bins to improve volumetric estimates of total catch, or scales to
weigh total catch. A description of, and reasons for, these actions were discussed in the proposed rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68386). Public comment on the proposed rule was invited through January 26, 1994. Four letters
of comment were received within the comment period. 
Management of the CDQs requires an estimate of the total catch weight of pollock for each vessel participating in the
CDQ fisheries. The purpose of this rule is to standardize the equipment available to observers to make volumetric
estimates of the weight of all groundfish caught, including pollock, or to require that the fish be weighed. 
The volume of fish in the bin is determined by the area of the base of the bin and the height of fish throughout the bin.
Fish poured into bins do not always form a flat, smooth surface, or settle at the same height throughout the bin. The
surface of the fish often slopes from front to back or from one side to another in the bin. Fish may stack up higher in one
corner than in others or pile up in the middle of the bin. 
The process of making volumetric estimates of the catch using certified bins generally occurs in five steps. 

First

, a certified engineer, or other authorized person, measures the inside of all bins that will be used to make volumetric
estimates of catch weight, witnesses the placement of marked increments every 10 cm on the internal sides of the bin,
and prepares a height-to-volume conversion table that indicates the volume of the bin, in cubic meters, below the
level of each 10-cm increment. 

Second

, the observer estimates the average height of fish in a bin by visual inspection. In order to determine the average
height of fish in a bin, an observer must be able to see the level of fish throughout the bin. 

Third

, the observer uses a height-to-volume conversion table to determine the volume associated with the average height
of fish in the bin. 

Fourth

, the observer applies a density factor indicating weight per unit volume (metric tons (mt) per cubic meter (m) or mt/m3)
to estimate the total weight of all fish in the bin. 

Fifth

, the observer samples a portion of the fish in the bin to determine species composition (the proportion of each species
or species group) and applies this distribution to the estimate of total groundfish weight to estimate the total weight
of pollock. This last step provides the observer's estimate of pollock catch that is attributed to the vessel and applied
against the CDQ. The volumetric methods are used to estimate the total catch weight of all groundfish, and species
composition samples are used to estimate how much of that groundfish is pollock.

Changes From the Proposed Rule 


There are three changes from the proposed rule in the final rule. The first change is to delete the phrase ``NMFS or U.S.
Coast Guard enforcement'' from sentences referring to authorized officers in  675.27 (h)(2)(i)(A) and (ii)(B)(

1

). Removing the phrase makes the references consistent with the definition of authorized officers in 50 CFR 620.2.
The second change is to clarify the intent of the first sentence of  675.27(h)(2)(ii) by replacing the phrase
``estimate its total weight'' with ``estimate the total weight of its groundfish catch''. The third change is to clarify
the intent of  675.27(h)(2)(ii)(A)(

2

). The requirement that marked increments be readable from the outside of the bin at all times has been changed to read
``Marked increments, except those on the wall containing the viewing port or window, must be readable from the outside
of the bin at all times.'' The phrase ``on each side of the bin'' is deleted from the last sentence of the paragraph. Although
NMFS requires that all internal sides of the bin be marked, the markings on the side of the bin containing the viewing
port or window need not be visible from the outside of all bins. This issue is also addressed in the response to Comment
9. 
Four letters of comment were received during the comment period. One letter was in support of the rule. Three letters
included comments or suggestions on technical or operational aspects of the rule. Fourteen individual comments
were contained in these four letters. No comments were in opposition to the rule. 


Comment 1:

 Increased observer coverage and improved equipment for estimating total catch in the CDQ fisheries will be beneficial
to fishery managers and to CDQ fishing partners. 


Response:

 NMFS concurs. 


Comment 2:

 NMFS should identify standards for catch measurement and leave it to the industry to decide what equipment and methods
would meet those standards. 


Response:

 This rule offers two options for processor vessels to provide improved estimates of catch in the CDQ fisheries. One
is based on volumetric estimates and the other is based on a scale weight. While a performance standard for the accuracy
of a scale system can be established by NMFS and tested by an observer, the same standard of accuracy cannot be established
for volumetric estimates. The accuracy of a scale system depends on the performance of a piece of equipment, while
the accuracy of volumetric estimates depends on the accurate measuring of the bin volume, on the ability of an observer
to determine the volume visually, and on variation in the density of the fish. The only way to test the accuracy of volumetric
estimates of total groundfish catch weight is to compare the volumetric estimates of fish weight with the scale weight
of the same fish. A scale large enough to assess the accuracy of volumetric estimates of catch aboard a processor vessel
would be more effectively used to weigh the catch directly. Rather than specifying an accuracy standard for volumetric
estimates, NMFS has established guidelines for the equipment that must be provided for the observer to make volumetric
estimates. 


Comment 3:

 NMFS should fairly apply regulations for improved total catch weight to all sectors. 


Response:

 This rule addresses only processors and vessels participating in the CDQ fisheries. All catcher vessels must meet
the same requirements, regardless of their size. Shoreside processors are required to report scale weights, because
scales are currently available in all the plants. All processor vessels are offered the same options to provide improved
estimates of catch. 


Comment 4:

 The appropriate method for estimating total catch weight should distinguish between the pelagic pollock fisheries
and other mixed-species fisheries. 


Response:

 The CDQ fisheries are predominantly pelagic pollock fisheries in that most trawl hauls contain 95 percent or more
pollock by weight. The primary difference between pelagic pollock fisheries and mixed-species fisheries, with
respect to volumetric estimates of total groundfish catch weight, is the appropriate density factor to use in the
volume-to-weight conversion. NMFS distinguishes between the pelagic pollock fishery and other mixed-species
fisheries by applying a standard density factor of 0.93 mt/m3 for all trawl hauls in the pelagic pollock fishery and
by using the observer's estimate of the appropriate density factor for hauls with less than 95 percent pollock. 


Comment 5:

 The appropriate location of certified marks inside bins depends on the configuration of the individual bin and should
be determined on a case-by-case basis. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees that many bins have different configurations and that specifying the location and number of certified
markings that would provide the most accurate volumetric estimates from each bin on each vessel may be more desirable.
However, NMFS does not have the resources to review and approve the bin configurations for individual vessels. For
this reason, the final rule contains specifications that must be met for each bin used to make volumetric estimates
of catch weight. 


Comment 6:

 Vessel owners should be required to submit a description of the system they plan on using, with endorsement by prospective
certifiers, well in advance of the effective date, to assure that they have selected a workable system and that they
have adequate time to get it in place and certified. 


Response:

 The processor or vessel owners are responsible for completing these modifications by the effective date 
(i.e., August 15, 1994, see  675.27(h)(2)). Therefore, NMFS is providing approximately 3 months for modifications
to the vessel that may be necessary under this rule. 


Comment 7:

 Visual access to the bins and to all walls in the bins is difficult to achieve, costly, and sometimes impossible.

Response:

 Information about the average height of fish in a bin is a critical element in volumetric estimates of groundfish catch
weight. NMFS believes that processor vessel operators must provide the appropriate viewing ports or windows, bin
lighting, and readable markings in order to provide the observer with the opportunity to make an estimate of the average
height of fish in the bin that is as accurate as possible. 


Comment 8:

 Marking all internal walls of a bin may result in less accurate estimates of the height of fish in the bin than could be
obtained by marking fewer walls. For example, if all markings in a bin with more than four walls were used to calculate
a simple average of the height of fish in the bin, the procedure would skew the height estimate toward the part of the
bin with the most marked walls. 


Response:

 The accuracy of the estimates of height of fish in a bin is based on the procedure used by the observer to determine average
height and not necessarily on the number of marked walls. Identifying the sides of the bin that would always provide
the best information to observers is difficult, because the surface of the fish in the bin is often not level or smooth
due to the trim of the vessel or other reasons. NMFS believes that the requirement to mark all internal sides of the bins
provides the maximum amount of reference points for an observer. Observers will use as much information as is available
to determine the average height of fish in a bin, but they will not be instructed to calculate a simple average of the
height of fish at each marked wall for reasons suggested in the letter of comment. 
The rule requires that vessel operators submit certification documents prepared by an authorized, independent
agent who measured the bins, witnessed the location of the marks, and calculated the volume of the bin associated with
each set of marks. Instructions or recommendations from the certifying agent to estimate properly the average height
of fish in the bin, or to use height-to-volume conversion tables, would improve the reliability of the volumetric
estimates. 


Comment 9:

 It is not necessary to mark the inside of the bin wall that contains the viewing port or window, because the observer
cannot see these marks from outside the bin. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees that, for some bins, an observer would not be able to see the marks on the bin wall that contains the viewing
port. However, in other cases, the observer can look inside the bin from the viewing port and see the level of fish against
the wall that contains the viewing port, thereby increasing the accuracy of the estimated average height of fish in
the bin. NMFS prefers one standard for all bins used for volumetric estimates. NMFS will continue to require markings
on all internal walls of the bin, but will not require that the markings on the side of the bin that contains the viewing
port or window be readable from the outside of the bin. 


Comment 10:

 Ultrasonic bin level sensors (bin sensors) should be considered as an alternative to determine the average height
of fish in bins that are not visually accessible. 


Response:

 Bin sensors employ transducers installed in the overhead of the bin to measure the distance from the top of the bin to
the surface of the fish in the bin. The transducers determine distance by ``sounding'' or measuring the amount of time
it takes for an ultrasonic sound wave to travel from the transducer to the surface of the fish. The average height of
fish could be estimated by locating transducers in several places throughout a bin. 
NMFS has two concerns about the use of bin sensors. First, the appropriate number of transducers, location of the transducers,
and direction in which they are pointed are important determinants of the accuracy of the information provided from
the bin sensors. The appropriate system design depends on the configuration of the individual bin, the way fish are
loaded into the bin, and the distribution of fish once inside the bin. Developing regulations that would specify a
general system design applicable to all bins would be difficult. Also, NMFS does not have the resources to review and
evaluate system designs for individual bins or to work with the industry to develop the appropriate configuration
for individual bins. 
The second, and more serious, concern relates to NMFS' ability to monitor both the initial calibration of the bin sensors
and their use aboard the processor vessel to determine the level of fish in a bin. One mothership in the Alaska groundfish
fisheries currently uses bin sensors to make volumetric estimates of the groundfish catch delivered by catcher vessels.
However, these bin sensors are installed in fish receiving bins that have markings on the internal sides of the bins
that can be seen from outside the bin. In this case, there is little difficulty in verifying the readings of the bin sensors.

Once properly calibrated, the transducers should continue to perform accurately unless the equipment malfunctions
or breaks down. However, the bin sensors can be recalibrated at any time to provide either more or less accurate readings.
NMFS does not intend to monitor the use of bin sensors by requiring that only observers have access to the control panel.

Representatives of a bin-sensor manufacturer suggested that each bin should contain five transducers, each of which
would take an individual reading of the height of fish in the bin directly below the transducer. Transducers can be
calibrated individually. Therefore, in order to verify that all transducers are reading accurately, hatches would
have to be placed in the overhead of the bin next to each transducer so that the observer could drop a tape measure and
check the distance against that recorded by the bin sensor. NMFS believes that this procedure would be burdensome
to the processor vessel operator because of the necessity to place up to five hatches in each bin to verify transducer
readings, and that it would be time-consuming and difficult for the observer. 
The manufacturer's representative also suggested that the information from the initial calibration of the system,
such as the distance from each transducer to the bottom of the bin, could be used to determine whether the system had
been recalibrated. NMFS is concerned that the bin sensors could be recalibrated, and then changed back to the original
calibration without the knowledge of the observer. Although NMFS believes that bin sensors could accurately estimate
the height of fish in a bin, NMFS is not satisfied that observers have the capability or the time to monitor the system
to assure accurate information about the volume of fish in enclosed and inaccessible bins. 


Comment 11:

 An opening in the top or overhead of a bin through which a tape measure could be lowered into the bin should be considered
as an alternative method for determining the average height of fish in bins that are not visually accessible. 


Response:

 NMFS believes that reliable estimates of the volume of fish in a fish bin must be determined from averaging the height
of fish in a bin from several locations in the bin. A single reading at the center of the bin may not provide accurate information
if the fish are unevenly distributed throughout the bin. 


Comment 12:

 A narrow vertical window extending the full height of one wall of the bin with marks on the outside of the bin should be
considered as an alternative method for determining the average height of fish in bins that are not visually accessible.



Response:

 This suggestion would provide the observer with a height reading at only one location in the bin which, for reasons
discussed above, is not sufficient to determine the average height of fish in the bin. 


Comment 13:

 The use of scales to weigh groundfish harvests is a costly alternative. 


Response:

 NMFS recognizes that a marine scale capable of accurately weighing groundfish harvests will cost between $30,000
and $50,000 per scale. This does not include the cost of installation and maintenance. This rule allows processors
to choose either modification of their bins to accommodate volumetric estimates or scales to weigh groundfish harvests
in the CDQ fisheries. 


Comment 14:

 It is not feasible for processor vessel operators to weigh each species or species group of fish separately. 


Response:

 This rule does not require weight by species or species group for management of the CDQ pollock fisheries. 


Classification 



The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined that this rule is necessary for the conservation
and management of the groundfish fisheries off Alaska and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable
laws. 
This final rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of E.O. 12866.

The AA has determined that this rule could have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
A copy of the FRFA is available (see 

ADDRESSES

). 
This rule contains new collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44
U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.) that have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0648-0269. The public's
reporting burden for each requirement is indicated in the following description and includes the time for reviewing
instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. The new reporting requirements are: (1) CDQ-managing organizations must arrange
for processors to transmit copies of daily observer catch messages to them in a manner that allows the CDQ-managing
organization to inform processors to cease fishing operations before the CDQ allocations have been exceeded (5 minutes
per message); (2) scale printouts of each CDQ delivery must be maintained in the processing operation for the duration
of the fishing year, or for as long after a fishing year that the products from fish harvested during that year are retained
in the processing operation (8 minutes per delivery day); (3) the volumes of bins aboard processing vessels must be
certified in writing by an independent registered engineer (8 hours); and shoreside processors must notify the observers
of the offloading schedule of each CDQ groundfish delivery at least 1 hour prior to offloading (2 minutes). Send comments
regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

) and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer, NOAA (Paperwork Reduction Project 0648-0269),

Acting Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service.




For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 675 is amended as follows: 


PART 675_GROUNDFISH OF THE BERING SEA AND ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AREA 


1. The authority citation for part 675 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 16 U.S.C. 1801 

et seq.



 

2. In  675.27, paragraph (e)(4) is revised and a new paragraph (h) is added to read as follows: 



 675.27 

Western Alaska Community Development Quota Program (applicable through December 31, 1995). 


* * * * * 


(e) * * * 
(4) It is the responsibility of the CDQ-managing organization to cease fishing operations once its respective CDQ
pollock allocation has been reached. Total pollock harvests for each CDP will be determined by observer estimates
of total catch and catch composition as reported on the daily observer catch message. The CDQ-managing organization
must arrange for processors to transmit a copy of the observer daily catch message to it in a manner that allows the CDQ-managing
organization to inform processors to cease fishing operations before the CDQ allocation has been exceeded. CDQ-managing
organization representatives must also inform NMFS within 24 hours after the CDQ has been reached and fishing has
ceased. If NMFS determines that the observer, the processor, or the CDQ-managing organization failed to follow the
procedures described in paragraph (h) of this section for estimating the total harvest of pollock, or violated any
other regulation in this part, NMFS reserves the right to estimate the total pollock harvest based on the best available
data.
