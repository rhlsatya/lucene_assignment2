COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 







Proposed Amendments to Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor Disclosure Rules 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rules. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing substantial revisions to the
disclosure framework applicable to commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'').
The proposed amendments reflect the Commission's experience in applying the disclosure requirements set forth
in part 4 of the Commission's rules and significant evolution in the purposes, structure and activities of the managed
funds marketplace. These proposed modifications of the CPO and CTA disclosure framework are designed to achieve
greater simplicity, focus and clarity in performance history presentations; streamlining of other required disclosures;
and a more concise and readable format for disclosure documents.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Commission Rule 4.21
 requires that each CPO registered or required to be registered under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'' or ``CEA''),
7 U.S.C. 1 et seq. (1988 & Supp. 1992), provide prospective participants with a disclosure document containing
the information specified in the rule on or before the date it solicits, accepts or receives funds, securities or other
property from prospective participants for a pool it operates or intends to operate. Each CTA who is registered or
required to be registered is also required, by Rule 4.31, to deliver a disclosure document prior to or at the time of
soliciting or entering into an agreement to direct or guide the commodity interest account of a prospective client.
These requirements were first promulgated on January 8, 1979, when the Commission published part 4 of its regulations
relating to the operations and activities of CPOs and CTAs.

I. Summary of Proposed Rule Changes 



Based upon more than fifteen years of experience with administering the part 4 disclosure framework for CPOs and CTAs,
the Commission has undertaken a comprehensive review of the disclosure requirements for CPOs and CTAs to identify
areas in which the regulatory structure can be streamlined or simplified, while continuing to provide appropriate
customer protection. Rules 4.7 and 4.8 were adopted in August 1992 as a result of the first phase of this review.

3

 This proposal represents the second phase of the Commission's review of part 4, which will also include consideration
of the appropriateness of a two-part format for pool disclosure documents.

4

 The Commission is seeking public comment on proposed revisions of Rules 4.21 and 4.31. The amendments have three major
purposes: (1) Simplification of past performance disclosures; (2) reduction of required disclosures as to matters
of secondary relevance; and (3) clarification and modernization of various requirements. In addition, Rules 4.21
and 4.31 would be redrafted, reorganized and renumbered with a view towards greater clarity, simplicity and congruence
with contemporary managed funds practices. 






Proposed revisions to the disclosure requirements for CPO disclosure documents include the following.

A. Performance Disclosures 



Under the proposal, past performance disclosures would be simplified and streamlined as follows. 

1. All past performance presentations for pools would be reduced to a summary format containing specified core information.


2. For pools which have been in operation for at least three years, the only past performance record required generally
would be that of the pool offered. 

3. For pools with less than a three-year history, only the performance records of the pool offered, other pools operated
by the CPO, CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the aggregate initial futures margins and commodity option
premiums for the pool offered and investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered
generally would be required. If the CPO has less than a three-year history, the past performance records of the CPO's
principals would be required to be disclosed. 

4. Certain performance data of secondary relevance to the pool offering would be replaced by a statement indicating
whether that performance was ``adverse,''

 i.e.

, the performance was one hundred basis points lower than the relevant Treasury Bill rate or the pool had to be terminated
due to poor performance pursuant to a loss termination provision. 



B. Non-Performance Disclosures 



Non-performance disclosures would be revised as follows. 

1. Required disclosures concerning the litigation history of futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') would be
significantly reduced. 

2. Disclosure of the business backgrounds of principals would be limited to principals who participate in making
trading or operational decisions for the pool or CTA. 

3. Requirements for disclosure of conflicts of interest would no longer make specific reference to FCMs and introducing
brokers (``IBs''). However, a general requirement to disclose conflicts of interest on the part of any persons providing
services to the pool, which would encompass FCMs and IBs as well as persons who may not be Commission registrants, would
be included. 

4. The required description of each fee and expense of the pool would be supplemented by a tabular presentation of fees
and expenses setting forth how the ``break-even point'' for the pool is calculated. The break-even point is the per-unit
profit that the pool must realize during its first year for a participant to recoup his initial investment in the pool.




C. Format Improvements to Enhance Readability 



A number of revisions to the rules are being proposed to enhance the accessibility and prominence of relevant disclosures.
Disclosure documents would be required to contain a table of contents. General information concerning the pool,
including the break-even point, would be required to be set forth in the forepart of the document. The number and content
of various previously required bold-face ``boilerplate'' cautionary statements would be reduced and all information
voluntarily provided would be required to follow the relevant required disclosures. 



D. Other Revisions 



Changes are also proposed to generally facilitate pool offerings, particularly with respect to areas of overlap
or potential inconsistency with Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') rules. Thus, under the revisions,
CPOs may update pool disclosure documents every nine months, consistent with SEC requirements, rather than every
six months, as under current CFTC rules. In addition, CPOs may provide accredited investors with a notice of intended
offering and term sheet, prior to delivery of a disclosure document. 

Similar changes are proposed to be made to the requirements applicable to CTA disclosure documents. 

The proposed changes are more specifically discussed in the section-by-section analysis. 



II. Background 



In announcing the adoption of part 4 in 1979, the Commission stated that Rule 4.21, the basic disclosure document requirement
for CPOs, was intended ``to protect pool participants_particularly those who are unsophisticated in financial
matters_by ensuring that they are informed about the material facts regarding the pool before they commit their funds.''
 Similarly, Rule 4.31 was premised, in part, upon the view that ``a prospective [CTA] client or subscriber should be
aware of the advisor's commodity and general business experience if he is to make an informed decision as to whether
or not to avail himself of the advisor's services.''

Section 4.21 requires the disclosure document for commodity pools to contain various types of information concerning
the pool; the pool's CPO and CTA, and their principals; the FCM through which the pool's trades will be executed and
cleared; and the pool's IB, if applicable. This information includes, among other things, the pool's and CPO's form
of organization (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(i)); the pool's investment objectives (Rule 4.21(a)(1)(viii)); the business
backgrounds of the CPO and CTA and their principals (Rule 4.21(a)(2)); material administrative, civil or criminal
actions within the five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA, FCM and IB and their
principals (Rule 4.21(a)(13)(i)); conflicts of interest on the part of the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals
with respect to the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(3)(i)); the performance records of the pool and its CTA (Rules 4.21 (a)(4) and
(a)(5), respectively) and, if the pool has traded commodity interests for less than twelve months, the performance
of each other pool operated by the CPO and by each of its principals (Rule 4.21(a)(4)(i)(B)); a complete description
of each kind of expense that the pool has incurred in its preceding fiscal year or is expected to incur in its current
fiscal year (Rule 4.21(a)(7)) and of commissions or other fees that are paid or may be paid by the pool, its CPO, CTA or
their principals in connection with solicitations for the pool (Rule 4.21(a)(14)); and risk disclosure and cautionary
statements (Rules 4.21(a)(17) and 4.21(a)(18), respectively). 

The disclosure document for CTAs must contain, among other matters, the name and business background of the CTA and
each principal thereof (Rules 4.21(a)(1) and 4.21(a)(2), respectively); a description of the trading program (Rule
4.31(a)(1)(iii)); the types of commodity interests the CTA intends to trade (Rule 4.31(a)(v)); the performance
record of the CTA and its principals (Rule 4.31(a)(3)); a description of any conflict of interest regarding the trading
program on the part of the CTA, FCM, IB and their principals (Rule 4.31(a)(5)); material actions against the foregoing
persons (Rule 4.31(a)(7)); and risk disclosure and cautionary statements (Rules 4.31(a)(8) and 4.31(a)(9), respectively).


Since the adoption of Rules 4.21 and 4.31 in 1979, the number of registered CPOs has more than doubled and the number
of CTAs has increased nearly threefold.

7

 Assets under the 
management of CPOs have also grown dramatically
 and the range of available futures and option contracts has increased substantially.

9

 In addition, during the past decade, pool operations and investments have reflected increased diversity and complexity.
When Rule 4.21 came into effect, most CPOs operated one or two pools, and pools usually had one CPO which generally directed
the commodity interest trading for the pool or engaged the services of a CTA who invested pool assets directly in commodity
interest contracts. Increasingly, however, CPOs operate multiple pools, and commodity pools' and CTAs' investments
are more diverse and complex.

10

 A single commodity pool may engage multiple CTAs to provide advisory services for the pool and also invest in other
commodity pools (``investee pools'') or securities funds in order to access the services of particular traders or
advisors, to employ multiple trading strategies or programs, or to diversify its portfolio.

11

 ``Investee pools'' may also hold investments in other funds, resulting in multi-tiered structures of commodity
pools and other investment vehicles. Because of the proliferation of trading strategies and growing specialization
of CTAs, an increasing number of pools also retain ``trading managers'' to recommend or select CTAs for the pool or
to select funds for investment of the pool's assets. Many CPOs and trading managers follow dynamic asset allocation
strategies whereby the performance of the pool's CTAs is continuously reviewed and the selection of CTAs and allocation
of assets among them are subject to frequent modification. Other commodity pools are formed as vehicles for collective
access to particular CTAs whose services would not be readily available on a managed account basis and who are expected
to provide advisory services to the pool throughout its existence.

In implementing its statutory mandate to regulate the activities of CPOs and CTAs, the Commission has endeavored
to refine its rules as appropriate to respond to changing market conditions and to simplify and streamline the disclosure
process in a manner consistent with customer protection. For example, in 1985, the Commission adopted Rule 4.5, which,
as last amended,

12

 provides an exclusion from the definition of the term ``commodity pool operator'' for the operators of specified
types of collective investment vehicles operating pursuant to other regulatory frameworks, 

i.e.

, certain pension plans, registered investment companies, bank or trust company collective funds and insurance
company separate accounts, whose use of futures and commodity option transactions is limited to hedging and to non-hedging
transactions for which initial margin deposits and option premiums do not exceed five percent of the liquidation
value of the entity's portfolio.







In 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.12(b), which provides relief from certain requirements of Rules 4.21, 4.22
and 4.23 with respect to pools that commit no more than ten percent of the fair market value of their assets to establish
commodity interest positions and trade such commodity interests in a manner solely incidental to their securities
trading. Also in 1987, the Commission adopted Rule 4.14(a)(8), which provides registration relief to investment
advisers registered as such with the SEC, who provide commodity interest trading advice to trading vehicles that
are excluded from the definition of the term ``pool'' under Rule 4.5 or are qualifying entities for which a notice of
eligibility has been filed under Rule 4.5, provided that the investment adviser's commodity interest trading advice
is solely incidental to the adviser's business of providing securities advice and consistent with Rule 4.5, and that
the investment adviser does not otherwise hold itself out as a CTA. 


In August 1992, the Commission adopted Rule 4.7, which provides relief from certain part 4 requirements to CPOs offering
pool participations and to CTAs offering managed accounts to certain highly accredited investors.

14

 Rule 4.7 also facilitates multi-jurisdictional offerings by making relief available for private offerings exempt
from registration pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and pursuant to the
SEC's Regulation S
 and by including certain foreign persons as eligible participants in pools qualifying for Rule 4.7 exemption.

16

 







In addition, the Division of Trading and Markets (``Division'') has issued relief on a case-by-case basis to facilitate
application of the disclosure requirements in the context of new market conditions not contemplated by the existing
regulatory framework, such as multiple CTA and fund-of-funds structures, with the objective of fostering clear
and succinct disclosure of material information, especially concerning fees and the manner in which proceeds of
the offering will be used. In many cases, strict application of existing disclosure requirements to pools whose CPOs
have voluminous performance histories or which retain multiple CTAs or invest in multiple investee funds may result
in such extensive track record disclosure that past performance records generally may be given undue emphasis and
the most germane data given insufficient prominence. These effects have been mitigated in appropriate circumstances
through grants of exemptive or no-action relief. For example, in Interpretative Letter No. 92-12,

17

 the Division granted relief from required disclosures (including disclosure of past performance records) concerning
CTAs and investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets of the investor pool. The CPO had an operating
history of more than three years and changed the pools' CTAs frequently based on its continuous analysis of over 500
CTAs. This relief has since been made available to other CPOs in similar circumstances. 





In Interpretative Letter 94-10, the Division granted relief permitting a CPO to use a summary format containing
specified core information to present, in the disclosure document of a single-advisor pool, its past performance
with respect to other pools operated by the CPO, none of which was advised by the same CTA as the single-advisor pool.
The CTA advising the single-advisor pool had a ten-year track record that would be fully disclosed in the disclosure
document of the single-advisor pool and the full performance record of the CPO's other pools would be available upon
request.

In Interpretative Letter No. 92-9,

19

 the Division permitted a CPO to use a two-part disclosure document for a commodity pool provided, among other things,
that both parts of the disclosure document were delivered at the same time and that the first part of the document contained
all of the disclosures required by Rule 4.21 except for the disclosures required by Rule 4.21(a)(5) with respect to
the performance records of the pool's CTAs, which were required to be included in the second part. By Advisory 27-92
(June 3, 1992), the Division gave notice that it had no objection to the use of a two-part disclosure document of the
nature described above by other CPOs, subject to the conditions set forth in the foregoing letter. 





In reviewing CPO disclosure documents, Division staff has addressed fund-of-funds structures by requiring that
certain disclosures be made with respect to investee pools but limiting these disclosures with respect to investee
pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered.

20

 The Division has also issued interpretative statements and advisories giving guidance with respect to the presentation
of past performance in disclosure documents.

21

 






In developing this proposal, the Commission has taken into account its experience in administering the current regulatory
framework, reviewing disclosure documents and responding to requests for relief from registrants. The Commission
has also taken into consideration the evolution of the industry, the views of the public and of market participants
and the disclosure implications of recently developed trading structures. 

The Commission also has had the benefit of the work of a Special Committee for the Review of CPO/CTA Disclosure Issues
established by the National Futures Association (``NFA'')
 to review and make recommendations concerning CPO and CTA disclosure documents. The Special Committee's recommendations
were presented to NFA's Board of Directors in February 1994. On March 15, 1994, the NFA submitted to the Commission
proposed amendments to, and interpretations of, its Compliance Rules which were based upon the Special Committee's
recommendations. NFA's rule submission consists of several parts. Proposed revisions of NFA Compliance Rule 2-13(a)
would require CPOs to comply, not only with specified Commission rules applicable to CPOs' and CTAs' activities and
disclosures, but also with interpretations of those rules issued by NFA's Board of Directors and approved by the Commission.
Separately, new paragraph (b) would be added to Compliance Rule 2-13 to require CPO disclosure documents to
include a ``break-even'' analysis, 

i.e.

, a computation of the trading profit that a pool must realize in its first year for a participant to recoup its initial
investment, presented in the manner prescribed by the NFA's Board of Directors, including a tabular presentation
of fees and expenses. NFA is also proposing interpretations of proposed Compliance Rule 2-13 relating to disclosure
of past performance information, the computation and presentation of the break-even analysis, the use of pro forma
and extracted results in past performance presentations and other topics addressed by this proposal, including
the disclosure of business backgrounds of CPO and CTA principals, material litigation against FCMs and other past
performance issues. In addition, NFA is proposing to replace paragraph (b)(4) of NFA Rule 2-29 with a new, more
detailed, paragraph (c) concerning the use of hypothetical trading results. References to the NFA proposal are made
in appropriate sections of this release.

23

 Certain portions of that proposal are being published for comment contemporaneously with this release. The NFA submission
is available from the Commission's Office of the Secretariat. 





The Commission is exploring possible mechanisms for addressing CPO and CTA disclosure issues with the benefit of
industry and other external input on an ongoing basis.

III. Section-by-Section Analysis 



Current Rule 4.21 would be reorganized with a view towards simplification of presentation. Rule 4.21 would continue
to require CPOs to deliver a disclosure document. New Rule 4.24 sets forth general disclosure requirements, 

i.e.

, requirements applicable to disclosure of all matters other than past performance. Past performance disclosure
requirements would be codified in new Rule 4.25. New Rule 4.26 would contain requirements with respect to the use,
amendment and filing of the disclosure document.

24

 




A. Section 4.25_Performance Disclosures 



Simplification of past performance disclosure requirements has been a primary objective of this rulemaking. The
proposed revisions of the past performance disclosure requirements are predicated upon the view that past performance
is not predictive of future performance results and that inclusion of multiple performance records in disclosure
documents may tend to give undue importance to past performance data. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that
past performance disclosure may serve to reveal negative performance results and the volatility of pool returns.
Consequently, the Commission is proposing to substantially simplify past performance requirements with the objective
of eliminating required disclosure of past performance that is of secondary relevance to the pool offered. 

The proposed rules are designed to foster clarity and simplicity. This objective would be achieved in part by substituting
a summary of core performance data for the multicolumnar presentations called for under current rules. This new ``capsule''
format, which has recently been used by some CPOs pursuant to exemptive relief issued by the Division of Trading and
Markets on a case-by-case basis,

25

 provides a simple, readable and succinct overview of pool performance and substantially reduces the overall quantity
of performance data required to be presented without sacrificing the elements important to customers.

<TEXT>
 

The past performance disclosure requirements have also been comprehensively reviewed and revised with a view towards
eliminating or reducing past performance disclosures of secondary importance. As a result, the primary focus of
past performance disclosure would be the performance of the pool offered and for most pools with less than a three year
operating history, upon pools of a similar nature. Only the past performance records of CTAs with responsibility
for managing substantial amounts of a pool's futures or commodity option trading would be required. The performance
of CTAs managing lesser amounts of the pool's futures trading and other performance data of secondary relevance to
the offering would generally not be required except to the extent that such performance was below a specified benchmark
rate of return or resulted in significant losses. The performance of pools dissimilar to the pool offered would be
permitted to be shown in composites, subject to limitations on the types of pools that may be included in a composite.


The proposed rules also take into account structures in which a trading manager, rather than the pool's CPO, allocates
pool assets, and fund-of-funds structures. In addition, because, under the proposal, the volume of required performance
disclosures would be considerably reduced, the time period for these disclosures would be increased from three to
five years to provide pool participants with a better chronological perspective of the track records presented in
the disclosure document.






Thus, the proposed past performance requirements require presentation of the past performance of the pool itself.
For most pools with at least a three-year track record this would be the only past performance required to be disclosed.
Proposed Rule 4.25(c) would require the following additional disclosures with respect to pools with less than a three-year
history. If the pool has not commenced trading, a short statement to that effect would be required to be prominently
disclosed. The performance of the CPO (or of the pool's trading manager, if applicable) would be required to be disclosed
and if the CPO (trading manager) had less than a three-year trading history, the performance of its trading principals
also would be required.
 If applicable, a legend would be required to disclose the fact that neither the CPO (or trading manager), nor its principals
has any commodity interest trading experience. 





With respect to CTAs and investee pools, proposed Rule 4.25(c)(3) would provide for disclosure of the performance
of ``major'' CTAs and investee pools, 

i.e.

, CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's aggregate initial futures margins and commodity option
premiums and investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's assets, to be set forth in the specified
capsule format. The CPO would only be required to indicate any ``adverse performance'' as defined in proposed Rule
4.25(a)(8) on the part of CTAs allocated less than twenty-five but at least ten percent of the pool's futures margins
and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent but at least ten percent
of the assets of the pool offered. No performance disclosure would be required for CTAs allocated less than ten percent
of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums or investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the
pool's assets. If a major CTA or investee pool had no experience in trading commodity interests, a prominent legend
would be required to so indicate. The legend would also indicate the percentage of futures margins and option premiums
allocated to the particular CTA or pool assets allocated to the investee pool. 

Past performance disclosure requirements would be codified in Rule 4.25, which would contain three sections. Paragraph
(a) would set forth general principles applicable to pool performance disclosure; paragraph (b) would set forth
the requirements applicable to pools with three or more years history; and paragraph (c) would address other pools.
 The proposed changes are more fully described below.

1. Capsule Performance Presentation 



Rule 4.21(a)(4) currently requires performance to be disclosed in tables showing at least quarterly the beginning
and ending net asset values for the period, all additions, withdrawals and redemptions, whether voluntary or involuntary,
the net performance for the period, net of additions, withdrawals and redemptions, and the rate of return for the period.
These requirements have been applied in practice such that multiple pages of small-type numerical tables, frequently
including performance data not required by Commission rules, are presented, often mixing without differentiation
the performance of trading vehicles similar to the pool offered and of vehicles different in material respects. Such
performance presentations are voluminous and may give equal weight to relevant data and to data of secondary or marginal
pertinence. 

The Commission is proposing a new summary format for presentation of all required past performance history.
 This format is intended to capture the most significant information concerning a pool's history in a reader-friendly,
largely nontabular form, which would generally permit multiple performance track records to be provided on a single
page. The proposed new format, which is set forth in Rule 4.25(a)(1)(i) for pools and Rule 4.25(a)(1)(ii) for accounts,
calls for core information intended to convey relevant data in a condensed format. The capsule format for pools would
set forth the date when the pool commenced trading, the aggregate gross capital subscriptions for the pool, and the
pool's current net asset value. The ``largest monthly draw-down'' and ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down''
are intended to show that material changes in rates of return may occur. Rates of return would also be included, on a
monthly basis for the pool offered, and on an annual basis for other pools. 





The ``largest monthly drawn-down'' and the ``worst continuous peak-to-valley draw-down'' would demonstrate the
significant one-month and sustained declines to which commodity pool returns may be subject. Both draw-down figures
would be expressed as a percentage of the pool's net asset value. The largest monthly draw-down would indicate the
largest net asset loss experienced by the pool in any calendar month and the month and year in which it occurred. The
peak-to-valley draw-down would indicate the largest calendar month-to-calendar month continuous net asset loss
experienced by the pool during any period and the months and year in which it occurred. Dating the monthly and peak-to-valley
draw-downs would permit participants to assess whether the losses were connected to market conditions by comparing
the draw-downs of several pools. As explained in the rule, a peak-to-valley draw-down of 4 to 8-91/25% would
indicate that the peak-to-valley lasted from April to August of 1991 and resulted in a twenty-five percent draw-down
of the pool's net asset value. 

The rate of return would be presented for each month for the pool offered and for each year for other pools. It would be
computed on a monthly compounded basis in order that the rate of return for a given month will take into account the prior
months' trading profits. Annual rates of return computed on a monthly compounded basis assume reinvestment of accrued
profits and therefore the investment base on which rates of return are calculated is effectively adjusted by these
amounts, presenting a more accurate picture of actual returns realized on an investment. Information currently
required by Rule 4.21(a)(4) concerning additions, withdrawals and redemptions, the beginning and ending net asset
values and the number of units outstanding at the end of each period at least for each quarter, would not be required.


The proposed capsule format for CTA accounts would contain similar core information, 

i.e.,

 the name of the CTA or other person trading the account and the name of the trading program; the date when the CTA began
trading client funds and the date of inception of the program being disclosed; the number of accounts in the program;
the total assets under the management of the CTA and in the trading program; the largest monthly and worst continuous
peak-to-valley draw-downs for the program; and the annual and year-to-date rates of return. Registrants who compute
rates of return for CTA programs on the basis permitted by Advisory 93-13 would continue to be required to state
the actual and nominal account sizes, as required therein.
 





The summary format is designed for presentation purposes only. CPOs and CTAs must continue to compute pool performance
on the basis set forth in current Rule 4.21(a)(4)(ii) (proposed to be renumbered as Rule 4.25(a)(6)), as interpreted
by the Commission and to maintain records substantiating such computations in accordance with Rule 1.31.
 





An example of capsule past performance presentation follows. This table sets forth on a single page capsule past performance
for eight pools.

2. Pools With Three or More Years Operating History 



Current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of its CTAs and their principals
for all pools. If the pool offered has less than a twelve-month track record, the performance of the CPO and of each of
its principals must also be disclosed. Under the proposed rules, past performance disclosure requirements would
differ based on whether the pool had a three-year, rather than twelve-month, track record. Generally, where a pool
has at least a three-year track record, the only performance required to be disclosed would be that of the pool offered.


The Commission believes that, generally, where a pool has an extensive operational history, presentation of the
pool's own past performance record should fulfill the objectives of past performance disclosure. If, however, the
pool's historical track record occurred under materially different conditions, the track record of the pool alone
may not be sufficient. For example, if the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle investing a relatively
small amount of funds contributed by third party sources, the track record generated may have little or no relevance
to a publicly offered pool. To assure that a pool's three-year history was not acquired under circumstances in which
the pool was essentially a proprietary trading vehicle, proposed Rule 4.25(b) would provide for past performance
disclosure to be limited to that of the pool offered for pools that have traded commodity futures and option contracts
for at least three years with no fewer than fifteen participants who are unaffiliated with the pool's CPO and in which
no more than ten percent of the assets were contributed by the CPO. The pool's performance would be required to be disclosed
for five full calendar years and year-to-date (or, if the pool had less than a five-year history, for the pool's entire
operating history), in the specified capsule format with monthly rates of return. The CPO would be free to include
additional performance records in compliance with the provision relating to voluntary information. 

The Commission requests comment as to whether the performance record of a pool with a three-year operating history
is generally sufficient without supplementary performance data concerning the pool's CTAs or other pools operated
by the CPO. The Commission also requests comment as to whether the offered pool's operating history should be considered
for purposes of the three-year minimum if such history was acquired when the pool differed in some material respect
from the pool as offered, for example, in cases in which the pool's CTA, types of interests traded or the trading program
have been significantly modified or the pool was initially privately offered but is now offered to the public. 



3. Pools With Less Than Three Years History 



As noted above, current Rule 4.21(a)(4) requires a pool disclosure document to disclose the performance of the pool
offered, of each of the pool's CTAs and of each principal of the CTAs, and, if the pool offered has traded commodity interests
for less than twelve months, the performance of the CPO and each of its principals. 

As discussed in the preceding section, the Commission is proposing to limit required performance disclosures to
the performance of the pool offered if the pool has at least a three-year performance history. With respect to pools
that have less than a three-year history, proposed Rule 4.25(c) would require presentation of the performance records
of the pool offered, the CPO (or trading manager), the CPO's (or trading manager's) trading principals if the CPO (or
trading manager) has less than a three-year history, and the performance of each ``major'' CTA and investee pool,
i.e., CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and
investee pools allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of the pool offered.

32

 For CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and
investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's assets, the sole requirement would be to indicate
any ``adverse'' performance as defined in the rule. No disclosure would be required for CTAs allocated less than ten
percent of the pool's futures margins and option premiums or investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the
pool's assets.

The proposed rules would require that the performance history for the pool offered be presented before any other performance
history in the disclosure document. The performance of pools similar to the pool offered would be presented after
that of the pool offered, on a pool-by-pool basis. 
The performance disclosure requirement of current Rule 4.21(a)(4) focuses on the past performance of the pool offered,
its CTAs, principals of the CTAs and, if the pool has less than a year history, the CPO and each of its principals. As noted
above, these requirements would be largely eliminated for pools with at least a three-year operating history. For
pools with a shorter history, additional past performance records would be required to be disclosed. These requirements
were devised to focus upon the performance of pools similar to the pool offered and of persons responsible for management
of a significant portion of the offered pool's assets. Further, to the extent that performance of principals is required,
unlike the current rule which requires disclosure of the performance of all principals, the proposed rule would require
disclosure of the past performance of ``trading principals'' only. A ``trading principal'' would be defined in proposed
Rule 4.10(m) to mean a principal of a CPO or CTA who participates in making commodity interest trading decisions for
a pool or client or who supervises, or has authority to allocate pool assets to, persons so engaged. 

The proposed rules also would take into account arrangements in which pools use trading managers to direct their trading.

33

 The term ``trading manager'' is defined in proposed Rule 4.10(j) as any person, other than the pool's CPO, with authority
to allocate pool assets to CTAs or investee pools. 





As noted above, the practice of retaining trading managers to select and monitor the performance of CTAs and investee
pools to which pool assets will be committed has become commonplace. CPOs seek to maximize pool returns by allocating
pool assets based on analysis of the returns achieved by CTAs retained for the pool and investee pools in which the pool
has invested as compared to those of other CTAs and investee pools, and in response to changing market conditions.
CPOs frequently rely on trading managers to continuously review the performance of CTAs and investee pools and allocate
and reallocate pool funds. Because the trading manager, rather than the CPO, conducts the asset allocation activities
for the pool, the Commission believes that the principal focus of the performance disclosure for a pool in which a trading
manager is responsible for allocating the assets should be on the trading manager, rather than the CPO. Thus, when
a pool has a trading manager, the trading manager's performance would replace that of the CPO. 

With respect to CTAs, the proposed rules would require disclosure of the past performance of CTAs only where they manage
twenty-five percent or more of the pool's futures and commodity option trading and thus would constitute ``major
CTAs,'' as defined in proposed Rule 4.10(k). The proposed rules also would require disclosure of past performance
of investee pools constituting ``major investee pools, that is investee pools allocated twenty-five percent or
more of the pool's assets. The term ``major CTA'' would be defined in Rule 4.10(k) to mean a CTA allocated or intended
to be allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's initial margins for futures contracts and premiums for commodity
options. Proposed Rule 4.10(l) would define ``major investee pool'' as an investee pool allocated or intended to
be allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of a pool. These definitions are intended to include CTAs or
investee pools to whom the CPO of a pool that has not commenced trading intends to make allocations at or above the specified
thresholds. Similarly, CTAs and investee pools to whom the CPO of an operating pool intends to reallocate assets such
that the allocations will total twenty-five percent or more under the margin or total asset standards also would be
included. 

To further reduce the volume of performance data contained in the disclosure document, the proposed rules would eliminate
the requirement to present performance data with respect to CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's
initial margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the
pool's assets and require only that ``adverse'' performance be disclosed as to CTAs allocated ten percent or more
of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated ten percent or more
of the pool's assets. ``Adverse performance'' would be defined in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(8) as an annual rate of return
of one hundred basis points less than the ninety-day Treasury Bill rate on December 31 of the calendar year in which
the performance occurred or the termination of any pool pursuant to a loss termination provision. To disclose adverse
performance, the CPO would indicate the year in which the performance occurred, the rate of return for that year, and
the name of the CPO, CTA or investee pool responsible for the performance. An indication of adverse performance would
be required to be given for the pool's CPO (where the pool had a trading manager whose performance was disclosed in lieu
of that of the CPO), any trading principal of the CPO or trading manager whose performance was not otherwise disclosed,
any CTA, other than a major CTA, allocated at least ten percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity
option premiums and any investee pool, other than a major investee pool, allocated at least ten percent of the assets
of the pool offered and the trading principals of major CTAs and the CPOs of major investee pools that have no prior operating
history. Proposed Rule 4.25(c)(3)(iii) would permit CPOs to provide capsule performance in lieu of giving an indication
of adverse performance.

Comment is requested concerning the proposed treatment of CTA and investee pool performance, including the definitions
of major CTA and major investee pools. In particular, commenters may wish to address whether use of a twenty-five percent
of futures margin or commodity premium benchmark as compared to twenty-five percent of total assets adequately reflects
the relative risks of direct futures trading as compared to trading through vehicles which limit the risk of loss to
the initial investment. Comment also is requested as to the definition of adverse performance, in particular, as
to whether any additional benchmarks for identifying whether past performance is sufficiently ``adverse'' to warrant
disclosure would be appropriate. For example, should the adverse performance definition be revised to include a
one-month draw-down exceeding a specified percentage, e.g., twenty-five percent, of account equity traded pursuant
to the trading program under which the CTA will trade for the offered pool. 



4. Past Performance Disclosure in CTA Disclosure Documents 




CTA disclosure documents would be required to include the past performance of the CTA and its trading principals.
The past performance of the program offered would be required to be disclosed in the full format currently required.
For other programs, the CTA would be required to use the capsule format used by CPOs to present CTA past performance
in pool disclosure documents. 



5. Updating Past Performance Records 




Concurrently, Rule 4.22(a) is proposed to be revised by adding paragraph (a)(4) to require periodic account statements
to include the names of all of the pool's CTAs and investee pools regardless of the amount of pool assets allocated to
them. In addition, to provide a ready means of presenting the performance of newly added major CTAs and investee pools,
account statements would be required to include the past performance of all CTAs and investee pools that are major
CTAs and major investee pools as of the date of the statements and whose performance was not previously disclosed.
Use of account statements to update major CTAs' and investee pools' performance records would provide a convenient
means for CPOs to amend pool performance disclosures. In the event that the pool acquired a new major CTA or investee
pool whose past performance had not previously been disclosed, the CPO would be required to notify pool participants
of such event and provide the relevant performance records as required by proposed Rule 4.26(c) (current Rule 4.21(b)),

34

 within twenty-one calendar days after the CPO knows or should know of this occurrence, whether by way of the account
statement (if this would provide timely notice under the twenty-one day requirement) or by other similar means. 





6. Time Period for Which Past Performance Disclosure Would be Required 




Current Rule 4.21 generally requires past performance to be presented for a three-year period. However, the Commission
is aware that some registrants nonetheless include longer performance periods in their disclosure documents for
marketing purposes. The Commission believes that requiring performance to be disclosed for a period longer than
three years will have the benefit of making performance disclosures more uniform and will provide a better picture
of the evolution of performance over time, including positive and negative fluctuations in returns. In addition,
under the proposed summary format for performance disclosure, lengthy tables to present performance data would
not be required. Consequently, adoption of a five-year disclosure period would not result in any significant increase
in the volume of performance disclosures. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to increase the minimum time
period for which performance would be disclosed from three to five years. CPOs may continue to provide additional
performance disclosures provided the performance is calculated in compliance with proposed Rule 4.25 and is included
in the document following the required performance disclosures as required by proposed Rule 4.24(v) for information
voluntarily provided. 

A summary table of the proposed past performance disclosure requirements follows.

7. Composite Performance Presentations 


Rule 4.21(a)(4)(iv) currently permits the performance of pools operated by each person for whom performance is required
to be disclosed to be presented on a composite basis provided that the performance of the pool offered is separately
disclosed, the CPO describes how each composite was developed, and the composite is not misleading. Rule 4.31 also
permits composite presentation of the performance of accounts directed by the CTA and each of its principals provided
that material differences among the accounts and the manner in which the composite was developed are described. 
Composite presentations have the obvious advantage of reducing the volume of past performance data presented. However,
composite presentations raise a number of regulatory concerns precisely because they supplant individualized
presentations of potentially quite different types of pools and trading programs and may smooth or camouflage actual
rates of return. Composite results not only fail to reflect differences among the pools and accounts whose results
are presented but also merge potentially disparate trading results into average trading results and thus fail to
reflect the actual dispersion of returns as well as the volatility of individual pools and accounts. For these reasons,
the Commission considered prohibiting the use of composite performance data for pools as well as accounts. 
The Commission has carefully considered the benefits and disadvantages that may accrue from the use of composites
and is proposing an approach designed to realize the benefits of reducing the volume of performance data created by
the use of composites while reducing the potential for misleading result presentations. Under the proposal, past
performance data for the pool offered and pools similar to the pool offered would be required to be separately disclosed.
Pools of a different type from the pool offered would be permitted to be presented in composites with other pools of
the same type, provided that such presentations would not be misleading. Pools would be considered to be of a different
type or category if they differed in material respects. The proposed rule delineates several types of material distinctions
among pools for this purpose, including the following: Pools privately offered pursuant to Regulation D of the Securities
Act and public pools; pools traded with materially different leverages; limited risk pools and non-limited risk
pools; pools using different commodity or trading methodologies; and multi-advisor pools
 and non-multi-advisor pools. 




A pool could be included in a composite with another pool only if both pools were of the same type with respect to each
of these categories. For example, a publicly offered non-multi-advisor pool could not be included in the same composite
as a privately offered non-multi-advisor pool and two limited risk pools that used different trading programs or
materially different degrees of leverage could not be included in the same composite. Moreover, there may be instances
in which even composites of pools of the same type may be misleading, such as where differences between the trading
results of the pools are so great that a composite would materially distort their results. For example, two publicly
offered multi-advisor pools with the same CTAs could show widely disparate results unless each CTA were allocated
substantially the same portion of each pool's assets. Also, two single-advisor pools with different CTAs may achieve
very different results. The proviso in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii) that results may be presented in composite form
``unless such presentation would be misleading'' is intended to assure that composites are carefully reviewed to
protect against any material distortion that may result from these types of situations. 
Proposed Rules 4.25(a)(6) and 4.34(a)(2) would require that records substantiating the performance data set forth
in CPO and CTA documents, respectively, and documenting the underlying calculations be maintained in accordance
with Rule 1.31. Naturally, this requirement also applies with respect to composite presentations. Pursuant to proposed
Rule 4.25(a)(3)(ii), a CPO must be prepared to justify the inclusion in a composite of the pool results contained therein.

To present capsule performance of pools in a composite, the CPO would name all pools included in the composite, set
forth the categories of these pools (which, as discussed above, would be the same for each pool in the composite), including
at a minimum the categories specified in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii), and specify the dates on which each pool commenced
trading. The aggregate gross capital subscriptions would be the total subscriptions for all pools in the composite.
The draw-down figures would be the worst experienced by any one of the pools included in the composite and the rate of
return would be the average rate of return for all pools included. The sample capsule past performance presentation
table set forth above following the discussion on capsule performance includes an example of performance presentation
for pools (pools A and B, in the example) whose performance is disclosed in composite form. 
The Commission requests comment as to whether the pool categories delineated in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(3)(iii) relating
to composite presentations are appropriate for purposes of limiting composite presentations and as to whether any
additional categories of pools should be identified for this purpose. Comment is also requested as to the costs and
benefits of a general requirement of separate rather than composite presentation of pool performance in lieu of a
qualified approach of the nature proposed.

Proposed Rule 4.34(a)(5) would permit CTAs to include in a composite all accounts traded pursuant to the same trading
program, provided that such a presentation would not be misleading and provided that the CTA describes how the composite
was calculated. The term ``trading program'' would be defined in the rule as ``a trading strategy differentiated
from others by commodity trading methodology, degree of risk or degree of leverage.'' Comment is requested as to the
necessity and feasibility of providing a more detailed definition of the term ``trading program'' or additional
guidance as to how trading programs can be differentiated. 


8. Proprietary Trading Results 


Use of proprietary trading results in soliciting customer accounts is a practice which has long been of concern to
the Commission. CPOs and CTAs may trade proprietary funds for a variety of purposes, including to test a new trading
strategy before implementing it for customer funds or to establish a track record prior to trading customer funds.
However, proprietary accounts may be traded in a different manner, for example, more aggressively, using higher
leverage and assuming greater risk, than customer accounts. Also, proprietary accounts are usually not subject
to the same fee schedule as customer accounts. Naturally, no management or incentive fee would apply where a CTA traded
its own account, and clearing fees may be waived or reduced if the account is cleared by an affiliate. In addition, where
proprietary and customer assets are combined for purposes of performance presentations, the total amount of assets
under management is inflated and conceals the actual amount of customer funds being traded. For these reasons, proprietary
trading results may, in many cases, be of little relevance to a prospective pool participant or CTA client and actually
misleading in others. 
Currently, the Commission's rules do not specifically address the use of proprietary trading results in disclosure
documents. However, in reviewing disclosure documents, because the rules require performance of ``directed accounts''
and because of the prohibition against misleading disclosures, Division staff have advised that any proprietary
trading results provided must be clearly labeled as such and presented in a separate table to reduce the potential
for misleading investors. The staff also has required that if fees, expenses, commissions, margin-to-equity ratios,
or any other item pertaining to the proprietary trading is materially different from that relevant to the trading
program offered to clients, the registrant must ``pro forma'' such items to correspond to those in the program offered.

In reviewing the Part 4 rules, the Commission considered prohibiting the use of proprietary results in CPO and CTA
disclosure documents given the potentially misleading nature of such presentations and their at best marginal relevance
in the non-proprietary trading context. However, the Commission is aware that proprietary trading results may be
the only performance results available to some new traders to present to customers as evidence of trading experience.
Accordingly, rather than prohibiting disclosure of proprietary trading results, the Commission is proposing to
permit such disclosure under appropriate restrictions. Under proposed Rule 4.25(a)(9), pools and accounts in which
the pool operator, trading manager, CTA or other person providing services to the pool owned or controlled fifty percent
or more of the beneficial interest could not be included in disclosure documents unless prominently labeled as such
and set forth following all required performance and non-performance disclosures. The requirement that proprietary
results follow all required disclosures, rather than just the required performance disclosures, would reflect
the peripheral and potentially misleading nature of proprietary trading results and reduce the potential for confusion
of proprietary and customer trading results.

36

 




9. Pro Forma, Hypothetical and Extracted Results 


The Commission also recognizes the potential for inappropriate use of certain other types of performance data. These
include hypothetical, pro forma and extracted results. Hypothetical results are results calculated based upon
the application of a given program to historical market prices and purport to present results that could have been
obtained in trading a particular program during the specified historical period. Thus, hypothetical results are
based on hindsight and can be readily manipulated. Rule 4.41 requires that any presentation of simulated or hypothetical
trading results be accompanied by a specified cautionary statement describing the limited value of such results.
In its rule submission, the NFA notes that a number of NFA disciplinary cases have involved NFA members who advertise
hypothetical results to solicit unsophisticated customers. When the trading program is unsuccessful and causes
substantial customer losses, the program is abandoned in favor of a new program for which hypothetical results, based
on hindsight, are presented. The actual performance of customers whose accounts were traded under the prior program
may never be disclosed.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Pro forma results present trading results with adjustments to reflect certain factors, such as a particular fee schedule
or degree of leverage, to permit easier comparison with other types of results. In its rule submission, the NFA notes
that in some instances the use of pro forma results may have some of the same limitations as hypothetical results. For
example, some CPOs may use pro forma data to present results that a multi-advisor pool could have achieved had assets
been allocated differently among CTAs than occurred in actuality. As the NFA Special Committee concluded, ``[t]his
use of pro forma results reflects the same sort of hindsight that hypothetical results do and invites the same sort
of abuse.'' 

Extracted performance results isolate a single component of a trading strategy for presentation to customers, and
although based on actual results, are subject to manipulation as they may disproportionately emphasize a small portion
of the overall strategy.

Although the Commission believes that the use of pro forma, hypothetical and extracted results must be closely scrutinized,
it has determined not to prohibit them at the present time. Instead, like other disclosures voluntarily provided,
the disclosure of these types of results would be subject to such restrictions as may be imposed under the rules of a
registered futures association and to the Commission's general antifraud prohibitions. NFA's proposed Compliance
Rule 2-29(c) would strictly limit the use of hypothetical results in promotional material, except in promotional
material directed exclusively to qualified eligible participants, as defined in CFTC Rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii). NFA's
proposed interpretation of Compliance Rule 2-13 would permit pro forma performance histories solely for the
purpose of adjusting performance presentations to the same fee structure as that of the pool or program offered. No
pro forma results which reflect a hindsight analysis, such as to show results a multi-advisor pool could have achieved
using a different allocation of assets among CTAs, would be permitted. Extracted results would only be permitted
to be presented based on the percentage of net asset value actually committed to the particular component extracted.




10. Voluntary Performance Disclosures 



Pursuant to proposed Rule 4.24(v), disclosures, including performance disclosures, other than those required
by CFTC rules must follow all relevant required disclosures in the disclosure document

 and may not be misleading in their content or presentation or inconsistent with required disclosures.
 Performance disclosures voluntarily provided could have misleading effects if favorable performance data are
given undue prominence. For example, if the performance of two pools other than the offered pool operated by the CPO
were voluntarily provided, it may be misleading to show the favorable performance of Pool 1 but not the negative performance
of Pool 2 or to show the performance of Pool 1 in capsule format and that of Pool 2 in full format. It may also be misleading
to show the performance of a pool in capsule format for year one and in full format for year two or to show the pool's performance
for 1991 and not 1992. Generally, inclusion of voluntarily provided performance data should be made on a result-neutral
basis that results in inclusion of all similar data. For example, the past performance of two CTAs allocated an equal
portion of a pool's assets should either be included or omitted, as should the performance of the CPO's other pools.







The Commission also notes that the practice of advertising the performance of a particular CTA with an excellent track
record to attract prospective participants and shortly thereafter reallocating pool assets to another CTA, a practice
commonly referred to as ``bait-and-switch,'' is misleading and that performance voluntarily provided for this
purpose is prohibited under general antifraud standards. 



11. Cautionary Legends 



The proposed rules would continue to require the inclusion of certain legends alerting pool participants and prospective
participants to the lack of experience of the CPO (or trading manager), the pool's CTAs and their principals. However,
these legends have been revised and substantially streamlined. Under current Rule 4.21, these legends are required
to recite the relevant performance disclosure requirement. For example, Rule 4.21(4)(i)(B) requires a statement
that the CFTC requires disclosure of the performance of the pool offered and of other pools operated by the CPO and its
principals and that neither the CPO nor its principals have any prior performance history.
 The proposed rules would eliminate the prescribed statements concerning CFTC rules, with the effect of deleting
the bulk of the bold-faced disclosures and of focusing attention upon the primary point to be conveyed, 

i.e., 

the fact that the CPO and its principals have not previously operated any commodity pools. Thus, the legend relating
to the lack of trading history of a pool would read: ``THIS POOL HAS NOT COMMENCED TRADING AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY PERFORMANCE
HISTORY'',
 and the legend relating to the lack of experience of the CPO and its trading principals would read: ``NEITHER THIS POOL
OPERATOR NOR ANY OF ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAS PREVIOUSLY OPERATED ANY OTHER POOLS OR TRADED ANY OTHER ACCOUNTS.''

 Similar legends would be required, where applicable, with respect to trading managers and major investee pools.
To further reduce the bulk of these disclosures, where several legends may be required, the proposed rules provide
an alternate legend consolidating the several statements that would otherwise be required. For example, the proposed
rules would require a CTA disclosure document to disclose, if true, the lack of experience of the CTA and its principals.
If the CTA had no prior experience, the following legend should be included: ``THIS TRADING ADVISOR PREVIOUSLY HAS
NOT DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' The following legend would be used for trading principals: ``NONE OF THE TRADING PRINCIPALS
OF THIS TRADING ADVISOR HAS PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' If neither the CTA nor any of its principals had prior
trading experience, rather than displaying these two separate legends, the following single sentence would be included:
``NEITHER THIS TRADING ADVISOR NOR ITS TRADING PRINCIPALS HAVE PREVIOUSLY DIRECTED ANY ACCOUNTS.'' These proposals
are designed to reduce disclosures that complicate and lengthen disclosure documents while preserving disclosures
that may be important to prospective investors.

<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A legend indicating that ``PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT PREDICTIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE'' would be required to precede
any performance presentation, whether required or given voluntarily.
 





12. Order of Disclosures 



For pools with an operating history shorter than three years, the performance of the pool offered would be required
to be the first performance record presented in the disclosure document. Performance data for pools of the same category
as the pool offered would be required to appear after the performance history of the pool offered and to be presented
on a pool-by-pool, that is non-composite, basis. Pools of a different category from the pool offered would be required
to follow the performance of pools of the same category as the pool offered. As discussed above, for purposes of applying
the requirement that composite presentations be used only for pools of the same category, the rule would identify
a number of categories of pools. 

The Commission believes that the streamlined past performance disclosure requirements should substantially increase
the clarity and readability of past performance disclosures. 

The Commission requests comment on all aspects of Rule 4.25 and, in particular, on the adequacy of the summary performance
format to provide a basis upon which a prospective pool participant may make an informed judgment with respect to past
performance results; whether a three-year history is a sufficient basis for eliminating any requirement for disclosure
of past performance other than that of the pool offered; and whether the ten percent allocation thresholds for major
CTAs and investee pools, below which no performance disclosures would be required, is appropriate. The Commission
also requests comment as to whether past performance presentations would provide more meaningful information if
they were required to include rates of return on a risk-adjusted basis, that is, reduced by the relevant Treasury Bill
rate or comparable interest figure, or to break out trading results from passive interest income. 



B. Section 4.24_Required General Disclosures 



Under the proposal, non-performance disclosure requirements would be set forth in Rule 4.24. 



1. Table of Contents and Order of Required Information 



As noted above, a primary objective of this proposal is to foster clarity and comprehensibility in the disclosure
of relevant information to prospective pool participants. To this end, in addition to eliminating certain required
disclosures, the Commission is proposing that certain information be presented in a required sequence which would
be specified in proposed Rules 4.24(a) through (d). Like current Rule 4.21, proposed Rule 4.24 would require that
a cautionary statement, 

i.e., 

a statement that the CFTC has not passed upon the merits of the pool investment or the adequacy of the disclosure document,
and any other information required under any other applicable federal or state laws and regulations, appear on the
cover page of the disclosure document. The risk disclosure statement specified in Rule 4.24(b) would be required
to be set forth immediately after these disclosures. The next item in the disclosure document would be a table of contents.
 Prior to any detailed disclosures with respect to the pool and persons involved in operating and trading the assets
of the pool, in what would constitute the ``forepart'' of the disclosure document, a prospective participant would
find very basic information concerning the pool.
 This information would include the name and address of the pool and CPO; the type of pool being offered, 

i.e., 

whether the pool is privately offered pursuant to section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, a multi-advisor pool

, or a limited risk pool

; a statement whether the pool is continuously offered or the closing date of the offering; the date of the disclosure
document; and the ``break-even point'' for the pool, that is, the trading profit that the pool must realize in its first
year for a participant to recoup its initial investment. The break-even point would provide a simple illustration
of the costs of investing in the pool and facilitate comparisons among pools.










The Commission considered whether a particular order for all required information should be mandated in order to
``standardize'' the entire format of disclosure documents but determined to propose only the limited sequence requirements
discussed above at this time. However, the Commission requests comment on the appropriateness and desirability
of mandating that all required information be presented in a specified order to foster clarity in and comparability
of disclosure documents, ease of regulatory review, and development of compliance guidance or instructions.

2. Voluntary Disclosures 


To address concerns that in many cases the disclosure process fails to achieve its intended purpose due to the high
volume of information included in the disclosure document, the Commission is proposing a format for disclosure documents
under which ``voluntary'' disclosures, 

i.e.

, those not required by Commission rules
 or those of other regulators, would be required to be placed in the disclosure document after all relevant required
disclosures. Proposed Rule 4.24(v) would require all information, other than that required by the Commission, the
antifraud provisions of the Act, and any federal or state securities laws and regulations, to appear following the
related required disclosures. Such ``voluntary information'' could not be misleading in content or presentation
or inconsistent with required disclosures. In addition, voluntary information would be subject to the antifraud
provisions of the Act and the regulations thereunder and to rules regarding the use of promotional material promulgated
by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. This format is designed to accommodate the
apparent desire of some CPOs and CTAs to include in disclosure documents information that is not required under the
Commission's rules or those of other regulators, while assuring that core disclosures are given due prominence.
Naturally, CPOs and CTAs would continue to be subject to the antifraud prohibitions of sections 4b and 4

o

 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6b and 6

o

,

49

 with respect to all disclosures, including disclosures voluntarily provided. 





3. Investee Pools 


The proposed disclosure framework specifically addresses disclosures concerning investee pools. As discussed
in the performance section, for purposes of past performance disclosures, investee pools would be treated comparably
to CTAs, 

i.e.

, the scope of performance disclosure required would be based on the amount of assets of the offered pool committed
to the investee pool. However, a different benchmark for applying the twenty-five percent (as used in the major investee
pool definition) and ten percent (for adverse performance disclosure to be required) thresholds is used for investee
pools in light of the fact that investments in other pools generally expose the pool only to loss of the initial investment
and that the full amount of the investment is required to be paid at the inception of the investment. The relative importance
of investee pools to prospective pool participants is thus more appropriately determined by reference to the proportion
of the pool's total assets invested in the investee pool. The proposal would streamline other investee pool disclosures
to obviate the need for CPOs to substantially incorporate in the document the contents of each investee pool's disclosure
document.

50

 Non-performance disclosure requirements relating to investee pools also would be tailored to take into account
the relative importance of the investee pool to the offered pool, as measured by the amount of assets of the pool offered
allocated to it. Thus, no disclosures would be required for investee pools allocated less than ten percent of the assets
of the pool offered and disclosures with respect to other investee pools would be limited based on the proportion of
the pool's assets allocated to them. Specifically, with respect to each investee pool allocated at least ten percent
of the assets of the pool offered, the CPO also would be required to disclose its name and that of its CPO and its principals
and any conflicts of interest on the part of the investee pool's CPO in respect of the offered pool. 




With respect to major investee pools, 

i.e.

, those allocated twenty-five percent or more of the assets of the offered pool, the CPO would be required to disclose
the business background of, material litigation against, and any ownership in the pool offered on the part of its CPO
and its principals. In addition, the use of proceeds, risk factors, fees and expense, and redemption sections of the
document would call for specific information relative to investments in investee pools. Risk disclosure relative
to investee pools would be required because investments in investee pools may create both the risks inherent in the
investee pool's own investments and liquidity risks due to restrictions upon redemption of the investment in the
investee pool. Fees and expenses may accrue at each level of a multi-tier structure and should be disclosed. Investments
in investee pools with redemption periods different from those of the pool offered or with minimum ``lock-in'' provisions
 may affect the ability of that pool to promptly honor redemption requests from its participants.

The Commission requests comment concerning the proposed treatment of investee pools. In particular, commenters
are invited to address any special public policy or disclosure considerations presented by tiered investment structures
by means of which a commodity pool can, in effect, appropriate the value of a second fund's management by investing
all or a portion of its funds in the second fund. The Commission also requests comment concerning whether any additional
protections, other than disclosure of applicable fees, are appropriate in light of the ``layering'' of fees that
typically occurs at each level of a fund of funds structure. 


4. Risk Disclosure Statement 


Rule 4.21 currently requires that disclosure documents include a prescribed bold-face statement alerting prospective
pool participants to the risks involved in participating in a pool. This statement does not specifically address
the risks of trading foreign futures or foreign option contracts. The risks attributable to foreign futures and foreign
options were originally required to be addressed by a special disclosure statement, set forth in part 30 of the Commission's
regulations, which generally governs transactions in foreign futures and foreign options.

52

 Thus, a CPO offering a pool expected to trade foreign and domestic futures or options was required to include in the
disclosure document the Rule 4.21 risk disclosure statement, which does not refer to foreign futures or options,
and the Rule 30.6 foreign futures and options risk disclosure statement. However, Rule 1.55, the basic risk disclosure
requirement applicable to FCMs and IBs opening accounts for domestic futures and option contracts, was recently
amended to consolidate the required disclosures concerning foreign futures and options into the domestic risk disclosure
statement, and the separate Rule 30.6(a) disclosure statement was eliminated.

53

 Consequently, under the revised Rules 1.55 and 30.6, CPOs and CTAs offering pools and accounts, respectively, which
may engage in foreign futures and option transactions would be required to include the new consolidated Rule 1.55
risk disclosure statement as well as the part 4 risk disclosure statement in the disclosure document.






The Commission is proposing to address the potential for duplicative disclosure created by the recent rule revisions
and to eliminate the necessity for providing two prescribed risk disclosure statements by revising the part 4 risk
disclosure statements for CPOs and CTAs to address the risks of foreign as well as domestic transactions. Rule 30.6(b)
would be revised to cross-reference the part 4 statement. In addition, the terms ``domestic'' and ``foreign'' previously
used to refer to contract markets or exchanges in foreign jurisdictions are proposed to be replaced with the terms
``United States'' and ``non-United States'' to avoid confusion in the context of offerings in non-United States
jurisdictions to non-United States participants for whom the term ``foreign'' does not mean ``non-United States''.

54

 Rule 1.55 would also be amended to provide that pools need not be treated as customers for the purposes of delivery of
the risk disclosure statement.

5. Business Background 



Rule 4.21(a)(2) currently requires disclosure of the business backgrounds of the pool's CPO and CTA, and their principals.
This disclosure requirement would be streamlined by: (1) Eliminating the requirement to disclose business backgrounds
of CTAs except those of major CTAs, 

i.e., 

CTAs allocated at least twenty-five percent of the fund's futures margins and commodity option premiums; and (2)
limiting the requirement to disclose business backgrounds of principals
 of CPOs and CTAs to those principals ``who participate in making trading or operational decisions for the pool or who
supervise those so engaged.''
 Comment is requested as to whether the business backgrounds of all principals, even those who hold a passive ownership
interest in the CPO, should continue to be required to be disclosed. The business backgrounds of trading managers,
who represent a subset of CTAs, and their principals who participate in making trading or operational decisions or
supervise persons so engaged would also be required to be disclosed. 






6. Principal Risk Factors 



As noted above, current Rule 4.21(a)(17)(ii) requires the inclusion, at the front of the disclosure document, of
a ``boiler-plate'' risk disclosure statement that describes generically the risks of pool investments. Proposed
Rule 4.24(g) would require, in addition to this required disclosure, a discussion designed to address risk factors
specific to the pool offered. This discussion would address the volatility of the pool investment as compared to investments
in other types of trading vehicles and other risks relating to the particular trading program to be followed, such
as risks resulting from concentration of investments in particular commodities or contracts or from trading foreign
contracts that are subject to currency rate fluctuations. Risks relative to transactions in off-exchange instruments,
e.g., counterparty creditworthiness risks,

57

 or to the lack of relevant experience of the CPO or CTAs should also be addressed. The Commission believes that a succinct
``plain English'' discussion of the risks of the investment being offered would be highly material to the prospective
participant's evaluation of the proposed investment and that this type of disclosure warrants particular attention
when complex over-the-counter transactions are contemplated. Establishment of an express requirement for disclosure
of principal risk factors essentially codifies disclosures that would likely be required under the specific requirements
of existing rules or as material information.

58

 






The Commission welcomes comment as to whether additional guidance should be given in the rule as to the types of risk
factors that should be discussed and as to any specific factors that should be identified in this context. 



7. Use of Proceeds 



Under current Rule 4.21(a)(1)(viii), the pool operator must describe the types of commodity interests that the pool
is expected to trade and any restrictions or limitations on such trading established by the CPO. Current Rule 4.21(a)(9)
requires a description of the manner in which the pool will fulfill its margin requirements and of the form in which
non-margin funds will be held. The nature of non-cash items must be described and the person to whom any income generated
by such items will be paid must be identified. Taken together, Rules 4.21(a)(1)(viii) and (a)(9) call for information
concerning all types of trading and investments in which the pool is expected to engage. As a result, under current
rules, CPOs generally provide a description of the overall trading activities of the pool, such that the full range
of transactions, whether in securities, commodity interests or other types of interests, is disclosed.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposal, current Rules 4.21(a)(1)(viii) and 4.21(a)(9) would be consolidated into Rule 4.24(h) under
the caption ``Use of Proceeds''
 and revised to better reflect changes in the nature of funds management. Proposed Rule 4.24(h) would require the description
of the pool's trading
 to include not only transactions in commodity interests but also any other types of interests in which the pool is expected
to trade. With respect to pool funds that are not deposited as margin or held in cash or cash equivalents, the proposed
rule would require disclosure of the nature of such property, for example, whether it consists of securities listed
on a national securities exchange, bonds, commercial paper or interests in commodity pools, whether such property
is subject to state or federal regulation or to regulation by a foreign government, and any investment rating applicable
to such property. The proposed rule also would require the CPO to indicate the type of custodian, 

e.g., 

bank, broker-dealer or other entity, which will hold property not deposited as margin or option premiums and the jurisdiction
where held, if other than the United States. The Commission believes that the proposed use of proceeds provision should
provide a more coherent statement of the matters called for by current requirements in a manner that is consistent
with current practice. 






8. Fees and Expenses 



Rule 4.21(a)(7) currently requires a description of the expenses that the CPO knows or should know have been incurred
in the past year or will be incurred in the current year. Expenses required to be disclosed include, without limitation,
fees for management, trading advice, brokerage commissions, legal advice, accounting and organizational services.
Rule 4.21(a)(14) requires disclosure of fees and commissions paid in connection with solicitations for the pool.
Proposed new Rule 4.24(i) would combine the requirements of Rule 4.21 (a)(7) and (a)(14) to provide in a single section
of the disclosure document a complete discussion of costs incurred by the pool for all purposes. 

The proposed provision relating to fees and expenses (Rule 4.24(i)) requires a detailed description of fees and expenses,
including certain fees and expenses that are not specifically enumerated in current Rule 4.21 but that constitute
material disclosures and are thus required to be disclosed.

61

 Thus, clearance fees and fees paid to national exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, incentive fees, including
any disproportionate share of profits allocated to the CPO, 

i.e., 

a right of the CPO to receive a greater than pro-rata share of the pool's profits, and fees and expenses incurred as a
result of investments in investee pools and other investment vehicles or to fund the guarantee of a limited risk pool,
would be required to be set forth specifically in the table. In addition, the proposed rule would clarify that disclosure
of fees paid in connection with solicitations for the pool must include trailing commissions as well as any type of
benefit that may accrue to persons engaged in such solicitations. 





Expenses, fees and commissions are assessed based on various factors. For example, brokerage fees are assessed based
on a round-turn commission, management fees may be based on the net asset value of the pool's assets, incentive fees
on trading profits, and sales commissions may be charged as a percentage of the proceeds of the offering. A description
of each separate fee and expense may not, however, convey a clear understanding of the actual portion of each pool participation
absorbed by fees and expenses. As the risk disclosure statement required by current Rule 4.21(a)(17) indicates,
``in some cases, commodity pools are subject to substantial charges for management, advisory and brokerage fees,''
and ``it may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid
depletion or exhaustion of their assets.'' 

To foster a better understanding of the nature of those costs and their impact upon the investment, the proposal would
require, in addition to a narrative description, a tabular presentation of fees and expenses from all sources setting
forth how the break-even point for the pool is calculated (``break-even analysis''). As noted 

supra, 

the ``break-even point'' for the pool, 

i.e., 

the trading profit that a pool or trading program must realize in its first year to equal all fees and expenses such that
a participant or client will recoup its initial investment,

62

 would be required to be set forth as a single figure in the forepart of the pool disclosure document, expressed as a percentage
of a unit of initial investment. The break-even analysis would provide an explanation, in tabular form, of how the
break-even point is calculated, taking into account all fees, expenses and commissions applicable to the pool. The
proposal would require the break-even analysis to be prepared in accordance with rules promulgated by a registered
futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act. As noted above, NFA has filed with the Commission a proposed
interpretation of Compliance Rule 2-13 which would set forth how a break-even point must be calculated and the
format in which such calculation must be disclosed.

63

 The Commission believes that these proposed requirements with respect to fees and expenses will serve to better codify
disclosures required under existing rules and assist readers of disclosure documents in understanding the nature
and effect upon investment returns of costs incidental to the offering and operation of the pool. The Commission requests
comment as to whether a description of fees and expenses should continue to be required or whether the break-even analysis
is sufficient to accurately describe the costs of participation in a pool.

9. Conflicts of Interest and Related Party Transactions 


Pursuant to current Rule 4.21(a)(3), a description of any actual or potential conflict of interest regarding the
pool on the part of the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals must be included in the disclosure document. This discussion
must include a description of any arrangement whereby the CPO, CTA or their principals may benefit from the maintenance
of the pool account with the FCM or from its introduction to an FCM by an IB. Like current Rule 4.21(a)(3), proposed Rule
4.24(j) would require disclosure of any conflict of interest on the part of the pool's CPO and its principals. Subject
to the requirement that all material information be disclosed, the proposal would eliminate such disclosure with
respect to CTAs allocated less than ten percent of the pool's futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee
pools allocated less than ten percent of the pool's assets.

64

 The proposed rule also would require disclosure of conflicts of interest with respect to any persons providing services
to the pool or soliciting participants for the pool. This provision would encompass certain categories of Commission
registrants specified in the existing rule, 

i.e.

, FCMs and IBs, as well as any other person providing services to the pool.

65

 The Commission believes that the purposes of conflict of interest disclosure are not limited to situations where
such conflicts relate to a Commission registrant and that there may be unregulated parties, 

e.g.

, a CPO affiliate acting as counterparty to over-the-counter transactions with the pool, as to whom such disclosure
may be equally material. Consequently, the Commission proposes to delete the specific reference in the current rule
to the pool's FCM and IB and their principals and to substitute more general terminology intended to include but not
to be limited to FCMs and IBs. Although the express requirement of disclosure of conflicts of interest on the part of
FCM and IB principals would be eliminated, disclosure of such conflicts may be required as material information in
specific situations, 

e.g.

, where an FCM's majority owner or other controlling person has such a conflict in regard to the pool.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the current provision requiring the description of carrying broker or introducing arrangements benefitting
the CPO or CTA and their principals has been revised to make clear that payments for order flow and soft dollar arrangements
must be included. Payment for order flow is a practice whereby FCMs and IBs compensate CPOs and CTAs for directing customers
to them. Soft dollar arrangements consist of arrangements whereby customer or pool funds are used to pay for research
or other services that benefit the CPO or CTA. Both practices have been of concern to regulators because, among other
things, they are often inadequately disclosed.

66

 





Separately, under proposed Rule 4.24(k) (``Related Party Transactions''), any material transactions or arrangements
for which there is no publicly disseminated price between the pool and any person affiliated with a person providing
services to the pool, would be required to be disclosed, including the costs of such transactions to the pool.

67

 The Commission believes that this type of disclosure may be viewed as already required in many cases under the general
requirement that material information be disclosed. However, given the increasing use of over-the-counter transactions
in which pools contract with the pool operator or an affiliate of the pool operator, an express requirement for such
disclosure appears warranted. 




10. Litigation 


Current Rule 4.21(a)(13) requires disclosure of any material administrative, civil or criminal action within the
five years preceding the date of the disclosure document against the CPO, CTA(s), FCM, IB and their principals. Like
the current rule, proposed Rule 4.24(1) would require the disclosure of administrative, civil or criminal actions
against certain persons involved in operating or trading the pool during the five years preceding the date of the disclosure
document. However, this requirement would be substantially simplified. Concluded actions that resulted in an adjudication
on the merits in favor of such persons would not be required to be disclosed. In addition, disclosure of the litigation
background of FCMs and IBs would be limited as follows. First, with respect to litigation brought by private parties,
the proposed rule would provide for the materiality of the action to be determined by reference to the potential financial
impact upon the FCM or IB. Specifically, an action would be considered material if it would be required to be disclosed
in the notes to the registrant's financial statements prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles
(``GAAP''). Generally, under GAAP, certain information regarding litigation must be disclosed if the potential
of a financial loss from the litigation is either probable (

i.e.

, likely to occur) or reasonably possible (more than remote but less than likely).

68

 Except for events occurring subsequent to the issuance of the latest certified financial statements, under this
paragraph, litigation required to be disclosed would already have been disclosed in the FCM's or IB's latest certified
financial statements. 




Second, the requirement to disclose actions brought by the Commission and other regulatory agencies against FCMs
and IBs would be streamlined. Actions brought by the Commission would be treated differently from those brought by
other regulatory agencies due to the presumptively greater significance of such actions to an investment decision.
All actions brought by the Commission would be considered material other than concluded actions which did not result
in fines exceeding $50,000 and did not involve allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct. Actions brought
by any other federal or state agency or by a self-regulatory organization, whether domestic or foreign, would be considered
material if they involved allegations of fraud or other willful misconduct.

69

<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the proposed rule would eliminate the requirement to disclose litigation against CTAs allocated less
than twenty-five percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and the principals
of FCMs and IBs. Of course, as noted above with respect to conflicts of interest on the part of FCM and IB principals,
the requirement to disclose all material information may require such disclosure in particular cases. Proposed
Rule 4.24(

l

) also requires disclosure of litigation against a pool's trading manager, if any, and its principals, a requirement
which is encompassed within the existing requirement for disclosure of litigation against CTAs. 


11. Limited Risk Pools 


So-called ``guaranteed pools,'' which generally are designed to assure participants the return of their initial
investment, have been extensively offered in recent years. Such pools generally commit a significant portion of
their assets to interest-bearing instruments, letters of credit or other investments to fund the ``guarantee''
and correspondingly reduce the level of their futures or other investments. Many ``guarantee'' structures require
that the participant maintain his investment in the fund for a specified period of years in order to realize on the guarantee.
Because such structures impose significant costs which limit the potential for futures and other investment-related
returns, are often subject to significant conditions, 

e.g.

, that redemption rights not be exercised for a specified period of years from the date of the initial investment, and
are subject to varying degrees of risk of nonfulfillment due to unforeseen trading losses or other reasons, the use
of ``guarantee'' terminology in pool disclosure documents raises certain regulatory concerns. These concerns
relate to such matters as the representations expressly or impliedly made as to the nature and security of the pool
investment and the impact of the guarantee structure upon the overall investment. In Advisory 86-1
, the Division of Trading and Markets set forth certain disclosures that should be made in this context to assure that
prospective investors are apprised of material information concerning guarantee structures. These include, for
example, statements that a specified percentage of each unit of participation in the pool has been set aside to purchase
the guarantee, that redemptions are not available for a specified period and that additional expenses and management
fees are charged in connection with the guarantee, as applicable. 




Proposed Rule 4.24(

o

) would codify minimum disclosures relevant to limited risk pools. Under the proposal, the term ``limited risk pool''
would be defined in Rule 4.10(i) to mean ``a pool * * * that is designed to limit the loss
of the initial investment of its participants.'' Rule 4.24(

o

) would generally codify Advisory 86-1 by requiring the CPO of a limited risk pool to describe the nature of the
limitation on risk intended to be provided, the manner in which the limitation is achieved, including the cost of providing
it, the conditions that must be satisfied for participants to receive the benefits of the risk limitation and the circumstances
in which the risk limitation becomes operative.

71

 CPOs are also reminded of the admonition in Advisory 86-1 that ``(a)ny statements that suggest that the risks
of futures trading are decreased by reason of this structure have a high potential to mislead or deceive and could result
in serious violations of the Commission's regulations and anti-fraud provisions.'' 




12. Other Proposed Changes 


Current Rule 4.21 requires certain negative statements to be made in a pool disclosure document where there is no pertinent
information to report. A CPO must state, if true, that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding
any aspect of the pool on the part of certain persons, that certain persons do not own any beneficial interest in the
pool, that no material litigation occurred within the past five years against the CPO, CTA, FCM, IB and their principals,
and that the CPO, CTA, and their principals will not trade for their own accounts. These negative statements would
no longer be required.

Proposed Rule 4.21 would permit CPOs to provide prospective participants who are accredited investors as defined
in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act

 with a notice of intended offering and term sheet prior to delivery of the disclosure document. This provision should
facilitate the offering of pools that qualify for relief from registration under the Securities Act as private offerings.





The Commission is requesting comment as to whether there are specific situations in which the streamlined disclosure
document proposed herein may not offer adequate protection to prospective and existing pool participants or managed
account clients. Further, the Commission requests comment as to whether additional changes to further streamline
the requirements of Rule 4.21 and 4.31 and improve the clarity of such disclosures could be made without reducing customer
protection and on whether any additional disclosures should be required. 
The Commission also requests comment on whether the requirement in current Rule 4.21(d) (proposed to be numbered
as Rule 4.21(b)) that a CPO must receive from a prospective pool participant an acknowledgment that the participant
has received a disclosure document for the pool continues to be necessary.

C. Section 4.26_Use, Amendment and Filing of Disclosure Documents 


Except as follows, the requirements for updating pool disclosure documents would remain substantially unchanged
and are proposed to be set forth in Rule 4.26. The Commission is proposing to extend from six to nine months the maximum
period between the date on a disclosure document and the date of its use. This would conform the updating requirements
of pool disclosure documents to those of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act for public securities offerings.

73

 As under current Rule 4.21(b), two copies of each amendment to the disclosure document must be filed within twenty-one
calendar days of the date upon which the pool operator first knows or has reason to know of the defect requiring the amendment.
There has been some uncertainty as to whether amendments are subject to the twenty-one day prefiling requirements
of current Rule 4.21(g)(1) (renumbered as Rule 4.26(d)(1)). The Commission is confirming that such amendments may
be used simultaneously with their filing with the Commission, 

i.e.

, not more than twenty-one days after the date on which the pool operator first knows or has reason to know that the disclosure
document is materially inaccurate or incomplete. 




IV. Related Matters 


A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. 601-611 (1988), requires that agencies, in proposing rules,
consider the impact of those rules on small businesses. The rule amendments discussed herein would affect registered
CPOs and CTAs. The Commission has previously established certain definitions of ``small entities'' to be used by
the Commission in evaluating the impact of its rules on such entities in accordance with the RFA.

74

 The Commission previously determined that registered CPOs are not small entities for the purpose of the RFA.

75

 With respect to CTAs, the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within the context of a particular rule proposal
whether all or some affected CTAs would be considered to be small entities and, if so, the economic impact on them of
any rule.

76

 






The amendments proposed herein would reduce rather than increase the requirements of Rule 4.21 for CPOs and the requirements
of Rule 4.31 for CTAs. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 3(a) of the RFA (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Acting Chairman, on behalf
of the Commission, certifies that these proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The Commission nonetheless invites comment from any registered CPO or CTA who believes
that these rules would have a significant impact on its operations. 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, (``PRA'') 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et. seq

., imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting
or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance with the PRA the Commission has submitted
these proposed rule amendments and the associated information collection requirements to the Office of Management
and Budget. The burden associated with this entire collection, including this proposed rule, is as follows:

 

Average Burden Hours per Response: 124.65. 
Number of Respondents: 3,924. 
Frequency of Response: On Occasion. 



The burden associated with these specific proposed rules, is as follows: 



Average Burden Hours per Response: 8.05. 
Number of Respondents: 1,162. 
Frequency of Response: On Occasion. 



Persons wishing to comment on the estimated paperwork burden associated with this proposed rule should contact Gary
Waxman, Office of Management and Budget, room 3228, NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-7340. Copies of the
information collection submission to OMB are available from Joe F. Mink, CFTC Clearance officer, 2033 K Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20581, (202) 254-9735.

General disclosures required. 



Except as otherwise provided herein, a disclosure document must include the following information. 

(a) 

Cautionary statement

. The following Cautionary Statement, must be prominently displayed on the cover page of the disclosure document:



 


THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS NOT PASSED UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM
NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED ON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT. 


 


(b) 

Risk disclosure statement

. (1) The following Risk Disclosure Statement must be prominently displayed immediately following any disclosures
required to appear on the cover page of the disclosure document as provided by the Commission or any applicable federal
or state securities laws and regulations: 



RISK DISCLOSURE STATEMENT 



THE RISK OF LOSS IN TRADING COMMODITIES CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL. YOU SHOULD THEREFORE CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH
TRADING IS SUITABLE FOR YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO TRADE OR TO AUTHORIZE SOMEONE
ELSE TO TRADE FOR YOU, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING: 

IF YOU PURCHASE A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE PREMIUM AND OF ALL TRANSACTION COSTS. 

IF YOU PURCHASE OR SELL A COMMODITY FUTURE OR SELL A COMMODITY OPTION YOU MAY SUSTAIN A TOTAL LOSS OF THE INITIAL MARGIN
FUNDS AND ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU DEPOSIT WITH YOUR BROKER TO ESTABLISH OR MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF THE MARKET
MOVES AGAINST YOUR POSITION, YOU MAY BE CALLED UPON BY YOUR BROKER TO DEPOSIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MARGIN
FUNDS, ON SHORT NOTICE, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED
TIME, YOUR POSITION MAY BE LIQUIDATED AT A LOSS, AND YOU WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY RESULTING DEFICIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, YOU MAY FIND IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO LIQUIDATE A POSITION. THIS CAN OCCUR,
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THE MARKET MAKES A ``LIMIT MOVE.'' 

THE PLACEMENT OF CONTINGENT ORDERS BY YOU OR YOUR TRADING ADVISOR, SUCH AS A ``STOP-LOSS'' OR ``STOP-LIMIT'' ORDER,
WILL NOT NECESSARILY LIMIT YOUR LOSSES TO THE INTENDED AMOUNTS, SINCE MARKET CONDITIONS MAY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO
EXECUTE SUCH ORDERS. 

A ``SPREAD'' POSITION MAY NOT BE LESS RISKY THAN A SIMPLE ``LONG'' OR 
``SHORT'' POSITION. 

THE HIGH DEGREE OF LEVERAGE THAT IS OFTEN OBTAINABLE IN COMMODITY TRADING CAN WORK AGAINST YOU AS WELL AS FOR YOU. THE
USE OF LEVERAGE CAN LEAD TO LARGE LOSSES AS WELL AS GAINS. 

IN SOME CASES, MANAGED COMMODITY ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CHARGES FOR MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY FEES. IT
MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THOSE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THESE CHARGES TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL TRADING PROFITS TO AVOID
DEPLETION OR EXHAUSTION OF THEIR ASSETS. THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT CONTAINS, AT PAGE (insert page number), A COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF EACH FEE TO BE CHARGED TO YOUR ACCOUNT BY THE COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR AND A STATEMENT OF THE PERCENTAGE
RETURN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN, THAT IS, TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT OF YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number).


THIS BRIEF STATEMENT CANNOT DISCLOSE ALL THE RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF THE COMMODITY MARKETS. YOU SHOULD
THEREFORE CAREFULLY STUDY THIS DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT AND COMMODITY TRADING BEFORE YOU TRADE, INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS OF THIS INVESTMENT, AT PAGE (insert page number). 





(2) If the commodity trading advisor may trade foreign 
futures or options contracts, the Risk Disclosure Statement must 
further state the following: 


 


YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR MAY ENGAGE IN TRADING FOREIGN FUTURES OR OPTIONS CONTRACTS.
TRANSACTIONS ON MARKETS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING MARKETS FORMALLY LINKED TO A UNITED STATES
MARKET MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATIONS WHICH OFFER DIFFERENT OR DIMINISHED PROTECTION. FURTHER, UNITED STATES REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPEL THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES OR MARKETS IN NON-UNITED
STATES JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOUR TRANSACTIONS MAY BE EFFECTED. BEFORE YOU TRADE YOU SHOULD INQUIRE ABOUT ANY RULES
RELEVANT TO YOUR PARTICULAR CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND ASK THE FIRM WITH WHICH YOU INTEND TO TRADE FOR DETAILS
ABOUT THE TYPES OF REDRESS AVAILABLE IN BOTH YOUR LOCAL AND OTHER RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS. 


 


(3) If the commodity trading advisor is not also a registered futures commission merchant, the trading advisor must
make the additional following statement in the Risk Disclosure Statement, prominently disclosed as the last paragraph
thereof: 


 


THIS COMMODITY TRADING ADVISOR IS PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM ACCEPTING FUNDS IN THE TRADING ADVISOR'S NAME FROM A CLIENT
FOR TRADING COMMODITY INTERESTS. YOU MUST PLACE ALL FUNDS FOR TRADING IN THIS TRADING PROGRAM DIRECTLY WITH A FUTURES
COMMISSION MERCHANT.

Filing of Export Certificates 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to amend the Customs Regulations to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat-food
products to be cleared before the filing of a copy of an export certificate by providing a statement regarding the shipment
and the export certificate. The copy of the export certificate must then be presented within 4 days of the vessel's
clearance. The regulations are being amended so that they will conform to revised regulations of the Food Safety and
Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 


In this document, Customs proposes to amend its regulations so that there will be consistency between regulations
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and those of Customs regarding the timeframe within which an exporter
must file a certificate certifying the wholesomeness of meat products being exported. 
Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), meat and meat products intended and offered for export and sale in a foreign country must be inspected. In addition,
FMIA prohibits the clearance for departure of any vessel carrying meat and meat products for export to and sale in a
foreign country until the owner or shipper has obtained from an inspector a certificate indicating that the products
are sound and wholesome (unless the Secretary has waived certificate requirements for the country). 
In 1986, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the Department of Agriculture, which administers the FMIA,
amended its regulations. Previously, the FSIS regulations required that exporters deliver a duplicate of the export
certificate to the shipper for filing with Customs at the time the master's manifest or supplemental manifest is filed
by the chief officer with Customs; that is, on the day of departure. 
Otherwise, the vessel carrying the meat or meat products would not be granted clearance. Because  4.75 of the
Customs regulations allows shippers a delay of four business days in the filing of a Complete Cargo Declaration (manifest),
the FSIS regulations were amended to allow a vessel carrying a shipment of meat or meat products to clear in those instances
where the duplicate export certificate is not available at departure time. In lieu of the duplicate export certificate,
the shipper, shipper's agent or the vessel's agent must provide Customs with a statement under the shipper's or agent's
letterhead signed by the shipper which briefly describes the shipment of the product, the number of boxes, the number
of pounds, the product name and the USDA export certificate number that covers the shipment. Exporters must file the
duplicate export certificate within 4 days of the clearance of a vessel carrying a shipment of meat products. 
In order to maintain consistency with Customs and USDA regulations, Customs is now proposing to amend that section
of its regulations governing the clearance of vessels carrying meat products. Section 4.72(a) of the Customs Regulations
(19 CFR 4.72(a)) currently states that no clearance shall be granted to a vessel carrying meat or meat-food product
until copies of the export certificates issued by the USDA have been filed with the district director. Customs is proposing
to amend this section so that clearance can be granted to vessels when documents complying 
with the requirements of 9 CFR part 322 of the USDA regulations 
are submitted. Shippers will still have to comply with the four-day time limit of  4.75 for submitting the actual
USDA export certificate. 


Comments 


Before adopting the proposed amendment, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted to
Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552),  1.4, Treasury Regulations (31 CFR 1.4), and  103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19
CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at the Regulations Branch, 1099 14th
Street, NW., Suite 4000, Washington, DC. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This amendment is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of E.O. 12866. Based on the supplementary
information set forth above and pursuant to the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601,

ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to revise various safety-related regulations regarding the design and operating procedures
of production platforms and pipelines in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The purpose of the revisions is to reduce
or prevent the unintentional release of hydrocarbons from pipelines on or near offshore platforms during emergency
situations and thereby reduce the potential for explosions or fires.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background 


The MMS is proposing to revise regulations governing design, operation, and maintenance of oil and gas facilities
in the OCS. These revisions were recommended by an internal task group that reviewed information on tow tragic offshore
incidents in 1988 and 1989. 



Safety Review Task Group 


A safety review task group of MMS personnel was established to review available information in the 1988 Piper Alpha
platform fire in the North Sea and the circumstances related to an interactive pipeline and platform fire in 1989 at
ARCO Oil and Gas Company's (ARCO) South Pass 60 Platform ``B'' facility in the Gulf of Mexico. The group was asked to
make specific recommendations regarding regulations and operating practices that would reduce the risk of such
incidents occurring in U.S. waters. Following is a capsule summary of each incident. 



Explosion and Fire on Piper Alpha Platform, North Sea, 1988 



Piper Alpha was an oil and gas production platform in the United Kingdom (U.K.) sector of the North Sea that was destroyed
by fire in 1988. On July 6, 1988, a series of events and operational mistakes caused an explosion and fires that ultimately
destroyed the platform and killed 167 people. Maintenance personnel mistakenly activated an out-of-service injection
pump causing a repair flange in the pipework to rupture. Liquid condensate leaked into the production module for several
minutes. The gas ignited and exploded, damaging the electrical power generator and the fire pumps. Eventually the
fire ruptured the shut-in gas pipelines releasing high pressure gas on the platform. The fire burned for several hours
until the pressure was relieved. The platform was completely destroyed.

The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster was published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, in November
1990. The report confirmed the conclusions reached in the initial investigation report published in September 1988.
The report concluded that in all likelihood the scenario of the leaking blind flange in the condensate injector pump
was the initial cause of the incident. The report lists 106 recommendations for improving safety in the U.K. North
Sea. The recommendations propose changes to the regulations, regulatory agency realignment, and a call for renewed
commitment to safety by industry.



Summary of South Pass 60 Platform ``B'' Fire



On March 19, 1989, an offshore contracting crew was ``cold-cutting'' an 18-inch gas line riser at the platform's 10-foot
level in preparation for the installation of a pig trap. ``Cold cutting'' is a method of cutting through a section of
pipe with a mechanical cutting tool as opposed to using a blow torch. Upon penetration into the pipeline riser, pressurized
condensate began to spray from the cut area. The condensate was ignited either by sparks generated on the compressor
skid on an attendant workboat or by hot exhaust pipes on the above production deck. The fire raged upward from the riser,
and the emergency shutdown (ESD) system shut down both Platform ``B'' and Platform ``E'' and all incoming and departing
pipelines. Six of the 10 incoming and departing pipelines, including a high pressure gas line, ruptured from the heat
of the fire. The resulting explosions killed seven people and destroyed the platform.



Federal Register Notice on Subsea Pipeline Valves



In support of the work of the task group, MMS published a 

Federal Register

 Notice dated July 23, 1990 (55 FR 29860), seeking information on subsea shutdown valve (SDV) technology and feasibility
and offshore emergency pipeline pressure reduction techniques. Thirty companies and organizations representing
oil- and gas-related industries responded to the questionnaire. Their responses are discussed later in the preamble.



Task Group Findings



The MMS task group identified the following areas in the regulations that should be revised:




1. Identification and notification procedures for out-of-service safety devices and systems.

2. Location and protection of pipeline risers.

3. Diesel and helicopter fuel storage areas and tanks.

4. Approval of pipeline repairs.

5. Location of ESD valves on pipelines.



Identification and Notification Procedures for Out-of-Service Safety Devices



A contributing factor to both accidents was the lack of communication and notification to personnel of the platform
production systems status. In the Piper Alpha incident, the production crew attempted to start a condensate injection
pump that was partially dismantled for repairs during the previous shift. Leaking condensate from the associated
pipework of the pump caused the first of a series of explosions and fires. The location of the pump control panel did
not allow the operator of the control panel to view the pump or detect the leak. In the South Pass 60 incident, the platform
operator and the pipeline company did not provide for adequate planning and coordination of the riser cutting operation.
Platform personnel were apparently unaware of the status of the riser cutting operation or the difficulty the contractor
was experiencing with the unexpected flow.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Current regulations for identifying out-of-service devices are found at:

30 CFR 250.123(c), General platform operations. (1) Surface or subsurface safety devices shall not be bypassd or
blocked out of service unless they are temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing procedures.
Only the minimum number of safety devices shall be taken out of service. Personnel shall monitor the bypassed or blocked-out
functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device which is temporarily
out of service shall be flagged.

Requirements for out-of-service devices on pipelines are found at 30 CFR 250.154(c). If the required safety equipment
is rendered ineffective or removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an equivalent degree
of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating
that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

The task group determined that the existing regulations do not provide for adequate communication or warning of out-of-service
equipment and may not have prevented an accident similar to Piper Alpha if the same set of circumstances existed in
the OCS. The current rule does not ensure that accidental flow of hydrocarbons will not be initiated in process components
that are taken out of service, particularly if flow is initiated out of view of a flagged device or control. Flagging
requirements for out-of-service equipment and valves need to be revised to ensure that control panels and certain
equipment upstream of process equipment or valves are also flagged and that the procedure is documented. The task
group recommended that the regulations should include requirements identifying which individuals have the authority
to remove flags and to authorize equipment startup. It also recommended that subpart A be revised to include a briefing
requirement to ensure that all workers on a production platform are notified of all out-of-service equipment and
safety concerns at the beginning of each work shift or upon addition or replacement of personnel.



Location and Protection of Pipeline Risers



From the evidence gathered on Piper Alpha, at least one of the highly pressured risers ruptured when struck by debris
falling from the burning platform. The effect of gas escaping from the high pressure pipeline was catastrophic. The
escaping gas boiled to the surface, exploded, and burned under the platform for several hours.

Subpart J of the regulations currently requires risers to be protected only from contact with floating vessels. Protection
is usually accomplished by locating risers between the jacket legs or by reinforcing the risers with external protection.
The task group recommended that subpart J be revised to add a requirement to provide for riser protection from falling
objects as well and that MMS require submission of piping drawings at an early stage in the platform design approval
process.



Diesel and Helicopter Fuel Storage Areas and Tanks



During the early stages of the Piper Alpha incident, fuel drums and containers of lubricants and cleaners stored throughout
the platform exploded and burned when they were exposed to flames. These materials are stored in a similar manner on
U.S. facilities.

There are no current MMS regulations for fuel storage. The task group recommended that MMS revise the regulations
to require operators to store diesel and other flammable liquids on platforms in accordance with the requirements
contained in American Petroleum Institute (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 500, Recommended Practice for Classification
of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities. The task group also recommended that the revised
regulations require operators to design fuel storage tanks in accordance with API RP 14C, Recommended Practice for
Analysis, Design, Installation and Testing of Basic Surface Safety Systems for Offshore Production Platforms.



Approval of Pipeline Repairs



Upon examination of the events leading to the fire on the ARCO ``B'' platform, the task group found that there was a lack
of communication and coordination between the platform operator and the pipeline repair company. The task group
recommended that the regulations be strengthened by requiring MMS approval for pipeline repairs. The Regional Supervisor,
upon being notified that the lessee or right-of-way holder is anticipating a pipeline repair, will consider the complexity
of the repair procedure in deciding whether or not to require a written repair plan. Exceptions would be made for pipeline
repairs necessitated by imminent harm to the environment or to human safety.

Location of ESD Valves on Pipelines



The Piper Alpha fire and the Arco ``B'' fire were greatly intensified by released gas from pipelines associated with
the platforms. In the United States, incoming pipelines are required to have emergency SDV's as a protective measure,
but they are often located onboard the platform to allow access for maintenance and testing.

Locating SDV's away from the process equipment, such as on the seafloor or on the riser close to the waterline, may provide
a greater level of protection for the platform but would at the same time reduce accessibility for repair and maintenance.
This issue has major safety and reliability implications; therefore, MMS published the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 requesting more information on this subject.

Thirty responses to the questionnaire were received from the oil and gas industry, including major oil and gas production
companies, pipeline operators, and equipment manufacturers. The first 13 questions dealt with locating a pipeline
SDV on the seafloor or just above the splash zone. Approximately half of the respondents cited limited access to a valve,
particularly those located on the seafloor, for inspection and maintenance purposes as a major area of concern. Nearly
half of the commenters suggested that the reliability of subsea valves is unknown or nonexistent. Again, supporting
data was very limited. The remaining four questions dealt with pipeline pressure reduction during emergency situations.
The results of the questionnaire are discussed after this section.

For applications in the United States, the task group considered three distinct riser locations for the placement
of SDV's: On the platform, on the seafloor, on the vertical portion of the riser below the lowest production deck but
above the waterline. The advantages and disadvantages of each location are discussed below:

The first location considered was ``on the platform.'' Subpart J_Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way,  250.154(b)(2)
requires that,




Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately
upon boarding the platform * * *




This regulation allows placement of the SDV on the deck where the riser enters the platform. ``Immediately upon boarding''
means near the edge of the platform. Accessibility for testing and maintenance is the greatest advantage to this location
since the valve is located within the platform structure. Also, since the valve is located in close proximity of the
production processing equipment, there is little or no hydrocarbon inventory between the valve and the process equipment
that needs to be vented in the event of an emergency. However, this location also presents the greatest potential safety
hazard. Since the valve is located near the process equipment, it is vulnerable to damage from explosions, extreme
heat from fires, and falling debris during emergency situations. The task group determined that the valve in this
location does not fulfill the intended purpose of an SDV in all situations since failure of the SDV or pressured portion
of the riser would likely result in the release of a significant portion of the pipeline inventory at the point of failure.
This vulnerability was demonstrated in the Piper Alpha disaster and the South Pass 60 fire.

Next, the task group considered locating SDV's on the seafloor a short distance from the platform. The safety advantage
of this location is obvious. The valve is isolated from the platform and is not vulnerable to explosions or fire that
may occur during an emergency situation. However, a major drawback of this location is inaccessibility for maintenance
and testing, especially in deep water. At this location, the valve would isolate the majority of the pipeline inventory
from the platform. However, there may be a significant hydrocarbon inventory in the riser between the valve on the
seafloor and the process equipment. This inventory must be safely vented when the pipeline is depressurized during
an emergency after the valve is closed.

Lastly, the task group considered locating SDV's on the vertical portion of risers below the lowest production deck
of the platform but above the waterline. This location offers several advantages. The valve is removed from and placed
below the hydrocarbon process areas within the platform, thereby isolating it from potential explosion and fire
damage during emergency situations. Also, it effectively isolates the entire inventory of the pipeline from the
platform since there is a minimal length of riser between the valve and the process equipment that must be vented during
emergency situations, and the valve is above the waterline and is accessible for maintenance and testing.

Considering the information gathered from the 

Federal Register

 Notice and additional information regarding subsea valve installations in the U.K. North Sea, the task group concluded
that locating such valves on risers or on the seafloor was technically feasible. Other aspects of the current regulation
were also reviewed. The task group considered the current regulation which requires SDV's to be installed on incoming
pipelines only. Based on the events that occurred on Piper Alpha, the task group determined that there is a significant
potential hazard from blackflow of pressured hydrocarbons from departing pipelines. Therefore, the task group
recommended requiring SDV's on all new pipelines entering and departing production platforms. This requirement
should also apply to sulphur operations since sulphur is also flammable and poses a significant threat to safety.
This requirement would cover bidirectional pipelines, crossing pipelines, fuel lines, and pipelines carrying
flammable or hazardous fluids. Crossing pipelines that enter onto platforms but do not take on production from those
platforms pose an environmental risk, if not a risk to human safety. Therefore, crossing pipelines should also be
required to have SDV's installed on the incoming and departing risers.

Responses to the Questions in the July 23, 1990, Federal Register Notice




The following represents a summary of the responses received and does not necessarily reflect the opinion of MMS.




Question

_If the SDV was located on the seafloor or just above the splash zone, how would the following parameters be affected?


(a) 

Maintenance.


Response

_Subsea maintenance poses a major problem, especially for deep water which would be difficult during rough seas and
winter months. This jeopardizes the operation of the pipeline during those periods. Preventative subsea maintenance
would be impractical while maintenance by divers would pose an additional safety risk. Minor and major repairs of
a valve would most likely require removal from the pipe which is dangerous in itself and would require shutting down
the pipeline system for extended periods.


The splash zone is the most corrosive offshore environment. The cyclical wetting and drying of surface materials
accelerate the corrosion process and degrades protective coatings. At the splash zone, increased maintenance would
be required and most platforms have limited access in this area. Splash zone maintenance could not be performed during
rough seas or winter months, thus jeopardizing the operation of the pipeline during those periods. Control lines
would also be exposed to the corrosive wet/dry environment. Requiring SDV's to be located subsea or at the splash zone
increases the safety risk to personnel and reduces the pipeline system's reliability.


The diving cost alone to repair a subsea SDV in 180 feet of water would run between $15,000 and $18,000 per day.


(b) 

Inspection.






Response

_Subsea SDV inspection by a diver would be of minimal value. Control systems for subsea valves are more complex than
for surface valves. The ability of divers to inspect and perform repairs underwater is questionable and cannot be
verified. Inspection and repair operations would be limited by weather conditions.


Inspection of an SDV above the splash zone is reliable since it can be performed by an engineer or company representative.
All inspection information is first hand.


A typical subsea SDV inspection in 300 feet of water could cost between $20,000 and $30,000 per day.


(c) 

Testing.


Response

_Testing subsea valves from a remote station is not reliable and may indicate problems that may or may not exist.


Dealing with a malfunction during testing could have serious implications due to limited accessibility.


The higher the SDV is located above the water, the greater its accessibility, maintenance, and performance.


Frequency of subsea SDV testing should be kept to a minimum in order to maintain valve reliability.


Testing would be complex. Remote monitoring or divers would be necessary to confirm test results.


(d) 

Reliability.






Response

_Reliability is dependent on the individual reliability of all the components that make up the SDV and control system.
Subsea valve reliability statistics are not presently available and need to be established. 


It is assumed that the reliability of an SDV functioning on the seafloor would be less than at any other location. Access
to the SDV and control lines would be limited and equipment and personnel would be exposed to adverse conditions.


The reliability of an SDV functioning in the splash zone would be slightly higher. Accessibility would be improved
but the valve itself and control lines would be exposed to more adverse conditions.


(e) 

Pressure venting.






Response

_Subsurface SDV's would be limited by the static back pressure of the seawater, or vent lines to the surface would be
required. This may cause a delay in response time.

A splash zone SDV would not have back pressure, but gas exhaust would need to be routed to the platform vent system.


Underwater venting of pipelines is not recommended due to environmental considerations.


The volume of hydrocarbons vented through the platform flare system would be greater for a subsea SDV than a platform
SDV. This is a serious safety consideration.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The capability to vent pressure from a pipeline should never take the form of bypassing the SDV but should be from the
respective ends of the pipelines.
(f) 

Bidirectional operations.
Response

_Not affected.
(g) 

Pigging operations.
Response_

Subsea valves should be fitted with remote position indicators to ensure the valve is fully open during pigging operations.


Question

_What measures could be taken to enhance performance and reliability_in particular, how could problems identified
in response to question one be alleviated?


Response_

Locating the SDV above the maximum wave height would alleviate most problems described in question one. Control lines
are relatively short and the valve is readily accessible for maintenance and repairs.
There are designs where safety can be achieved by other methods. There are also ``economical'' platforms where the
producer accepts more risk to reduce facility costs. The location of the SDV should be commensurate with the level
of protection afforded to other high-risk facilities on the platform.
The SDV's should be manufactured from materials which will avoid valve replacement and offer reliable performance.
The valve should have manual actuators and quick connect ends to facilitate operation or removal.
Platform operating decks should be made of plate, not grating. Plate acts as a fire wall. If the deck is made of plate,
the SDV can be safely located on the deck.
The SDV's should be self-operating and fail-safe closed.
Valves should be routinely inspected and tested as well as continuously monitored.
The SDV and control system should be protected from mechanical damage.
Placement of SDV's on the platform would improve reliability but would also minimize their effectiveness.
Redundant control and instrumentation systems may be desirable. Standards should be established for value specifications
and certification. Quality control in manufacturing could also enhance their reliability.
Valve technology has advanced to the point that reliable subsea operation is available. Advancement in the areas
of a valve failure data base and check valve technology could yield further reliability and performance.
Require a surface SDV as well as a subsea valve.


Question

_What types of SDV's are available that could be located on the seafloor?


Response_

Any valve designed for subsea service such as a quarter turn ball valve, check valve, or a gate valve could perform as
an SDV.
The use of hydraulically operated valves could present a pollution problem.
It is the actuator that needs to be scrutinized.
No existing SDV would likely serve the purpose when located on the seafloor.
Hydraulic or pneumatic systems would be most practical. Some manufacturers have devised an SDV for subsea service.

Question_

What specific limitations would be encountered with regard to placing the SDV at the seafloor location with respect
to the following variables?

(a) 

Size of valve.

Response_

For the most part, the size of the valve is not a major factor. However, valves over 12 inches in diameter are cumbersome,
heavy and difficult to maneuver, and maintain. Valves greater than 36 inches in diameter are difficult to obtain.

The valve and actuator may be quite large and may require mechanical protection.

(b) 

Pressure.

Response_

For the most part, pressure is not a major consideration except in deep water. Very large actuators may be needed to
overcome extreme differential pressures in deep water.

(c) 

Flow rate.

Response_

For low flow rates, the reduced flow may not justify the placement of a seafloor SDV.

(d) 

Water depth.

Response_

Water depth has a large effect on diver costs for installation, maintenance, repairs, testing, etc. Deep-water locations
also require novel installation methods, additional complexity, and further development of components and testing
methods to achieve valve reliability. Some SDV's may be designed for installation and maintenance using a drilling
rig. Beyond, 1,000 feet, diverless maintenance and retrieval become major considerations. Common valve operators
are limited to water depths of less than 3,000 feet.

In shallow water, subsea valves would be subjected to potential damage from shipping vessels.

(e) 

Types of fluids transported.

Response_

Gas lines that are pressurized contribute a higher risk to platform safety than nonpressurized oil lines.

(f) 

Other variables identified by commenters.

Response_

Repairing and replacing subsea SDV's would increase pollution potential.

Reliable valve operation is the biggest concern. Factors affecting operation include water pressure and severe
water forces on the valve and operating lines, hydrate formation, wax build up, etc. Chemical injection may be necessary
to prevent hydrate or wax build up.

<TEXT>
 

The use of seafloor SDV's would preclude the use of J-tube methods of riser installation since the valve could not be
passed through the J-tube.

Sea-bottom conditions may dictate the location of SDV's.

Protective coverage would be necessary to prevent trawl damage.

Heavy valves, should they become suspended, will cause additional stress on the pipeline.

The SDV's located near the waterline would be vulnerable to collisions and wave damage.



Question

_What actuation and control system options are available for placement of the SDV on the seafloor (e.g., pneumatic,
hydraulic, electrical)? Would actuation backup capability be necessary or desirable?



Response

_Actuators can be powered by line pressure, stored gas pressure, or hydraulics. Fail-safe operation would be desirable.
Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are the most reliable for subsea service. Manual operation is also necessary. Electrical
systems could be used, but a backup system would be desirable. It is also necessary to provide manual diver valve actuation
for emergency situations.



Question

_What emergency support systems (e.g., fire loop system, ESD system, subsurface safety system) would activate the
subsea SDV? Should the conditions of actuation be different than for an SDV located on the platform?



Response

_All ESD and fire loop systems could operate the SDV. There would need to be a control line between the valve actuator
and the platform. This could pose a maintenance problem. Pressure sensors could also be installed for the case of a
ruptured or blocked line. This would require a relief valve, which brings up the following question. Where would the
relief valve relieve to, the seafloor? The foregoing provides yet another reason to have the SDV above water.



Question

_For seafloor placement of the SDV, what would be the optimum location in distance from the platform?



Response

_Distance is not very important. The closer to the platform, the better. This would keep the control lines the shortest.
Placing the valve 40 feet below the water surface on the riser would make it accessible to divers while providing its
structural protection.

The location of an SDV relative to the platform should ideally be decided by a quantified risk analysis. The optimum
distance for placement of an SDV should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering water depth, anchorage
areas, fishing areas, and minimizing the inventory between the platform and the SDV.



Question

_What effect would burial (either intentional or unintentional) of the valve and actuator have on maintenance and
operational reliability?



Response

_Burial would not hurt the SDV, but it would make it harder for divers to find it. Burial would increase the diving costs
associated with maintenance. Burial would preclude using a remotely operated vehicle for inspection and maintenance
and should be avoided.



Question

_What measures would be necessary to protect a subsea valve and control system from the following effects?

(a) 

Temperature.

Response

_The SDV and control system need to be designed to operate in internal and external environments by selection of suitable
materials.

(b) 

Hydrates.

Response

_Hydrate formation could prevent subsea SDV operation. Glycol injection lines would be required in addition to control
lines supplemented with glycol tanks, pumps, and attendant equipment.

(c) Permafrost.



Response

_Not feasible.

(d) Hydrogen sulfide.



Response

_The effects of hydrogen sulfide could be controlled with special alloys or inhibitors.

(e) Carbon dioxide.



Response

_The effects of carbon dioxide could be controlled with special alloys or inhibitors.

(f) Stress cracking.



Response.

_The effects of stress cracking could be controlled with special alloys. 

(g) Other effects identified by commenters.



Response.

_Control lines and connections could be damaged by boat or fishing activity. Protection will be necessary to protect
small lines from being hooked by trawl boats and anchors.

Sand production could jeopardize the operation of a subsea valve.

Corrosion protection will be necessary for valve operators and control lines.



Question

_Should SDV's be manufactured, maintained, and repaired in accordance with a certification process similar to the
process used with surface and subsurface safety valves?



Response

_API Spec 6D, Specification for Pipeline Valves, is a sufficient standard for valves, so certification is not necessary.
Pipeline SDV's are not critical to permanent containment of hydrocarbons. However, proper maintenance of subsea
valves may be a bigger issue.



Question

_Would the use of flexible piping impose difficulties to subsea valve?



Response

_Not so long as the pipeline is properly anchored at the valve location. High seas could pose a difficult problem (keeping
the pipe still). Also, special support may be necessary for the SDV.



Question

_If an SDV is placed at an alternate seafloor location, should an ADV also be placed on the platform?



Response

_An SDV installed on a platform has a different function than a subsea SDV. The platform SDV mitigates consequences
of a hydrocarbon release from the process equipment by isolating the pipeline from those facilities. Subsea SDV's
mitigate the consequences of a hydrocarbon release from the pipeline which may occur as a primary or secondary event.

In general, redundancy is always safer. However, redundancy costs more for equipment and increases the chance for
malfunction and platform downtime. Placement of a surface SDV should not be required but considered an option. In
general, SDV's should not be placed on the seafloor except in unusual circumstances.

If an SDV is installed above the splash zone, there is no need for another one on the seafloor.



Question

_Current regulations require SDV's on certain incoming pipelines. What, if any, SDV's should be required on outgoing
and crossing pipelines?



Response

_There is no need to place SDV's on all outgoing or crossing pipelines. Adding more valves is not necessary; however,
present valves may need to be relocated to safer locations.

The SDV's should be placed on new outgoing and crossing pipelines. A risk assessment should be performed on existing
lines before making such modifications.

Flow safety valves are adequate and less likely to fail, due to their simplistic design.

Unmanned platforms that contain no production facilities, no compression, and no power source should not require
SDV's.



Question

_What options are available to allow rapid reduction of pipeline pressure in an emergency, and what are the benefits
and drawbacks of the techniques?



Response

_Rapid reduction of pipeline pressure is a formidable problem. Flaring at the platform can be a very slow method of
reducing pipeline pressure. Strategically located SDV's along the pipeline may offer an alternative to depressurization.
An outlying subsea vent is probably safest since it distances the gas from the platform. However, in most cases, rapid
pressure reduction is expensive and of limited use.

There is the damage of the formation of hydrate plugs and liquid plug flow as well as the need to prevent expanding vapor
explosions.

Blowdown on the seafloor or a platform could cause considerable pollution due to entrained liquids and could feed
a fire in some instances.

Blowing down a pipeline at a platform would require a scrubber system to separate liquids. These liquids would need
to be disposed of safely which may be difficult during a platform emergency.



Question_

What are the benefits and shortcomings of subsea pipeline diversion?



Response_

System dependability might be enhanced by subsea diversion but not enough to offset additional cost over platform
diversion.

Subsea diversion could place evacuating and rescuing personnel in peril and could pose a significant pollution problem.




Question_

What are the advantages and disadvantages of having the capability to blow down a pipeline from both ends?



Response_

It may be good engineering practice to locate blowdowns at each end of a pipeline. One end may be inaccessible due to
fire or failure. If both ends are accessible, a more rapid blowdown can be accomplished. However, the majority of damage
and injuries on a platform occurs during the first few minutes and before pressure could be reduced. Actual damage
is not likely to be significantly reduced.

It would be necessary to bypass the check valve of the outgoing line. The bypass would need to be maintained and tested.
Facilities for large scrubbing, liquid handling, and flaring would also be required.



Question_

Should pipelines be required to have the capability of rapid reduction of pipeline pressure from either end and, if
so, what length of time should be specified as the maximum time for pipeline pressure reduction in an emergency situation?



Response_

Rapid pressure reduction is impractical during emergencies. Larger lines and volumes must be depressurized more
slowly.

The pest solution is accident prevention and efficient platform evacuation. Gas pipeline pressure cannot be reduced
fast enough to prevent early damage during a platform emergency.

In an emergency, evacuation is the primary concern. Flaring large volumes of gas could create a dangerous situation
for aircraft and boats.



Summary of Proposed Changes

1. Revise  250.1, Documents incorporated by reference, to incorporate API's Recommended Practice for Classification
of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities, First Edition, June 1, 1991 (API RP 500), into
the regulations. This document replaces API RP 500B, Recommended Practice for Classification of Areas for Electrical
Installations at Drilling Rigs and Production Facilities on Land and on Marine Fixed and Mobile Platforms, Second
Edition, with Supplement. API RP 500 combined API RP 500A, 500B, and 500C into a single document to provide guidelines
for classifying locations at petroleum facilities for the selection and installation of electrical equipment.
API RP 500 contains essentially the same information contained in API RP 500B. API RP 500 is referenced in  250.51(i)
to classify fuel and other flammable liquid storage locations. Also, references to API RP 500 replace API RP 500B in
  250.53(b), 250.122(e)(4)(i), 250.123(b)(9)(i), 250.291(b)(3) and (d)(4)(i), and 250.292(b)(4)(i).
2. Add a new  250.27, Safety of operations communication, that requires operators of offshore production platforms
to notify incoming or new personnel arriving on the platform of the status of repairs of process equipment, safety
systems, or other systems that are out of service. The new regulation also requires operators to maintain records
of all communications.
3. Revise  250.51, General requirements, to include requirements for fuel storage on offshore facilities.
4. Revise  250.123, Additional production system requirements, to be more specific on identifying and deactivating
process equipment and controls when safety systems are out of service and maintaining records.
5. Add a new paragraph,  250.153(a)(5), that requires operators to protect horizontal sections of pipeline
risers from damage by falling objects.
6. Revise  250.154 to require pipeline shutdown valves to be located below the lowest production deck on all
new pipelines entering and departing OCS platforms. This rule also applies to all pipelines under the jurisdiction
of MMS, including production flow lines, gathering lines, sulphur pipelines, fuel lines, bidirectional lines,
and crossing pipelines. For existing platforms and pipelines, the rule requires installation or relocation of valves
when significant riser repairs or maintenance is performed.
7. Revise  250.158 to give the Regional Supervisor authority to require operators to submit written pipeline
repair procedures for approval. The preparation and approval of written plans ensure that an operator adequately
considers the repair activity.


Author


The principal authors of this proposed rule are Elmer P. Danenberger, Chief, Engineering and Technology Division,
and Paul Schneider, Technology Assessment and Research Branch.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The DOI has also determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number
of small entities because, in general, the entities that engage in activities offshore are not considered small due
to the technical complexities and level of financial resources necessary to safely conduct such activities.


Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed rule adds new information collection requirements to subparts A and J. The information collection
requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval
as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The collection of this information will not be
required until it has been approved by OMB. Public reporting burdens for the new information collection requirements
contained in subparts A and J are estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspects of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer; Minerals Management
Service; Mail Stop 2053, 381 Elden Street; Herndon, Virginia 22070-4817, and the Office of Management and Budget;
Paperwork Reduction Project (1010-0030) for subpart A and (1010-0050) for subpart J; Washington, DC
20503, telephone (202) 395-7340.


Takings Implication Assessment


The DOI certifies that the proposed rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally
protected property rights. Thus, a Takings Implication Assessment need not be prepared pursuant to E.O. 12630, Government
Action and Interference with Constitutionally Protection Property Rights.

E.O. 12778



The DOI has certified to OMB that this proposed regulation meets the applicable civil justice reform standards provided
in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778.



National Environmental Policy Act



The DOI has determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment; therefore, preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.



E.O. 12866



This rule was reviewed under E.O. 12866. The rule was determined to not be a significant rule under the criteria of E.O.
12866 and, therefore, was not reviewed by OMB.

Fire- and gas-detection system.

 (i) Fire (flame, heat, or smoke) sensors shall be installed in all enclosed classified areas. Gas sensors shall be
installed in all inadequately ventilated, enclosed classified areas. Adequate ventilation is defined as ventilation
that is sufficient to prevent accumulation of significant quantities of vapor-air mixture in concentrations over
25 percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL). One approved method of providing adequate ventilation is a change of
air volume every 5 minutes or 1 cubic foot of air-volume flow per minute per square foot of solid floor area, whichever
is greater. Enclosed areas (e.g., buildings, living quarters, or doghouses) are defined as those areas confined
on more than four of their six possible sides by walls, floors, or ceilings more restrictive to air flow than grating
or fixed open louvers and of sufficient size to allow entry of personnel. A classified area is any area classified Class
I, Group D, Division 1 or 2, following the guidelines of API RP 500.

out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing procedures. Personnel shall monitor the bypassed or blocked-out
functions until the safety devices are placed back in service. Any surface or subsurface safety device that is temporarily
placed out of service shall be flagged. When conducting repairs or maintenance that expose the production safety
system to the atmosphere or to conditions that constitute a potential danger to safety of personnel or protection
of the environment, the system shall be purged of hydrocarbons and flow shall be blocked from the area under repair
or maintenance. Valves, pumps, or other equipment that could initiate flow through the designated area shall also
be flagged and removed from service. The activation of such equipment from the control panel shall be temporarily
precluded. Only the person in charge of the repair or maintenance may authorize the resumption of service. This authorization
may not be given until the repair or maintenance action is completed.

comply with this section, where applicable. 

(1)(i) Incoming pipelines to a platform shall be equipped with a flow safety valve (FSV). 

(ii) For sulphur operations, incoming pipelines delivering gas to the power plant platform may be equipped with high-
and low-pressure sensors (PSHL), which activate audible and visual alarms in lieu of requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i)
of this section. The PSHL shall be set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the normal operating
pressure range. 

(2) Incoming pipelines boarding to a production platform or delivering gas to a power plant platform shall be equipped
with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) below the lowest production deck of the platform. The SDV shall be connected
to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems. 

(3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production platforms shall be protected by PSHL to directly or
indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal
operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above the pipeline's maximum allowable operating
pressure. 

(4) Departing pipelines from a production platform shall be equipped with an SDV below the lowest production deck
of the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems in a manner that
allows the safe shut in of the platform prior to SDV closure. 

(5)(i) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with an SDV on both the
incoming and departing lines below the lowest production deck. These SDVs shall be connected to the automatic- and
remote-emergency shut-in systems. 

(ii) Crossing pipelines on unmanned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with an FSV. 

(6) Bidirectional pipelines servicing production or manned nonproduction platforms shall be equipped with a PSHL
and an SDV on all risers.

(8) For facilities and pipelines installed prior to the effective date of these regulations, an SDV shall be installed
when riser maintenance or repair is performed.

(9) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous
volumetric comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the deliveries onshore. The system shall
include an alarm system and shall be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and discharge volumes.
In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of
the Regional Supervisor.

(10) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a block valve and a FSV. Bidirectional pipelines
connected to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.

(11) Gas-lift or water-injection pipelines on unmanned platforms need only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately
upstream of each casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the wellhead.

(12) Pipeline pumps shall comply with Section A7 of API RP 14C. The setting levels for the PSHL devices are specified
in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

(c)(1) If the SDV or other required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service on pipelines
that are continued in operation, an equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The affected safety equipment
shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating that the equipment is rendered ineffective
or removed from service.

(2) When conducting repairs or maintenance to the pipeline system components that expose the pipeline to the atmosphere
or to conditions that constitute a potential danger to safety of personnel or protection to the environment, the system
shall be purged of hydrocarbons and flow shall be blocked from the area under repair or maintenance. Valves, pumps,
or other equipment that could allow or initiate flow through the designated area shall also be flagged and removed
from service. Activation of this equipment from the control panel shall be temporarily precluded. Only the person
in charge of the repair or maintenance may authorize the resumption of service. This authorization may not be given
until the repair or maintenance action is completed.

Administration of Grazing on Public Lands and National Forest System Lands




AGENCIES: 

Forest Service, USDA and Bureau of Land Management, Interior.




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; notice of hearings and informational meetings. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document provides notice of public hearings in which the public is invited to comment on regulations proposed
by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Forest Service, relating to the administration of grazing on the public
lands administered by the BLM and on National Forest System lands. These hearings will also provide the public an opportunity
to comment on a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Rangeland Reform '94. Immediately preceding the hearings,
BLM and the Forest Service will sponsor informational meetings on the proposed regulations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The United States Department of the Interior is proposing to amend the regulations which govern how the BLM administers
livestock grazing on the public lands. A proposed rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on Friday, March 25, 1994 (59 FR 14314). The proposed rule provides for a public comment period that runs until July
28, 1994. 

On April 28, 1994, the United States Department of Agriculture published similar proposed rules in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 22074, 22094) which govern how the Forest Service administers livestock grazing on National Forest System
lands. These proposed rules also provide for public comments to be received by July 28, 1994. 


In addition to the proposed rules, the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service, as cooperating agencies,
have prepared a draft EIS. The draft EIS is currently being printed and prepared for distribution. Notice of availability
of the draft EIS will be made through a separate publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


During the preparation of the BLM proposed rule, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt met on a number of occasions throughout
the West with governors, State and local officials, ranchers, environmentalists and other public land users. These
meetings resulted in many useful suggestions that are reflected in the proposed rule. In order to continue this important
communication with user groups and members of the public, and to further elicit valuable comments on the proposed
rules of both Departments and the draft EIS, the BLM and Forest Service have jointly scheduled 49 public hearings to
be held throughout the United States on June 8, 1994. 



Hearing Procedures 




The purpose of the hearings is to provide the public an alternate method by which to comment on the proposed rules and
the EIS. The hearings do not replace the public comment period described in the proposed rules. All members of the public
may submit comments in accordance with the procedures set forth in the proposed rules and are encouraged to do so. 


The hearings will be preceded by informal general information sessions which will begin at 8 a.m. in each location.
The purpose of these sessions is to allow the public an opportunity to learn more about the proposed rules and EIS. BLM
and Forest Service personnel will be present to describe the key elements of the proposals, and to answer questions
so that those who wish to testify at the hearings will fully understand the proposals. These sessions are not part of
the hearing and will not appear as part of the hearing record.

The hearings themselves will begin at 10:30 a.m. and continue until 5 p.m., with a lunch recess to be determined by the
Hearing Officer. The hearings will resume at 7 p.m. and will continue until 10 p.m. or thereafter until all speakers
have been heard. 
In order to have productive and meaningful hearings and to ensure that those who wish to speak at the hearings are able
to do so in a fair and orderly manner, the following procedures will be observed:



_Persons wishing to testify must register at the hearing site between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Speakers will be heard in the
order in which they register, with the exception of elected Federal, state or local officials, who will speak first
at the beginning of each session or as otherwise arranged with the Hearing Officer. 
_Each person may present testimony only once. However, if time permits, the Hearing Officer may allow each speaker
additional time after all other witnesses have had the opportunity to speak. When provided, such additional time
will be granted to speakers in the same order in which they originally testified. 
_Because a large number of speakers is anticipated, it will be necessary to limit the amount of time of each speaker.
Since the number of speakers may vary greatly from location to location, the time allocated to each speaker may also
vary among the hearings. However, within any one hearing, all speakers will be allocated an equal amount of time. The
amount of time allocated to each speaker will be left to the discretion of the Hearing Officer. Time limitations will
be strictly followed. 
_The purpose of the hearings is to elicit comments from the public. A technical representative from the BLM and Forest
Service will be present to ask clarifying questions of witnesses. Time spent asking and answering these questions
will not count against the time allocated to the speaker. Because of the time constraints and the desire to maximize
public input, the technical representatives will not respond to questions from or otherwise engage in discussions
with the speaker. Speakers who wish to ask questions should do so during the informal information session. 
_A transcript of the hearing will be made and become part of the rulemaking record. Speakers are encouraged to submit
a written copy of their statements to be included in the hearing record. The record of the hearing will remain open through
June 13, 1994 for submission of supplemental written statements or other exhibits. The name and address of the designated
official to receive these statements or exhibits will be announced at the hearing.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
Epoxy Resins Production and Non-nylon Polyamides Production 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of public hearing. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The proposed standard would limit emissions of 
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from existing and new 
facilities that manufacture polymers and resins produced 
from epichlorohydrin feedstock, specifically, basic liquid 
epoxy resins (BLR) and non-nylon polyamide resins, also 
known as wet strength resins (WSR). The proposed standards 
implement section 112(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act) 
amendments of 1990, which require the Administrator to 
regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants listed in 
section 112(b) of the Act. The intent of these standards is 
to protect the public by requiring new and existing major 
sources to control emissions to the level achievable by the 
maximum achievable control technology (MACT), taking into 
consideration the cost of achieving such emission 
reductions, any nonair quality and other air quality related 
health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements.

I. List of Source Categories 



Section 112 of the amended Act requires that EPA 
evaluate and control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP 
is achieved through promulgation of emission standards under 
sections 112(d) and 112(f) and work practice and equipment 
standards under section 112(h) for categories of sources 
that emit HAP. On July 16, 1992, EPA published an initial 
list of major and area source categories to be regulated 
(57 FR 31576). Included on that list were major sources 
emitting HAP from epoxy resins and non-nylon polyamides 
production. 

The categories of major sources that would be affected 
by this regulation are defined as the manufacture of basic 
liquid epoxy resins (BLR) and resins made of epichlorohydrin 
(EPI) cross-linked non-nylon polyamides, also known as wet 
strength resins (WSR). The BLR source category does not 
include the manufacture of specialty epoxy resins (epoxy 
resins that are not BLR) or the modification of epoxy resins 
(BLR that are blended with solvents, reactive diluents, or 
other resins). The WSR source category are those that are 
made with dibasic esters, dicarboxylic acids, amines, and 
EPI. In developing the background information to support 
the proposed standard, no reasons for subcategorizing either 
of the source categories were identified. 

Production methods used in the two source categories 
include both batch and continuous operations. The sizes of 
the facilities range from those that make several thousand 
pounds of resin per year (lb/yr) to those that produce over 
100 million lb/yr. Air emissions of HAP compounds originate 
from breathing and working losses from storage tanks, 
venting of process vessels, leaks from piping equipment used 
to transfer HAP compounds (equipment leaks), and 
volatilization of HAP from wastewater streams. Pollutants 
(HAP) emitted from the production processes include EPI, 
methanol, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Detailed information 
describing manufacturing processes and emissions can be 
found in ``Emissions from Epoxy Resins Production and Non- 
Nylon Polyamides Production_Background Information for 
Proposed Standards'' (EPA 453/R-94-033a), Chapter 3. 

As of 1990, only three U.S. companies were producing 
BLR. All three of these facilities are considered to be 
major sources according to the Act criterion of having the 
potential to emit 10 tons per year of any one HAP or 25 tons 
per year of combined HAP. There are at least 17 facilities 
in the U.S. that manufacture WSR; of these, 9 are considered 
major sources because they are co-located within larger 
chemical manufacturing operations, based on the criteria 
mentioned above. The proposed standard would apply to all 
major sources that produce BLR and/or WSR. Area sources 
would not be subject to this standard. 



II. Background 



In 1989, EPA conducted a study that examined the use of 
epichlorohydrin in industry. This study identified the BLR 
and WSR industries as the major users of epichlorohydrin in 
the U.S. 

Under section 112(c) of the Act, the Administrator is 
required to publish and from time to time revise a list of 
source categories and subcategories that emit one or more of 
the hazardous air pollutants listed in section 112, as 
amended. Information from the study of epichlorohydrin use 
in industry was used during the development of the source 
category list. On July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576), the EPA 
published the initial list of source categories, which 
includes epoxy resins production and non-nylon polyamides 
production. 



III. Authority for National Emission Standards for 
Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) Decision Process 



A. Source of Authority for NESHAP Development 



Section 112 of the Clean Air Act gives the 
Environmental Protection Agency the authority to establish 
national standards to reduce air emissions from sources that 
emit one or more HAP. Section 112(b) contains a list of HAP 
to be regulated by NESHAP. Section 112(c) directs the 
Agency to use this pollutant list to develop and publish a 
list of source categories for which NESHAP will be 
developed; this list was published in the 

Federal Register

 
on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). The Agency must list all 
known categories and subcategories of ``major sources'' 
(defined below) that emit one or more of the listed HAP. A 
major source is defined in section 112 (a) as any stationary 
source or group of stationary sources located within a 
contiguous area and under common control that emits or has 
the potential to emit in the aggregate, considering 
controls, 10 tons per year or more of any one HAP or 25 tons 
per year or more of any combination of HAP. 



B. Criteria for Development of NESHAP 



The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions 
from both new and existing sources according to the 
statutory directives set out in section 112(d) of the Act. 
The statute requires the standards to reflect the maximum 
degree of reduction in emissions of HAP that is achievable 
for new or existing sources. This control level is referred 
to as the ``maximum achievable control technology'' (MACT). 
The selection of MACT must reflect consideration of the cost 
of achieving the emission reduction, any nonair quality 
health and environmental impacts, and energy requirements 
for control levels more stringent than the floor (described 
below).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The MACT floor is the least stringent level for MACT 
standards. For new sources, the standards for a source 
category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than 
the emission control that is achieved in practice by the 
best controlled similar source, as determined by the 
Administrator'' (section 112(d)(3)). Existing source 
standards should be no less stringent than the average 
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
12 percent of the existing sources for categories and 
subcategories with 30 or more sources or the average 
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 
5 sources for categories or subcategories with fewer than 
30 sources (section 112(d)(3)). 

In a March 9, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice reopening 
the public comment period for determination of ``MACT floor'' 
for NESHAP source categories (59 FR 11018), the Agency 
considered more than one interpretation of the statutory 
language concerning the MACT floor for existing sources and 
solicited comment on them. The MACT floor decision that the 
EPA will make on the basis of this March 9, 1994 notice will 
have broad precedential effects, and will presumptively be 
followed by the Agency in any rulemakings subsequently 
promulgated under Title III of the Act. The MACT floor 
determinations proposed in today's rulemaking may therefore 
be affected by the Agency's final interpretation of ``MACT 
floor.'' 



IV. Summary of Proposed Standards 



A. Source Categories To Be Regulated 



The proposed standards would regulate HAP emissions 
from epoxy resins production (facilities that produce BLR), 
and from non-nylon polyamides production (facilities that 
produce WSR), that are determined to be major sources. The 
standards would apply to existing sources as well as new 
sources. 



B. Pollutants To Be Regulated 



Hazardous air pollutants emitted from existing BLR and 
wet strength resin production processes include 
epichlorohydrin, methanol, and hydrochloric acid. The 
proposed standards would regulate emissions of these 
compounds, as well as any other HAP that may be emitted. 

In addition, note that epichlorohydrin is listed under 
section 112(r) of the Act. The intent of section 112(r), 
Prevention of Accidental Releases, is to focus on chemicals 
that pose a significant hazard to the community should an 
accident occur, to prevent their accidental release, and to 
minimize consequences should a release occur. 
Epichlorohydrin, along with the other substances listed 
under section 112(r)(3), is listed because it is known to 
cause, or may be reasonably anticipated to cause death, 
injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the 
environment (see 59 FR 4478, January 31, 1994). Sources 
that handle epichlorohydrin in greater quantities than the 
established threshold quantity under section 112(r)(5) will 
be subject to the risk management program requirements under 
Section 112(r)(7) (see 58 FR 54190, October 20, 1993). 



C. Affected Emission Points 



Emission points identified for BLR and wet strength 
resin production include process vents, equipment leaks, 
storage tanks, and wastewater. 



D. Format of the Standards 



The standards for process vents, storage tanks, and 
wastewater for existing facilities are presented in an 
emission limit format in the units of pounds of HAP per 
1 million pounds of product (lb HAP/MM lb product). 
Facilities will have the option of using any control 
technology or pollution prevention strategy, as long as the 
HAP production-based emission limits are achieved. An 
emission limit format cannot be used for the standard for 
new facilities because it would identify a specific 
facility's production level, which is claimed as 
confidential business information. Therefore, standards for 
new facilities are in the equipment standard format. 
Facilities would have to implement the controls specified in 
the standard, or demonstrate equivalency, to achieve 
compliance.

<TEXT>
 

The EPA solicits comments on the equipment standard 
format of the standards for process vents, storage tanks, 
and wastewater at new facilities. In particular, the EPA 
solicits comments on whether performance standards for 
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities can be used 
without compromising confidential business information and 
whether operators can comply with performance standards for 
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities without 
compromising confidential business information. 

Standards for equipment leaks are specified for new and 
existing BLR facilities, and are presented as an alternative 
standard for new and existing wet strength resin facilities. 
Equipment leak standards are in the form of equipment/work 
practice standards. Facilities would be required to 
implement the program specified in the proposed regulation 
to achieve compliance with the standard. 



E. Proposed Standards 



Table 1 summarizes the standards for existing BLR and 
WSR sources. In each case, for purposes of determining 
compliance with the emission requirements, the source was 
divided into two portions: (1) The combination of process 
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, and (2) equipment 
leaks. The proposed standards for BLR production would 
require existing facilities to limit emissions from all 
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater combined to a 
level at or below 130 lb HAP/MM lb production. Existing 
BLR facilities would also be required to implement the leak 
detection and repair (LDAR) program specified in the 
Negotiated Regulation for Equipment Leaks (40 CFR part 63, 
subpart H). The LDAR program specified under subpart H 
requires specific equipment modifications and work practices 
that reduce emissions from equipment leaks.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For new BLR facilities, the standards would be based on 
the technology used by the best performing facility in the 
category for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, 
which is the use of a 99 percent efficient water scrubber on 
all process vents coupled with recirculation of the scrubber 
effluent to the process, and 99 percent control of emissions 
from wastewater. As for existing facilities, new facilities 
would be required to implement the LDAR program of subpart H 
to control equipment leak emissions. 
For existing wet strength resin facilities, the 
proposed standards would require an emission limit of 10 lb 
HAP/MM lb product from process vents, wastewater, and 
storage tanks combined. No emission limits or equipment 
standards are required for equipment leaks; however, 
facilities may elect to implement the subpart H LDAR program 
in lieu of complying with the emission limit for process 
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, as this alternative 
would achieve a greater emission reduction. Similar to BLR 
production, for new wet strength resin facilities, the 
standards would be based on the technology used by the best 
performing source in the category. This technology is the 
use of a water-cooled condenser, from which the outlet gas 
temperature shall be no higher than 25 
 C, on the batch 
reactor and no methanol by-product formation or hydrochloric 
acid usage, or the implementation of the subpart H LDAR 
program to control equipment leak emissions. 


F. Certification of Compliance 


1. Existing sources 
a. 

Process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
emission points. 

To determine compliance with the emission 
limit for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
combined, the owner or operator of an existing BLR or WSR 
manufacturing facility would calculate the total emissions 
per product produced by summing the production-based 
emission values for process vents, storage tanks, and 
wastewater according to the following equation: 




E=

S

PV=

S

ST=

S

WW  (1) 

where: 
E=Emissions, lb HAP/10

6

 lb product 
PV=Process vent emissions, lb HAP/10

6

 lb product 
ST=Storage tank emissions, lb HAP/10

6

 lb product 
WW=Wastewater emissions, lb HAP/10

6

 lb product 




The required calculation methods for each type of emission 
point are described below for the BLR and WSR source 
categories.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

i. 

BLR source category.

 For basic liquid resin 
production, tests would be required to determine the flow 
rate and HAP concentration of emissions from process vents 
and, where applicable, storage tank vents that are combined 
with process vents. Data from three 1-hour tests would be 
used to calculate an average HAP emission rate in pounds per 
hour. Initial performance tests for uncontrolled streams or 
streams controlled by devices other than flares and certain 
boilers and process heaters would consist of measuring HAP 
concentration using the EPA Method 18 or Method 25A of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Method 25A may be used only if a 
single HAP compound greater than 50 percent of the total 
organic HAP in the vent stream and that HAP compound is used 
for calibration. Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A is specified for measuring vent stream flowrate. 

To determine the production-based emission rate for 
process vents, the owner or operator would calculate an 
hourly rate of production based on production data for the 
previous year and the actual operating hours during the same 
annual period. For each vent, the hourly emission rate, 
determined from the average of three 1-hour tests, would be 
divided by the hourly production rate (calculated as 
described above) to determine the production-based emission 
rate for the vent. The sum of production-based emission 
rates from all process vents (and storage tank vents if 
manifolded with process vents) constitutes the first term in 
the equation used to determine compliance. Because 
emissions are divided by the annual production of the 
previous year, testing must take place under operating 
conditions that represent the production rate for the 
previous year. 

Emissions from storage tanks not manifolded with 
process vents would be calculated according to the 
methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The annual 
emissions would be divided by the annual production from the 
previous year to determine the production-based emission 
rate from storage tanks. 

Emissions from wastewater would be calculated according 
to the methodology described in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). 
Monthly emissions calculated using this methodology would be 
divided by a monthly production rate, which would be 
calculated by dividing the annual production rate for the 
previous year by 12. Testing is required by 
40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) to determine wastewater stream 
parameters such as the flow rate and HAP concentration. 
Because emissions would be divided by a production rate 
calculated using production data for the previous year, test 
conditions must reflect typical production for the previous 
year. 

ii. 

WSR source category.

 If a process uses a 
condenser to recover HAP, emissions would be calculated for 
the purpose of determining compliance using equations 
developed for batch operations, in lieu of compliance tests. 
Testing would be required to determine the emission rate 
from uncontrolled vents and vents controlled by devices 
other than condensers. Testing requirements are the same as 
for the BLR source category, except that testing would take 
place over the batch cycle, rather than hourly. Likewise, 
the production-based emission rates used in the equation to 
determine compliance would be calculated based on emissions 
and production data obtained on a per-batch basis, not per-hour as is the case for the BLR source category. 

As with the BLR source category, storage tank emission 
calculations would follow the methodology described in 
40 CFR 63.150(f)(3). The methodology of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5) 
would be used to determine emissions from wastewater. 

b. 

Equipment leaks emission point.

 To determine 
compliance with the standard for equipment leaks, BLR and 
WSR facilities would have to demonstrate that an LDAR 
program meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart H (40 CFR 63.160-63.183) is in place. This includes 
performance of the test methods and procedures used to 
verify the adequacy of monitoring equipment outlined in 
40 CFR 63.180. 



2. New Sources 


a. 

BLR source category.

 Although the proposed 
standards for new BLR sources are essentially equipment 
standards, control efficiencies are required for the 
equipment specified in the standards. Therefore, in 
addition to installing the equipment required by the 
standards, new BLR facilities would be required to perform 
the appropriate EPA test methods to demonstrate that the 
common water scrubber required to control emissions from 
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater is achieving 
99 percent control. The testing methodology described in 
40 CFR 163.150(f)(5) would be required to demonstrate that 
wastewater treatment systems are achieving 99 percent 
control. 

b. 

WSR source category.

 The equipment standards for 
new WSR facilities do not specify any control efficiencies 
that must be achieved. Therefore, facilities would only be 
required to demonstrate operation of a water-cooled 
condenser at an outlet temperature of 25 
 C, that no 
methanol is being produced during the manufacturing process, 
and that no hydrochloric acid is being used to produce WSR. 



G. Monitoring Requirements 



Monitoring is required by the proposed standards to 
determine whether a BLR or wet strength resin process is in 
compliance. This monitoring is done either by: 
(1) Continuously measuring outlet mass flowrate and 
concentration, or by (2) continuously measuring a site-specific operating parameter, the value of which is 
established by the owner or operator during the initial 
compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined 
as the minimum or maximum value established for a control 
device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or 
in combination with one or more other operating parameter 
values, determines that an owner or operator is complying 
with the applicable emission limitation or standards. A 
summary of the monitoring requirements of the proposed 
standards is provided in Table 2.

H. Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements 


The owner or operator of any BLR or wet strength resin 
source subject to these standards would be required to 
fulfill all reporting requirements outlined in the General 
Provisions to 40 CFR part 63. 


V. Summary of Environmental, Energy, Cost, and 
Economic Impacts 


A. Facilities Affected by These NESHAP 


These NESHAP would affect BLR and WSR facilities that 
are major sources in themselves, or constitute a portion of 
a major source. There are three existing manufacturers of 
BLR, all of which were assumed to be major sources for the 
purpose of developing these standards. (Final determination 
of major source status occurs as part of the compliance 
determination process). Of the 17 existing facilities that 
manufacture WSR, 9 were assumed to be considered major 
sources. The expected growth rate for the BLR industry and 
the wet strength resin industry is expected to be between 2 
and 3 percent through 1995. Impacts associated with the 
control options are presented in Table 3 and Table 4; the 
options selected as proposed standards are footnoted.

B. Air Impacts 



The proposed standards would reduce HAP emissions from 
existing BLR sources by 95 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) 
(105 tons per year [tons/yr]) from the baseline level, a 
reduction of 78 percent from baseline. Emissions of HAP 
from existing wet strength resin sources would decrease by 
2 Mg/yr (2 tons/yr) if facilities elect to comply with the 
MACT floor, a reduction of 7 percent from baseline. If 
facilities elect to implement the alternative standard for 
the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater source, HAP 
emissions would decrease by 14 Mg/yr (15 tons/yr), a 
reduction of 52 percent from baseline. 



C. Water and Solid Waste Impacts 



The proposed standards will result in the generation of 
3,200,000 gallons of wastewater per year from the BLR source 
category, assuming gas absorbers (water scrubbers) are 
installed to control process vents and storage tank 
emissions. This amount of wastewater represents 
approximately 10 percent of the wastewater currently 
generated at the BLR production facility and a small portion 
of the total wastewater from the plant. EPA believes the 
additional wastewater can be treated on-site in the plant's 
existing wastewater treatment system. Wastewater impacts 
may be less if an alternative control measure is used to 
comply with the standard. 

There is no wastewater generated from the WSR 
production process, because emissions are controlled with 
condensers. There is also no solid waste generated from the 
BLR or WSR production processes. 



D. Energy Impacts 



The proposed standards for the BLR source category 
would require an additional energy usage of 1.5 x 10

6

 Btu 
per year (Btu/yr). Additional energy usage for the WSR 
source category is 4 x 10

6

 Btu/yr if the MACT floor is 
implemented; however, if facilities elect to comply with the 
alternative standard, the additional energy usage is 
negligible. 



E. Cost Impacts 



The emission reductions that would be required by this 
regulation could be met using one or more of several 
different techniques. To determine costs, certain control 
scenarios were assumed. The scenarios used in costing were 
judged to be the most feasible scenarios possible for 
meeting the requirements of the proposed standards from a 
technical and cost standpoint. The total control cost 
includes the capital cost to install the control device, the 
costs involved in operating the control device, and costs 
associated with monitoring the device to ensure compliance. 
Monitoring costs include the cost to purchase and operate 
monitoring devices, as well as reporting and recordkeeping 
costs required to demonstrate compliance. 

The cost impacts of the proposed standards are 
summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. Nationwide, the total 
annual cost of this standard to the BLR industry is 
$140,000. 

The total cost of this regulation to the wet strength 
resin industry is $520,000, assuming all facilities do not 
decide to achieve compliance with the alternative standard 
(controlling equipment leaks). If all facilities 

do

 decide 
to comply with the alternative standard, the total annual 
cost is $52,000. 



F. Economic Impacts 



The economic impact analysis of this standard shows 
that the estimated price increase from compliance with the 
recommended alternative for process vents, storage tanks, 
and wastewater is 0.05 percent for BLR. Estimated reduction 
in market output for BLR is 0.08 percent. 

For WSR, control of equipment leaks is not required, 
but is allowed as an alternative standard because it 
achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or 
better than the MACT floor level of control for vents, 
tanks, and wastewater. Assuming compliance with the 
alternative standard for WSR, the estimated price increase 
is 0.22 percent and the estimated reduction in market output 
is 0.20 percent.

No plant closures are expected from compliance with 
this set of alternatives. For more information, consult the 
background information document for these standards (see the 


Background Information Documents

 section near the beginning 
of this preamble). 


VI. Rationale 


A. Selection of Emission Points To Be Covered by the 
Standards 


Emissions from BLR and WSR production occur from the 
following emission points: Storage tanks, process vents, 
equipment leaks, and wastewater. The proposed standards 
consider all of these emission points. Wastewater emissions 
from wet strength resin facilities are negligible, although 
they are included as an emission point. 


B. Designation of Sources 


For these proposed standards, a source is defined as 
all HAP emission points within a facility that are related 
to the production of BLR or WSR, including process vents, 
storage tanks, wastewater, and equipment leaks. For the 
purpose of developing the standards, the emission points 
included in the definition of the source are divided into 
two portions: 
1. All process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
emission points; and 
2. Equipment leaks. 

The Administrator considered proposing a single 
emission limit that would apply to process vents, storage 
tanks, wastewater and equipment leaks. However, equipment 
leaks cannot be included with process vents, storage tanks, 
and wastewater because: (1) The negotiated standard for 
equipment leaks has no fixed performance level; and (2) no 
method currently exists for determining the magnitude of 
allowable emissions to assign for leaks. Without a method 
to determine the magnitude of allowable emissions to assign 
for equipment leaks, an averaging policy that included 
equipment leaks would be difficult to enforce. Therefore, 
the MACT floor and each regulatory alternative has two 
components_one for the combination of process vents, 
storage tanks, and wastewater, and another for equipment 
leaks. When methods are developed to assign allowable 
emission levels for particular leak points, the EPA will 
consider revising these standards to allow inclusion of 
equipment leaks in the emission limit. 

The Administrator also considered proposing separate 
emission limits for each type of emission point, but 
determined that this approach was not feasible because 
tanks, and wastewater emission points are intertwined by 
existing control strategies. For example, in existing BLR 
facilities, process vents and storage tank emissions are 
manifolded together and controlled using a common device. 
The device commonly used to control these emissions is a 
water scrubber, which functions in transferring potential 
HAP emissions from gaseous point sources to a wastewater 
emission source. Therefore, a single emission limit is 
proposed for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater 
combined to give facilities flexibility in complying with 
the standard. Specifying a single emission limit for this 
combination of emission points gives facilities the latitude 
to determine the best way for them to achieve emission 
reductions. Separate regulatory options were identified for 
equipment leaks for the reasons described at the beginning 
of this section. 


C. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards 
for Existing Sources 


1. BLR Source Category 


Because there are three existing facilities in the U.S. 
that produce BLR (all three are believed to be major 
sources), EPA used the average of the total production-based 
emission factors achieved by the three facilities to 
determine the MACT floors. Using this method, the 
production-based emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product 
was established as the MACT floor for the process vents, 
storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source based on 
information from BLR facilities. 
Existing BLR facilities control equipment leak 
emissions using various leak detection and repair (LDAR) 
programs. The impacts associated with the MACT floor and 
regulatory alternatives for sources at existing BLR 
facilities are presented in Table 3. 
Regulatory Alternative II represents the highest level 
of control identified for existing BLR sources. Because the 
MACT floor for the process vents, storage tanks, and 
wastewater portion of the source reflects a high level of 
control (the use of water scrubbers, carbon adsorbers, 
refrigerated condensers, and flares on process and storage 
tank vents, and biodegradation to reduce emissions from 
wastewater), only one area was identified as a possible 
additional controlled emission point: the generation of 
HAP-containing scrubber effluent, which is normally routed 
to the facility's wastewater treatment system. This 
wastewater could be controlled by recirculating scrubber 
effluent to the process. This measure would result in an 
emission limit of 125 lb HAP/MM production. Therefore, 
this emission limit was chosen for Regulatory Alternative II 
for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion 
of the source. The control method proposed for the 
equipment leaks portion of the source was to implement the 
LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H, which 
represents a higher level of control than is currently 
practiced by any existing BLR facility.

<TEXT>
 

In evaluating Regulatory Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy).
Regulatory Alternative II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative
I (2 Mg/yr [2 tons/yr]) is not significant considering the associated cost. Water and energy impacts were examined;
however, because the magnitude of these impacts were small, they were not a major factor in the decision to reject Regulatory
Alternative II. 

The first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor (Regulatory Alternative I) considered for existing BLR sources
was to implement the LDAR program specified in 40 CFR 63, subpart H to control the equipment leaks portion of the source,
and to require the MACT floor emission limit of 130 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater
portion. The LDAR program of subpart H would achieve a higher level of control than the MACT floor; also, the cost of
this control option was judged to be reasonable (see Table 3). Therefore, the Administrator selected Regulatory
Alternative I as the standard for existing BLR sources. 



2. WSR Source Category 



The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for existing wet strength resin facilities was calculated
based on data supplied by the nine major sources making up this source category. The MACT floor represents the average
value of the lowest five production-based emission totals from major sources in the industry. For the process vents,
wastewater, and storage tanks portion of the source, the emission limit is 10 lb/MMlb production. Because no existing
facility in the WSR source category controls equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion
of the source represents an uncontrolled situation. Impacts associated with the MACT floor and regulatory alternatives
for sources at existing wet strength resin facilities are presented in Table 4. 

Regulatory Alternative II, the most stringent alternative identified for existing WSR sources, would require an
emission limit of 5 lb HAP/MM lb product for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source,
as well as requiring the subpart H LDAR program for the equipment leaks portion of the source. In evaluating Regulatory
Alternative II, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water, and energy). Regulatory Alternative
II was rejected because the incremental emission reduction over Regulatory Alternative I, (1 Mg/yr) is not significant
considering the associated cost. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
II; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative II. 

Regulatory Alternative I, the first regulatory alternative above the MACT floor for existing WSR sources, would
require the MACT floor emission limit of 10 lb HAP/MM lb production for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater
portion of the source, and the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of
the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, cost, water,
and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged
this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I. 

Because both Regulatory Alternatives were judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed for both the combined
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks portions of existing
WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of the subpart H LDAR
program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for existing WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program represents
an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source, with
significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR program
was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or better than
that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and wastewater and because costs
of implementation of this LDAR program are in many cases much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring compliance
with the emission limit (see Table 4).

D. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards for New Sources 



1. BLR Source Category 



For new sources, the MACT floor shall be no less stringent than the level representing the best controlled similar
source. For new BLR sources, the MACT floor for the portion of the source consisting of the combination of process vents,
storage tanks and wastewater is achieved by: (1) Routing process vents and storage tank vents to a common water scrubber
with an efficiency of 99 percent; (2) recirculating scrubber effluent back to the process, and (3) Controlling HAP
emissions from wastewater by 99 percent. This strategy represents a 99 percent emission reduction for this portion
of the source. No regulatory alternatives more stringent than the new source MACT floor could be identified for this
portion of new BLR sources. 

The MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion of new BLR sources is the LDAR program of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV. 

Regulatory Alternative I for new BLR sources would require sources to implement the subpart H LDAR program to control
equipment leaks, in addition to the MACT floor requirement for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater. The
subpart H LDAR program represents a cost-effective control option for equipment leaks with significant emission
reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. For these reasons, the Administrator chose
Regulatory Alternative I as the proposed standard for new BLR sources. 



2. WSR Source Category 



The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for new wet strength resin facilities is achieved
by equipping the batch reactor with a cooling water condenser, and by operating the process without the use of hydrochloric
acid and prohibiting the formation of methanol. This represents the highest level of control that is technically
feasible. Therefore, no regulatory alternatives above the MACT floor could be identified. 

Because no existing facility in the WSR source category is controlling equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor represents
an uncontrolled situation. Regulatory Alternative I for new WSR sources is the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part
63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of the source (the same as for existing facilities), and the MACT floor
equipment standard described in the previous paragraph for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion
of the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, costs, water,
and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged
this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative
I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I. 

Because the only Regulatory Alternative above the MACT floor was judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed
for both the combined process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks
portions of new WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of
the subpart H LDAR program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for new WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program
represents an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source,
with significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR
program was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or
better from that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and water and because
costs of implementation of this LDAR program are expected to be much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring
compliance with the emission limit.

E. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Standards 



The formats of the proposed standards were selected in 
order to give facilities the most flexibility possible in 
achieving the level of control required by the selected 
regulatory alternative. Because the MACT floor for the 
process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the 
source reflects control by various methods, the format needs 
to allow sufficient flexibility for facilities to meet the 
level of the standard using the various control methods 
already in place to the extent possible. 

Of the formats considered (mass emission limits, 
percent concentration, percent reduction, equipment 
standards, work practice standards), the mass emission limit 
format was chosen because various combinations of controls 
can be employed among several emission points to achieve the 
same mass emission rate. Also, mass emission limits 
encourage facilities to reduce emissions through process 
changes, work practice changes, and other methods to avoid 
costly add-on controls. In this way, mass emission limits 
serve to encourage pollution prevention. An equipment 
standard format is not needed for this source because an 
emission limit can be established. Formats such as 
specifying a concentration or a percent reduction, offer no 
advantages over the emission limit format, and would be more 
cumbersome from an enforcement standpoint due to the 
different characteristics of the emission points that make 
up the source of process vents, storage tanks, and 
wastewater. 

For process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission 
points within new sources, however, equipment standards have 
been proposed. An emission limit format cannot be used for 
these emission points within new sources because it would 
identify specific facilities' production levels, which are 
claimed as confidential business information. However, 
facilities would have the opportunity to employ other 
technologies to meet the standard by demonstrating 
equivalence. 

The EPA solicits comments on the equipment standard 
format of the standards for process vents, storage tanks, 
and wastewater at new facilities. In particular, the EPA 
solicits comments on whether performance standards for 
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities can be used 
without compromising confidential business information and 
whether operators can comply with performance standards for 
vents, tanks, and wastewater at new facilities without 
compromising confidential business information. 

The LDAR program of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H is a 
combination of an equipment standard/work practice format. 
Under section 112 of the Act, national emission standards 
must, whenever possible, take the format of a numerical 
emission standard. Typically, an emission standard is 
written in terms of an allowable emission rate, performance 
level, or allowable concentration. These types of standards 
require the direct measurement of emissions to determine 
compliance. For some emission points, emission standards 
cannot be prescribed because it is not feasible to measure 
emissions. Section 112(h)(2) recognizes this situation by 
defining two conditions under which it is not feasible to 
establish an emission standard. These conditions are: 
(1) If the pollutants cannot be emitted through a conveyance 
designed and constructed to emit or capture the pollutant; 
or (2) if the application of measurement methodology is not 
practicable due to technological and economic limitations. 
If an emission standard cannot be established, the EPA may 
instead establish a design, equipment, work practice, or 
operational standard or combination thereof. 

For equipment leak emission points, such as pumps and 
valves, EPA has previously determined that it is not 
feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Except 
for those items of equipment for which standards can be set 
at a specific concentration, the only method of measuring 
emissions is total enclosure of individual items of 
equipment, collection of emissions for a specified time 
period, and measurement of the emissions. This procedure, 
known as bagging, is a time-consuming and prohibitively 
expensive technique considering the great number of 
individual items of equipment in a typical process unit. 
Moreover, this procedure would not be useful for routine 
monitoring and identification of leaking equipment for 
repair. Therefore, LDAR program of 40 CFR, subpart H, an 
equipment/work practice standard, was chosen for the 
equipment leaks emission point. 



F. Selection of Compliance and Performance Testing 
Provisions and Monitoring Requirements 



The proposed regulation contains compliance provisions 
that require owners or operators to conduct an initial 
performance test to demonstrate compliance with the proposed 
standards. As a means of demonstrating compliance with the 
standards following the initial performance test, the owner 
or operator must also establish source-specific parameters 
based on the characteristics of the emission stream, 
process, or type of control device used. The Administrator 
determined that these provisions were necessary to meet the 
monitoring requirements of the General Provisions (40 CFR 
part 63, subpart A).

1. Testing and Monitoring 



Compliance is comprised of 
initial performance testing and continuous compliance 
verification, or monitoring. The proposed requirements for 
initial compliance testing and any periodic or continuous 
measurement to verify ongoing compliance are based on the 
emission stream characteristics that would be encountered 
either at the outlet of the control device or at the point 
of release to the atmosphere for uncontrolled emission 
streams. Often, an important factor to consider in 
evaluating emission stream characteristics is the type of 
control device that is preceding the emission stream. Also, 
the operating parameters of the device can be used as an 
indicator of the level of control of the device and 
therefore, the outlet emissions. The selection of 
appropriate test methods for initial and ongoing compliance, 
therefore, is related to both the characteristics of the 
stream and to the type of device used to control it. The 
discussion of both factors is presented below. 



2. Emission Stream Characteristics 



An important 
characteristic to consider when evaluating measurement 
methods are whether the streams are from continuous sources 
or whether they are from batch sources. Streams that are 
from continuous sources would have minimal variation in 
characteristics; the test measurement method therefore can 
be intermittent in nature. For example, flowrate and 
concentration can be sampled on an intermittent basis to 
obtain an average emission value that presumably will not 
vary significantly. Batch emission streams, however, are 
expected to have wide variation in flowrate, composition, 
and conditions throughout the course of a batch (i.e., with 
time). Often, proportional sampling of flowrate and 
composition over the course of a batch to arrive at a total 
emission number over the entire batch is necessary. 
Alternatively, simultaneous measurement of flowrate and 
composition must be made to arrive at an instantaneous 
emission rate. Because these methods are difficult, an 
initial compliance test requiring concentration measurement 
is not recommended for most batch operations. Specifically 
for these NESHAP, equations are provided in the regulation 
to determine HAP emissions from the batch reactor used in 
WSR production. 

A second important characteristic of the emission 
stream to consider during selection of a test method is the 
composition. If organic material other than HAP are 
contained in the stream, it may be necessary to speciate the 
stream or at least identify the HAP constituents in the 
stream. This identification limits how continuously the 
stream can be sampled. The most common technology that will 
be used in identification is gas chromatography, specified 
in EPA Reference Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. 
Gas chromatography, coupled with the quantification of 
material typically done with a flame-ionization device 
(FID), EPA Reference Method 25A, can be done at sub-minute 
intervals, but not continuously. However, if identification 
of organic species is not necessary, an FID alone can be 
used. This technology will provide a continuous reading of 
concentration. 



3. Control Devices
 



The devices used to abate HAP 
emissions will affect the outlet stream composition and 
conditions and therefore affect the degree of confidence of 
the initial and continuous compliance methods. Devices that 
are commonly used in the basic liquid resins and WSR 
industry to control process vents and storage tank emissions 
are condensers, gas absorbers (water scrubbers), carbon 
adsorbers, and flares. These devices differ from one 
another in the type of streams that they control and the 
outlet conditions of the streams. 

i. 

Condensers. 

In the case of condensers, which are 
usually applied to saturated emission streams and by design 
yield saturated streams, it can be assumed that the 
components will be present at levels corresponding to their 
saturated values (equilibrium) at the outlet conditions. 
This measure provides a worst-case estimate of emissions. 
Therefore, the direct measurement of concentration often may 
be foregone in lieu of the measurement of stream temperature 
and flow rate and subsequent calculation to yield mass 
emissions. For wet strength resin batch reactors, this is 
the required measurement to determine HAP concentration in 
both initial and continuous performance tests. Because the 
emission streams controlled by condensers in basic liquid 
resin manufacturing will be more likely to have multiple 
sources with numerous components that will affect the 
ability to predict HAP concentrations by measurement of 
secondary parameters, the direct measurement of 
concentration is required at least in the initial 
performance test. Thereafter, concentration measurements to 
establish continuous compliance may be reasonably 
approximated with a measurement of outlet gas temperature.

ii. 

Gas Absorbers. 

Gas absorbers (water scrubbers), 
however, differ in that there is no parameter that can be 
measured and used to establish a limit of HAP concentration. 
Often, the streams routed to scrubbers are more dilute, and 
the control device functions in not only changing the 
conditions of the gas temperature like a condenser would do, 
but in employing concentration gradients to remove materials 
from gas streams. In order to predict the performance of a 
gas absorber, information must be known about the 
appropriate mass transfer coefficients for the specific 
system. Most often, the mass transfer coefficients are 
experimentally derived for specific applications and are 
usually functions of the mass velocities and contacting path 
variables. While it is possible to calculate the scrubber 
outlet compositions without mass transfer information by 
assuming that the amount of material transferred to the 
liquid is limited by the equilibrium-defined composition, 
this information is not indicative of the physical scrubber 
because it does not provide for the evaluation of the 
contacting path. Therefore, a direct measurement of 
composition is required during the initial performance test. 
Evaluation of continuous compliance need not be done by 
continuous direct measurement of HAP concentration from the 
scrubber effluent, however. Another parameter, the liquid 
to gas molar ratio through the scrubber, could be monitored 
to ensure required removal. The L/G ratio, which often 
reduces to the measurement of L, the liquid molar flow rate, 
because G, the gas molar flow rate is often constant, could 
be measured during the initial performance test to evaluate 
the sensitivity of the ratio with removal efficiency. 
Thereafter, the L/G ratio could be used to verify 
appropriate removal if the ratio remained within the limits 
established during the initial compliance test. 

iii. 

Carbon Adsorbers. 

Streams controlled by carbon 
adsorption will usually be diluted, compared to those 
controlled by condensers and scrubbers. No surrogate 
parameters have been identified as measures of HAP 
concentration or removal efficiencies. Therefore, a direct 
measurement of concentration will be required during the 
initial performance test as well as in continuous compliance 
monitoring. 

iv. 

Flares. 

Compliance testing for flares can be 
complicated by the formation of undesired products of 
combustion (including HAP) and the inability to further 
capture and control these byproducts. Nevertheless, if a 
facility chooses to use a flare as a control device, EPA has 
established flare combustion efficiency criteria that 
specify that 98 percent or greater combustion efficiency can 
be achieved provided that certain operating conditions are 
met. If a HAP is formed from combustion, the quantity 
formed must be considered when calculating control 
efficiency. These conditions prescribe that the flare must 
be operated with no visible emissions and with a flame 
present and that the heating value and exit velocity of the 
gas routed to the flare must be within certain ranges, 
depending upon whether the flares are steam-assisted. 

Additionally, the NESHAP general provisions provide for 
an initial performance test to determine whether the net 
heating value will fall within the applicable ranges for 
control at 98 percent. The performance test involves 
measuring the incoming gas flowrate and the concentration of 
combustible compounds (40 CFR 63.11) to determine net 
heating value. However, it appears that as the number of 
compounds in the stream increases, the determination of the 
net heating value becomes increasingly difficult. Also, in 
light of the fact that flares are often used to control 
discontinuous or upset conditions, the net heating value at 
any one time is subject to change. Continuously measuring 
the concentration of combustible compounds to determine 
heating value on a continuous basis is probably not 
feasible. Therefore, the enhanced monitoring method chosen 
for these standards is to require that the presence of a 
pilot flame be monitored continuously. Also, an initial 
measurement and characterization of the inlet mass emissions 
to the flare is required for two reasons:

<TEXT>
 

1. To determine the fraction of hazardous air 
pollutant emissions that are being controlled by the flare; 
and 

2. To determine the net heating value of the vent 
stream. 

v. 

Wastewater. 

Because air emissions from wastewater 
treatment systems cannot be collected and measured, certain 
parameters must be identified that indicate the emission 
rate from wastewater for monitoring purposes. The proposed 
methods for estimating wastewater emissions for initial 
compliance with the proposed standards for the emission 
source of process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater, as 
well as for identifying enhanced monitoring parameter values 
for wastewater, are those specified in 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). 
The requirements of 40 CFR 63.150(f)(5) consist of 
monitoring specific wastewater treatment parameters and 
emission calculation methods. Monitoring of the following 
wastewater parameters is required: inlet flow rate, HAP 
concentration, pH, and biological oxygen demand. These 
parameters were chosen for monitoring because they can be 
used to determine wastewater treatment system performance. 

vi. 

Storage Tanks. 

Storage tank emissions vary greatly over time, which 
prohibits testing over reasonable periods of time. 
Therefore, no initial compliance test is proposed for this 
emission point, unless emissions are manifolded with process 
vents, in which case the compliance tests specified for 
process vents apply. Instead, the methods specified in 
40 CFR 63.150(f)(3) are proposed to calculate emissions. 
Emissions would be calculated based on the facility's 
solvent usage records for the most recent 1-year period and 
divided by the amount of product produced during the same 
period. A 1-year period is necessary to reduce the effect 
of variation in solvent usage on the emission calculation. 
Because emissions are calculated from factors, and because 
storage tank emissions are not dependent on parameters that 
can be controlled, no continuous monitoring requirements are 
proposed for this emission point, except that facilities 
that control storage tank emissions must certify that such 
controls are in proper working order. 

vii. 

Equipment Leaks. 

Like wastewater emissions, equipment leak emissions 
occur in open areas and in most cases cannot feasibly be 
captured. Therefore, no performance test is required for 
the equipment leaks source. Instead, facilities must 
demonstrate that they have an LDAR program in place that 
meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 63, subpart H. No 
monitoring requirements are proposed for equipment leaks, as 
the proposed standard for equipment leaks is a work 
practice/equipment standard. 



5. Averaging Times 



i. 

Initial compliance. 

The standards for the process 
vents, storage tanks, and wastewater source at existing BLR 
and WSR production facilities are in the form of mass 
emission limits. Initial compliance is determined by adding 
the emissions per unit mass of product calculated for each 
process vent, storage tank, and wastewater emission point 
within the facility. For BLR production, a continuous 
process, a 1-hour averaging time is specified for process 
vent compliance tests; the emission rate would be the 
average of the results of three 1-hour tests. For WSR 
production, typically a batch operation, the emission rates 
used to determine compliance would be the average of 3 tests 
taken over for 3 different batch runs. Longer averaging 
times are required for batch operations to minimize the 
effect of emissions that vary significantly with time. 

Storage tank emissions would be averaged over a period 
of 1 year, based on HAP usage records from the previous 
year, to minimize the effect of variation in solvent usage 
on the calculated emission rate. A monthly averaging time 
is required for wastewater, as specified in 
40 CFR 63.150(f)(5). Different averaging times are possible 
for different emission types because emissions are divided 
by the production rate for an equal time period. The 
resulting production-based emissions are then added together 
according to Equation 1 and compared with the mass emission 
limit to determine compliance.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

ii. 

Monitoring. 

In accordance with  63.8(c)(4) of 
the General Provisions, all continuous monitoring systems 
measuring either emissions or an operating parameter shall 
complete a minimum of one measurement cycle (sampling, 
analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute 
period. 



BLR source category. 

For BLR manufacturers, the 
determination of compliance varies for each type of control 
or capture system. Owners and operators complying with the 
standard by using carbon adsorbers, condensers, 
incinerators, and total enclosures on continuous processes 
may be determined to be out of compliance with the standard 
if, for any 1-hour period, the average operating parameter 
value exceeds or is less than the value established during 
the initial performance test, as applicable. A 1-hour 
averaging time is chosen to determine compliance because it 
parallels the length of time for each of the three test runs 
conducted for the initial performance test. 



WSR source category. 

Wet strength resins are produced 
in batch processes, during which emissions may vary 
significantly. Therefore, longer averaging times are 
necessary for WSR processes than for BLR processes. The 
averaging time proposed for WSR processes is the time 
required to complete one batch operation (typically about 8 
hours). Because producers of WSR do not vary the production 
process from batch to batch, emissions data averaged over 
the course of one batch operation would be representative of 
the actual emissions from future batch runs. 


G. Selection of Reporting and Recordkeeping 
Requirements 




The owner or operator of any BLR or wet strength resin 
facility subject to these standards would be required to 
fulfill all reporting requirements outlined in the General 
Provisions 40 CFR part 63. No special considerations have 
been identified for these industries that would warrant 
additional reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 



H. Operating Permit Program 



Under Title V of the Act, all HAP-emitting facilities 
will be required to obtain an operating permit. Oftentimes, 
emission limits, monitoring, and reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements are scattered among numerous provisions of 
State implementation plans (SIP's) or Federal regulations. 
As discussed in the proposed rule for the operating permit 
program published on May 10, 1991 (58 FR 21712), this new 
permit program would include in a single document all of the 
requirements that pertain to a single source. Once a 
State's permit program has been approved, each facility 
containing that source within that State must apply for and 
obtain an operating permit. If the State wherein the source 
is located does not have an approved permitting program, the 
owner or operator of a source must submit the application 
under the proposed General Provisions of 40 CFR part 63. 



VII. Administrative Requirements 



A. Public Hearing 



A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss 
the proposed standard in accordance with section 307(d)(5) 
of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishing to make oral 
presentation on the proposed standards for epoxy resins 
production and non-nylon polyamides production should 
contact EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of 
this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 
15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a 
written statement before, during, or within 30 days after 
the hearing. Written statements should be addressed to the 
Air Docket Section address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of 
this preamble and should refer to Docket No. A-92-37. 

A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written 
statements will be available for public inspection and 
copying during normal working hours at EPA's Air Docket 
Section in Washington, DC (see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this 
preamble). 



B. Docket 



The docket is an organized and complete file of all the 
information submitted to or otherwise considered by EPA in 
the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal 
purposes of the docket are:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. To allow interested parties to readily identify and 
locate documents so that they can intelligently and 
effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and 

2. To serve as the record in case of judicial review 
(except for interagency review materials 
(section 307(d)(7)(A))). 



C. Executive Order 12866 



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory 
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of 
this Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant 
regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule 
that may: 

1. Have an annual effect of the economy of 
$100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way 
the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 

2. Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise 
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

3. Materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the 
rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or 

4. Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of 
legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the 
principles set forth in this Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has 
notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant 
regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive 
Order. EPA has submitted this action for OMB review. 
Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or 
recommendations will be documented in the public record. 



D. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this 
proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. An 
Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been 
prepared by EPA (ICR No. 1681.01), and a copy may be 
obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 
401 M Street SW., (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by 
calling (202) 260-2740. The public reporting burden for 
this collection of information is estimated to average 600 
hours per source, including time for reviewing instructions, 
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining 
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection 
of information. 

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any 
other aspect of this collection of information, including 
suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information 
Policy Branch, 2136, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: 
Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any 
OMB or public comments on the information collection 
requirements contained in this proposal. 



E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) 
requires EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed 
regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary 
analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a 
significant economic impact on 20 percent or more of small 
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be 
prepared. 

Regulatory Flexibility Act guidelines for regulations 
like this one whose start action notifications (SAN's) were 
filed before April 1992 indicate that an economic impact 
should be considered significant if it meets one of the 
following criteria: 

1. Compliance increases annual production costs by 
more than 5 percent, assuming costs are passed onto 
consumers; 

2. Compliance costs as a percentage of sales for small 
entities are at least 10 percent more than compliance costs 
as a percentage of sales for large entities; 

3. Capital costs of compliance represent a 
``significant'' portion of capital available to small 
entities, considering internal cash flow plus external 
financial capabilities; or 

4. Regulatory requirements are likely to result in 
closure of small entities. 

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator 
certifies that this rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
All of the affected BLR and WSR producers are large enough 
not to satisfy the criteria for a small business. 
Consequently, no significant small business impacts will 
result from compliance with these standards. 



F. Miscellaneous 



In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication 
of this proposal was preceded by consultation with 
appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and 
Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator will 
welcome comments on all aspects of the proposed regulation, 
including health, economic and technical issues, and on the 
proposed test methods. 

This regulation will be reviewed 8 years from the date 
of promulgation. This review will include an assessment of 
such factors as evaluation of the residual health and 
environmental risks, any overlap with other programs, the 
existence of alternative methods, enforceability, 
improvements in emission control technology and health data, 
and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Spark-ignition Engines at or Below 19 Kilowatts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Today's action proposes emission standards for new 
nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts (25 
horsepower). This action is authorized by section 213(a)(3) of 
the Clean Air Act as amended. The proposed standards are 
expected to result in a 32 percent reduction in hydrocarbon 
emissions and a 14 percent reduction in carbon monoxide emissions 
from these engines by the year 2020 when complete fleet turnover 
is projected.

A. Statutory Authority 



Authority for the actions proposed in this notice is granted to EPA by sections 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 213,
215, 216, and 301(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C. 7522, 7523, 7524, 7525, 7541, 7542, 7543,
7547, 7549, 7550, and 7601(a)). 

CAA section 213(a) directs EPA to: (1) Conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles; (2) determine
whether emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO

X

), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from nonroad engines and vehicles are significant contributors to ozone
or CO concentrations in more than one area that has failed to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for ozone and CO; and (3) regulate those categories or classes of new nonroad engines and vehicles that, in EPA's judgment
cause or contribute to such air pollution. Under CAA section 213(a)(4), EPA may also regulate emissions other than
CO, NO

X

, and VOCs from new nonroad engines and vehicles if EPA determines that such other emissions significantly contribute
to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The 
Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study (hereafter, ``Nonroad Study'') required by section 213(a)(1) was completed
in November 1991. The Nonroad Study is available in docket A-91-24. The determination of the significance
of emissions from nonroad engines and vehicles in more than one NAAQS nonattainment area, required by section 213(a)(2),
was proposed on May 17, 1993 (58 FR 28809) and is incorporated by reference into this proposal. At the same time, the
first set of regulations for a class or category of nonroad engines that contribute to air pollution, required by section
213(a)(3), was proposed (58 FR 28809) for new nonroad compression-ignition (CI) engines at or above 37 kilowatts
(kW). Today's action continues to implement section 
213(a)(3); it proposes emission standards for nonroad spark-ignition (SI) engines at ornd below 19 kW (25 horsepower)
(hereafter, ``small SI engines''), another class or category of nonroad engines that contributes to air pollution.

Background 



On the basis of the Nonroad Study, EPA has proposed its determination that emissions of CO, NO

X

, and VOCs from nonroad engines and vehicles contribute significantly to ozone or CO in more than one NAAQS nonattainment
area (see 58 FR 28809, May 17, 1993). According to the Nonroad Study, nonroad engines and vehicles contribute an average
of ten percent of summer VOCs in the 19 ozone nonattainment areas included in the study. Small SI engines are the source
of half of those nonroad summer VOC emissions. In the 16 CO nonattainment areas included in the study, nonroad engines
and vehicles account on average for nine percent of winter CO emissions. Small SI engines are the source of 56 percent
of the nonroad winter CO contribution, according to the study. 

Since March 1992, EPA has held several public workshops and meetings to solicit information on technical characteristics,
emissions, potential regulatory strategies, and general regulatory issues related to small SI engines. Public
notice of such meetings may be found in the docket for this rulemaking. 

At the March 1992 public workshop, the Engine Manufacturers Association and the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute
encouraged federal regulation of nonhandheld small SI engines and expressed interest in working in a cooperative
program with EPA to develop regulations by November 1993. Likewise, the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers
Association encouraged federal regulation of portable 2-stroke power equipment and expressed interest in working
cooperatively with EPA. 

Industry's interest in federal regulation of small SI engines may be traced to California's efforts to develop a statewide
regulatory program. CAA section 209(e)(2) authorizes California to enforce emission standards for certain nonroad
engines if: (1) California determines that such standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public
health and welfare as applicable Federal standards, and such standards are not arbitrary and capricious, (2) California
needs such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions, and (3) California standards and accompanying
enforcement procedures are consistent with section 209(e)(2). (See 58 FR 45866, September 6, 1991, for EPA's Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking for implementing section 209(e). This rulemaking is ongoing and the exact criteria for EPA
granting an authorization to California will be prescribed in the final section 209(e) rule. Definitions of farm
and construction equipment are also provided in this section 209(e) rule.) CAA section 209(e)(2) also authorizes
other states to opt into California standards. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has adopted standards for
nonroad lawn and garden and utility SI and CI engines from 0-25 horsepower (0-19 kilowatts). EPA is currently
reviewing CARB's section 209(e) authorization request for its lawn and garden and utility rule. A decision will be
issued once EPA's section 209(e) procedural rule is finalized. There is potential for other states to adopt the California
standards, which are scheduled to become effective in 1995, if EPA decides to approve California's waiver request.


Following the March 1992 workshop, EPA determined that setting emission standards for the small SI engine category
might be suitable for a consultative approach to rulemaking, such as negotiated rulemaking. The Negotiated Rulemaking
Act (5 U.S.C. 581-590) establishes a framework for conducting negotiated rulemaking. Under that Act, in deciding
whether to conduct a negotiated rulemaking, the head of an agency must consider several factors, including whether,
at the preproposal stage of development, the number of identifiable parties who would come to the negotiating table
is relatively limited, the number of specific issues for which sufficient information and technology is in hand for
resolution is limited, and a time-forcing factor exists that lends an air of urgency to issuance of the rule in question.
Negotiations are conducted through a committee chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.
II section 9(c)). The goal of a regulatory negotiation committee is to reach consensus on the language or issues involved
in a rule. If consensus is reached, it is used as the basis of the Agency's proposal. 

EPA initiated a convening process to determine the best way to work with industry and other interested parties in developing
regulations for small SI engines. The conveners interviewed individuals in leadership roles in key organizations
identified by EPA to determine what parties were interested in these regulations, what issues were important to interested
parties, and whether a consultative rulemaking process would be feasible and appropriate. A copy of the convening
report, dated August 24, 1992, is available in the docket for this rulemaking. 

The convening report recommended an exploratory meeting of interested parties to discuss, but not initiate, a consultative
process. EPA determined that the number of parties who would come to the negotiating table would be relatively limited,
the number of specific issues for resolution would be limited, sufficient information and technology would be in
hand or could be timely developed for resolution of issues, and time-forcing factors existed. (See 58 FR 34389, June
25, 1993, for a complete discussion of the application of the factors in this case.) Time-forcing factors lending
an air of urgency to issuance of the rule include the potential threat to industry of patchwork regulation if a number
of states opt into California's program in order to attain national air quality goals. More recently, an air of urgency

The exploratory meeting recommended in the convening report was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan on November 16-17,
1992. Participants decided that state and public interest representatives needed more technical information to
fully understand some of the regulatory issues participants might face. It was also decided that another meeting
was necessary to discuss the potential design of a consultative process for a small SI engine rulemaking. The technical
briefing for state and public interest representatives was conducted in Ann Arbor on December 16, 1992. On January
28-29, 1993, a meeting to discuss consultative process design was held in Ann Arbor. 

At the January meeting, it was suggested that EPA consider a two-phased approach to regulation of small SI engines.
In the suggested first phase, EPA would propose regulations for new small SI engines through the normal regulatory
process rather than a consultative process. It was suggested that Phase 1 regulations could be similar to California's
Regulation for 1995 and Later Utility and Lawn and Garden Equipment Engines, modified as necessary to meet CAA requirements.
(For example, EPA's proposal could modify CARB's program by including engines preempted from regulation in California.)
The Phase 1 proposal would be completed as soon as possible, but no later than the spring of 1994. The final rule would
be promulgated no later than spring of 1995. The suggested second phase of regulation could be developed through the
consultative process of regulatory negotiation. It could include issues such as useful life, in-use emissions,
evaporative emissions, refueling emissions, test procedure, and market-based incentive programs. Negotiations
could begin in Fall 1993 and continue for approximately 18 months. 

EPA has decided to proceed with the phased approach. Today's action proposes the first phase of regulation for new
small SI engines. The data that supports the proposed emission standards and the technology, cost, and benefits assessments
for this proposal are outlined herein and in the draft Regulatory Support Document (RSD), a copy of which is located
in the public docket for this rulemaking. EPA does not currently have sufficient data to establish useful life standards
or an in-use liability program. However, rather than lose the potential early emission benefits while EPA develops
the data necessary to establish useful life and in-use liability, EPA is choosing to claim those early benefits in
this first phase of new small SI engine regulation and to continue developing the data necessary for the second phase
of small SI engine regulation. EPA believes that the potential for early benefits to public health and the environment
provided by the first phase of emission standards is of sufficient magnitude to postpone determinations of useful
life and in-use liability until the second phase of rulemaking. The phased approach to regulation of small SI engines
is incorporated in the 

Sierra Club

 v. 

Browner

 settlement, a copy of which is available in the public docket for this rulemaking. 



IV. Requirements of the Proposed Rule 



The general provisions of this rule, as well as the rationale for the key parts of this proposal, are briefly described
in the following section. 



A. Overview 



EPA proposes to regulate emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), NO

X

, and CO from certain new nonroad spark-ignition engines that have a gross power output at and below 19 kW.
 A spark-ignition engine is an internal combustion engine in which the air/fuel mixture is ignited in the combustion
chamber by an electric spark.

The scope of this rule would encompass a broad range of 
small SI engine applications, including farm and construction 
equipment, which individual states are preempted from regulating 
under section 209(e)(1) of the CAA. Exclusions from the rule are 
detailed below. 

Under this proposal, exhaust emissions from new small SI 
engines could not exceed levels for a given engine class as 
listed in Table 1. Engine classes would be specified both by 
engine displacement, as measured in cubic centimeters (cc), and 
by the type of equipment the engine powered_either handheld or 
nonhandheld. Five engine classes are being proposed today. 
Each has a unique set of emission standards. Nonhandheld engine 
classes would be: Class I_engines less than 225 cc in 
displacement; and Class II_engines greater than or equal to 225 
cc in displacement. Engines powering equipment defined as 
handheld would be classified as Class III, IV, or V: Class III_engines less than 20 cc in displacement; Class IV_engines
equal 
to or greater than 20 cc and less than 50 cc in displacement; and 
Class V_engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in displacement. 
Emission standards being proposed today are considered Phase 1 
new small SI engine standards. 






The rule would explicitly exclude from regulation the 
following small SI engines: 

(1) Engines used to propel marine vessels as defined in the 
General Provisions of the United States Code, 1 U.S.C. 3 
(1992). A ``vessel'' includes every description of watercraft 
or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being 
used, as a means of transportation on water. 1 U.S.C. 3 
(1992). 

(2) Engines used in underground mining or engines used in 
underground mining equipment and regulated by the Mining 
Safety and Health Administration (MHSA). See 30 CFR parts 
7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. 

(3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart E. 

(4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 
87.1(a). 

(5) Engines used in recreational vehicles, which are defined as 
engines which have no installed speed governor and which 
have a rated speed of greater than or equal to 5,000 
revolutions per minute (RPM). Engines used in recreational 
vehicles are not used to propel marine vessels and do not 
meet the criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V 
engine under this rule. 

This rule proposes the following regulatory scheme: 

 Designation of product lines into groups of engines with 
similar emission characteristics (such groups are called 
engine families), 
 Manufacturer emission testing of selected engines with a 
specified test procedure to demonstrate compliance with new 
engine emission standards, 
 Labeling of engines, and alternatively, equipment labeling 
if the engine label becomes obscured when placed in the 
equipment, 
 Submission of an application for certification for each 
engine family, 
 Inclusion of various certification requirements such as the 
prohibition of defeat devices, 
 Issuance of an emission certificate of conformity for each 
engine family, 
 Prohibition against offering for sale in the United States 
engines not certified by EPA, 
 Requirement that equipment manufacturers use the appropriate 
handheld or nonhandheld certified engine in their equipment, 
 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, 
 EPA Administrator testing provisions, 
 Design warranty provisions and prohibition on tampering,

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Inclusion of all farm and construction engines, state 
regulation of which is preempted under the CAA, 
 Development of an engine manufacturer's program to evaluate 
in-use emission deterioration, 
 Requirement that if catalysts are used in an engine family, 
catalyst durability must be confirmed by means of the evaluation procedure that is specified in this notice, 
 Defect reporting and voluntary recall, 
 Importation provisions, 
 General prohibitions and enforcement provisions, and 
 Production line Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA). 
Certain elements of EPA's on-highway program are not being 
proposed for this Phase I rule including: 
 No certification requirement for engine durability demonstration, 
 No performance warranty, 
 No averaging, banking, and trading program, and 
 No useful life determination and no in-use enforcement. 



B. General Enforcement Provisions 



EPA, as authorized in the CAA, would enforce nonroad 
standards in a manner similar to on-highway standards. Section 
213(d) of the Act provides that the standards promulgated under 
213 ``shall be subject to sections (206, 207, 208, and 209), with 
such modifications of the applicable regulations implementing 
such sections as the Administrator deems appropriate, and shall 
be enforced in the same manner as standards prescribed under 
section (202).'' Section 206 specifies requirements for motor 
vehicles and motor vehicle engine compliance testing and 
certification; section 207 requires manufacturers to warrant 
compliance by motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines in actual 
use; section 208 requires recordkeeping by manufacturers of new 
motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines and authorizes EPA to 
collect information and require reports; and section 209 preempts 
states and political subdivisions from adopting or enforcing 
standards relating to emission control, certification, or 
inspection of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, 
unless specifically authorized to do so by EPA. 

Pursuant to this authority, EPA is proposing in today's 
action regulations that require manufacturers of new small SI 
engines to obtain certification and that subject them to 
Selective Enforcement Auditing. Any manufacturer of a new small 
SI engine would be responsible for obtaining from the 
Administrator a certificate of conformity covering any engine 
introduced into commerce in the United States. 

The Agency is also proposing certain prohibited acts and 
general enforcement provisions similar to those for on-highway 
vehicles under sections 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA. 

Section 203 specifies prohibited acts; section 204 provides 
for federal court injunctions of violations of section 203(a); 
section 205 provides for assessment of civil penalties for 
violations of section 203; and section 208 provides the Agency 
with information collection authority. The general enforcement 
language of section 213(d) provides the Agency's authority for 
applying section 203, 204, 205, and 208 of the CAA to new small 
SI engines and equipment. 

As applied to nonroad engines, vehicles and equipment under 
section 213(d), Phase 1 prohibited acts would include, but would 
not be limited to: 
 An engine manufacturer's introduction into commerce of new small SI engines that are not covered by a certificate
of 
conformity issued by EPA, 
 The introduction into commerce of new small SI equipment and 
vehicles which do not incorporate the appropriate 
nonhandheld or handheld certified nonroad engine, 
 Tampering with emission control devices or elements of 
design installed on or in a small SI engine, and 
 Failure to provide information to the Agency if requested. 






EPA is also proposing regulations, under the authority of section 
205 of the Act, which set forth the maximum statutory penalties 
for violating the prohibitions. 



EPA is proposing general information collection provisions 
similar to current on-highway provisions under section 208 of the 
Act which would include, but would not be limited to, the 
manufacturer's responsibility to provide information to EPA, 
perform testing if requested by EPA, and maintain records. In 
addition, EPA is proposing emission system defect reporting 
regulations which require manufacturers to report to EPA emission 
system-related defects that affect a given class or category of 
engines. EPA enforcement personnel would be authorized to gain 
entry and access to various facilities under section 208 and 
today's action proposes these entry and access provisions.

<TEXT>
 

This rule's information requirements are similar to those 
proposed in the nonroad large compression-ignition (CI) rule,
 
but reduced from the on-highway program requirements. EPA 
requests comment on whether patterning the small SI engine 
information requirements after the nonroad large CI rule is 
appropriate for the manufacturers of small nonroad engines. In 
particular, EPA request comments on whether there are more 
efficient or more effective ways than those proposed for 
manufacturers to create, maintain, and report this information; 
whether electronic data interchange (EDI) is a common practice 
within this industrial sector; and whether EPA should consider 
using EDI or any other technology in its information collection 
to reduce the burden and costs of compliance. 





EPA is authorized under section 217 of the CAA to establish 
fees to recover compliance program costs associated with section 
206 and 207. EPA will propose to establish fees for today's 
nonroad compliance program at some future time, after this rule 
has been promulgated and associated costs are determined. 



C. Program Description and Rationale 



This section describes several features of EPA's proposed 
Phase 1 small SI engine, vehicle and equipment compliance program 
and EPA's rationale for including these features in the program. 
Specific issues related to the proposed program which require in- 
depth discussion are presented in ``V. Discussion of Issues.'' 



1. Applicability 



This rule would apply to new nonroad spark-ignition engines 
that have a gross power output at or below 19 kW and are 
manufactured after August 1, 1996 for use in the United States. 
New engines that would be covered by this rule are used in a 
large and varied assortment of vehicles and equipment including 
lawnmowers, string trimmers, edgers, chain saws, commercial turf 
equipment, small construction equipment, and lawn and garden 
tractors. 

EPA estimates that in the first year of regulation 
approximately 16,525,000 new engines, or approximately 19.4 
percent of the in-use fleet, would be subject to this regulation. 
See Chapter 4 of the draft Regulatory Support Document 
(hereafter, draft RSD) for this rulemaking.
 






EPA is proposing to require certification of new small SI 
engines, not the vehicle or equipment which houses such engines. 
First, small SI engines are used in a variety of applications. 
EPA believes it is inappropriate to mandate that a specific SI 
engine be manufactured for any given application. Second, the 
number of manufacturers and the diversity of vehicles and 
equipment in which small SI engines are used would present clear 
administrative problems. Regulating primarily by vehicle or 
equipment type would dramatically increase administrative cost 
associated with this rule with no comparable reduction in 
emissions. EPA is, however, proposing to require that vehicle 
and equipment manufacturers and importers use the appropriate 
certified nonroad engines in their vehicles and equipment. This 
requirement is discussed in ``V.H. Requirements Applicable to 
Vehicle and Equipment Manufacturers.'' 

EPA also considered, but rejected, the idea of including SI 
engines above 19 kW in this Phase 1 rule. Engines above the 
proposed 19 kW cutoff tend to exhibit different operating cycle 
characteristics than small SI engines. This difference 
necessitates the development of additional test procedures. EPA 
does not have sufficient data to undertake such a development 
within the timeframe of this Phase 1 rule. As part of the 

Sierra 
Club 

v. 

Browner

 settlement, EPA will determine by November 1996 
whether to undertake a rulemaking which targets emissions from SI 
engines over 19 kW. 

Certain small SI engines which otherwise would be subject to 
this rule would be explicitly excluded from regulation: 

(1) Engines used to propel marine ``vessels'' as such term is 
defined in 1 U.S.C. 3 (1992). EPA is not including these 
engines because they are currently subject to safety 
regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard (See 46 U.S.C. 331 and 
46 U.S.C. 4302.), and EPA is developing a separate 
rulemaking which will propose appropriate methods of 
regulating emissions from these engines. 

(2) Engines regulated by the Mining Safety and Health 
Administration (MSHA) for underground use. EPA is not 
including in this proposal engines that are used in 
underground mining or engines used in underground mining 
equipment as regulated by MSHA under the authority of 30 CFR 
parts 7, 31, 32, 36, 56, 57, 70, and 75. MSHA is 
responsible for protecting miners from unhealthy levels of 
air pollution in underground mines and has issued air 
quality standards for mines and standards for NO

X

 and CO 
emissions from some types of mining equipment. Although EPA 
considered applying EPA regulations to these engines, EPA 
chose not to include them at this time in order to avoid 
dual regulation of these engines. 

(3) Engines used in motorcycles and regulated in 40 CFR part 86, 
subpart E. EPA has regulated emissions from motorcycles 
since 1978. A motorcycle means any motor vehicle with a 
headlight, taillight, and stoplight and having two wheels or 
three wheels and a curb mass less than or equal to 680 
kilograms.

<TEXT>
 

(4) Engines used in aircraft as that term is defined in 40 CFR 87.1(a). 

(5) Engines used in recreational vehicles which are defined as 
follows: (1) The engine has no installed speed governor; 
(2) the engine's rated speed is greater than or equal to 
5,000 RPM; (3) the engine is not used for the propulsion of 
a marine vessel; and (4) the engine does not meet the 
criteria to be categorized as a Class III, IV, or V engine 
under this regulation. Recreational vehicles include: All-
terrain vehicles, off-road motorcycles, snowmobiles, and go-
karts. These engines are being excluded for several 
reasons: First, the duty cycle is completely different from 
most small SI engine applications. These engines experience 
highly transient operation and likely will require 
completely different test procedures for purposes of 
emission control testing. Second, they are designed to 
emphasize power output; thus, they are typically designed to 
run at much higher RPMs than other small SI engines. EPA 
invites comments on other criteria which may be utilized in 
defining the class of nonroad engines which propel 
recreational vehicles. 



2. Exclusions and Exemptions to Today's Proposal 



Pursuant to section 203(b)(1) of the CAA, the Agency is 
proposing additional categories of exemptions from new small SI 
engine regulation similar to the exclusions and exemptions that 
exist for on-highway engines and that have been proposed in the 
nonroad large CI engine rule. These include exemptions for 
purposes of research, investigations, studies, demonstrations, 
training, or for reasons of national security. Exemptions would 
be obtained either categorically, that is without application to 
the Administrator, or by submitting a written application to the 
Administrator. Export exemptions and manufacturer-owned engine 
exemptions would be granted without application. Testing 
exemptions, display exemptions, and national security exemptions 
would be obtained by application. 

Exclusions from this regulation include nonroad engines that 
are used solely for competition or for combat. 

Exemptions and exclusions are justified in these cases 
because the sources are limited in number or scope, so minimal 
environmental harm results; the particular use of the source is 
determined to further air quality research; and/or the exemption 
is vital to the security of the nation. (See 39 FR 10601, March 
21, 1974.) 



3. Effective Date for Certification 



EPA is proposing that certification of new small SI engines 
begin in 1996. Manufacturers of engines produced on or after 
August 1, 1996, would be required to obtain from the 
Administrator a certificate of conformity covering the engine 
family. The certificate would be obtained prior to selling, 
offering for sale, introducing into commerce, or importing into 
the United States the new engine. 

While the small SI engines affected by this proposal include 
a broad range of engine types, EPA believes that the effective 
date for the proposed standards is reasonable and technologically 
feasible and that engine manufacturers will be able to implement 
these regulations within the short lead time provided under this 
rule. This issue is discussed, in detail, in ``V.I. Effective 
Date.'' Further, an August 1, 1996 effective date is consistent 
with the Congressional mandate found in section 213(c) of the 
Clean Air Act which requires that, ``Standards * * * shall take effect 
at the earliest possible date considering lead time necessary to 
permit the development and application of the requisite 
technology * * *''
 


4. Emission Standards 



Section 213(a)(3) of the CAA states that nonroad emissions 
standards: 




* * * shall achieve the greatest degree of emission reduction 
achievable through the application of technology which the 
Administrator determines will be available for the engines 
or vehicles to which such standards apply, giving 
appropriate consideration to the cost of applying such 
technology within the period of time available to 
manufacturers and to noise, energy, and safety factors 
associated with the application of such technology. In 
determining what degree of reduction will be available, the 
Administrator shall first consider standards equivalent in 
stringency to standards for comparable motor vehicles or 
engines (if any) regulated under section 7521 of this title, 
taking into account the technological feasibility, costs, 
safety, noise, and energy factors associated with achieving, 
as appropriate, standards of such stringency and lead 
time * * *. 




The emission standards being proposed for this Phase 1 small 
engine regulation are listed in Table 1 in the Overview Section. 
The proposed emission standards result in significant emission 
reductions in the near term while work is going on to develop 
more stringent Phase 2 standards and while manufacturers work to 
design engines and equipment capable of meeting lower standards 
at a later date. 



EPA believes these proposed emission standards represent 
the greatest emission reductions achievable given the short lead 
time prior to this rule's effective date and the technology 
available during this period. Requiring more stringent Phase 1 
emission standards than those proposed today would necessarily 
delay implementation of new small SI engine standards by at least 
two years. This additional lead time would be needed to allow 
manufacturers time to redesign engines and equipment to 
accommodate requirements of more sophisticated technologies. 
Air quality benefits which will accrue under the proposed 
emission standards are large and meet the statutory criteria for 
nonroad standards required by the CAA. These benefits are 
discussed in Section VI of this preamble.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00090 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In determining the appropriate level of emission standards 
to propose, EPA initially considered, as required in the CAA, 
comparable motor vehicle standards. Due to technological 
constraints present in small engines, EPA believes that 
promulgating emission standards comparable with motor vehicle 
standards in a Phase 1 rule is not technologically achievable. 
See chapter 1 of the draft RSD for further discussion of small SI 
engine technological constraints. 

In proposing these emission standards, EPA has also 
considered potential safety and noise issues. Of concern is 36 
CFR 261.52 which directs the Forest Service to prohibit the 
operation or use of any handheld internal or external combustion 
engine without a spark-arresting device properly installed, 
maintained, and in effective working order. The Forest Service 
also requires that multipositional small engines used on federal 
park lands have exposed exhaust system surface temperatures not 
exceeding 550 
 C. Exhaust gas temperatures may not exceed 475 

 C. 

The type of engine changes EPA expects as a result of the 
proposed emission standards will not present a safety concern. 
Only catalytic converters designed to produce high conversion 
efficiencies can generate sufficient exotherms to raise exhaust 
system skin temperatures to a level that might present a safety 
problem. Manufacturers have indicated that they will not use 
catalytic converters to meet the proposed emission standards for 
most product lines. EPA estimates that up to 30 percent of 
engines in Class I may need low efficiency catalysts to meet the 
standards. However, one manufacturer stated that the exotherm 
generated by these low efficiency catalysts will not affect 
exhaust system skin temperatures sufficiently to warrant more 
advanced heat dissipation and heat shield technologies. 
Noise levels of small SI engines will not be allowed to 
increase as a result of the proposed emission standards. The type 
of engine changes EPA expects to see among current engine designs 
to meet the proposed emission standards are not expected to 
impact noise levels. The primary source of noise from nonroad 
small engines originates from combustion and the moving parts in 
the engine, such as the piston, valve train, and so forth. Noise 
from combustion is controlled primarily through the engine 
muffler. EPA believes the principal method to be used by all 
engine manufacturers to meet the proposed emission regulation 
will be leaner air/fuel ratios. Noise levels in future engines 
which meet the proposed regulations must, therefore, not exceed 
that of current production engines. 

EPA requests comment on the possible impact of this proposed 
regulation on both engine noise and safety. 

In EPA's judgment, section 213(a)(3)'s requirement that EPA 
regulate emissions from those classes or categories of new 
nonroad engines which cause, or contribute to concentrations of 
ozone in nonattainment areas allows EPA to set emission standards 
for HC, rather than VOCs in general, as EPA believes that HC 
emissions from small gasoline engines are those that cause or 
contribute to ozone nonattainment concentrations. In addition, 
regulating HC rather that VOCs would be consistent with on-
highway practice. EPA requests comment on this proposed 
approach. 

In the Nonroad Study, EPA described VOCs as any compounds 
containing carbon and hydrogen or containing carbon and hydrogen 
in combination with any other element which has a vapor pressure 
of 1.5 pounds per square inch absolute or greater under actual 
storage conditions. 

HCs contain both hydrogen atoms and carbon atoms but no 
other atoms and are a subset of VOCs. For small SI engines, 
based on engines tested by Southwest Research Institute under 
contract with EPA, HCs make up more than 99 percent of the VOCs 
emitted from these engines. Less than one percent of the 
measured VOC emissions are from constituents other than HC 
emissions (aldehydes and ketones were the measured non-
hydrocarbon constituents in this case). 

In general, the types of emission controls employed to 
reduce HC emissions also reduce emissions of non-hydrocarbon 
VOCs. Therefore, in the case of small SI engines, setting 
emission limits for HC emission accomplishes essentially the same 
overall reduction in VOC emission as would setting emission 
limits for VOCs. Of course reductions in the individual non- 
hydrocarbon VOC species varies, as does the individual 
hydrocarbon species. 



5. Engine Classes 



The category of small SI engines is very complex and 
comprises a wide range of engines used in a broad spectrum of 
equipment. EPA proposes to adopt a ``class'' structure for this 
Phase 1 regulation. In determining which class of emission 
standards a particular engine must meet, an engine's end use or 
application must be determined. This rule proposes two broad use 
categories_nonhandheld and handheld. Nonhandheld engines would 
be required to meet either Class I or Class II standards while 
handheld engines would have to meet either Class III, IV, or V 
emission standards. Once the applicable use category is 
determined, the engine class would be selected on the basis of 
engine displacement as measured in cubic centimeters (cc). 

Each engine class would have unique emission standards. EPA 
is proposing five engine classes: Class I_small nonhandheld 
engines less than 225 cc in displacement; Class II_small 
nonhandheld engines greater than or equal to 225 cc in 
displacement; Class III_small handheld engines less than 20 cc 
in displacement; Class IV_small handheld engines equal to or 
greater than 20 cc to less than 50 cc in displacement; Class V_ 
small handheld engines equal to or greater than 50 cc in 
displacement.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Class I engines are overwhelmingly found in lawnmowers. 
Class II engines primarily include engines used in generator 
sets, garden tractors, and commercial lawn and garden equipment. 

Only engines used in equipment defined as handheld would be 
allowed to meet Class III, IV, or V emission standards. Class 
III includes engines used in consumer handheld products, such as 
small string trimmers, edgers, and brush cutters. Class IV 
encompasses engines used in both residential and commercial 
settings and includes large trimmers, edgers, blowers, and chain 
saws. Class V includes a majority of engines utilized in 
commercial chain saws. 

EPA is proposing five separate engine classes based on a 
number of factors. First, some types of equipment are currently 
powered exclusively by 2-stroke engines. EPA estimates that as 
much as 90 percent of 2-stroke engines are utilized in handheld 
equipment. These current handheld 2-stroke engines incorporate 
a technology which is inherently more polluting than current 4-stroke engine technology and which results in 2-stroke
engines 
experiencing a higher concentration of hydrocarbons in their 
exhaust. EPA's view is that it is not technologically feasible 
to apply the nonhandheld Class I and II engine standards to 
handheld engines in this Phase 1 rule; therefore the need arises 
for Class III, IV, and V handheld engine standards. Differences 
in stringency between classes III, IV, and V are due to the fact 
that energy-specific emissions generally increase as engine size 
decreases. This principle is also true in the case of engines 
used in nonhandheld applications and meeting emission standards 
of either classes I or II. See discussion in the draft RSD. 
Finally, the engine classification approach for Phase 1 
harmonizes federal small engine regulations with California's 
lawn and garden regulations. 

In summary, it is EPA's view that the emission standards 
proposed today for handheld and nonhandheld engines and reflected 
in the five engine class categories represent the greatest 
emission reduction achievable for this Phase 1 rule. 



6. Handheld Engine Qualifications 



To qualify as a handheld engine under this proposal, the 
small SI engine would be required to meet at least one of the 
following three requirements: 

(1) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that is 
carried by the operator throughout the performance of its 
intended function(s). This is meant to encompass such equipment 
as lightweight leafblowers, trimmers (both string and hedge), and 
cutters. 

(2) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that 
must operate multipositionally, such as upside down and sideways, 
to complete its intended function(s). EPA intends this category 
to include all types of chain saws as well as items already 
listed in the first requirement. 

(3) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment for 
which the combined engine and equipment dry weight is under 14 
kilograms, no more than two wheels are present, and at least one 
of the following attributes is also present: 

(a) The operator must alternately provide support or carry 
the equipment throughout the performance of its intended 
function(s). This allows lightweight snowblowers that are 
carried up stairs, or edgers which are picked up and 
supported during operation to qualify for handheld status. 

(b) The operator must provide support or attitudinal 
control for the equipment throughout the performance of its 
intended function(s). This attribute will allow equipment 
such as lightweight tillers, augers, cutoff/concrete saws, 
and edgers to qualify for handheld status. 

(c) The engine is used exclusively in a hand-portable 
generator or pump. 


For purposes of this section ``support'' would mean that the 
operator holds the equipment in position so as to prevent it from 
falling, slipping, or sinking. It would not be necessary for the 
entire weight of the equipment to be borne by the operator. 
``Attitudinal control'' would mean that the operator regulates 
either the horizontal or vertical position of the equipment, or 
both. ``Carry'' would mean that the operator completely bears the 
weight of the equipment, including the engine. 

Section ``V.G. Definition of Handheld Engines'' provides 
additional discussion on this issue. EPA believes that this 
proposed handheld definition adequately covers those categories 
of engines which should be allowed to meet the less stringent 
handheld engine standards. 

EPA requests information regarding specific engine 
applications which are not clearly identifiable as handheld or 
nonhandheld under the proposed definition. EPA also requests 
alternative language which could be incorporated in this 
definition to clarify the distinction between handheld and 
nonhandheld. EPA is particularly concerned that manufacturers of 
2-stroke lawnmowers may attempt to qualify for handheld status 
utilizing the second requirement_multiposition operation. It is 
not EPA's intent that pushing a lawnmower up and down hills would 
qualify as multiposition operation. 



7. Standards for Classes I and II 



EPA is proposing to adopt one of two options under 
consideration for setting standards applicable to Class I and II 
engines. EPA requests comments on each of these options. 



Option 1: 

Phase 1 would adopt a combined HC + NO

X

 standard 
for engine classes I and II. While engines in classes I and II 
have high HC emission rates, most currently produce extremely low 
levels of NO

X

. Due to technological constraints of all small SI 
engines, HC reductions would generally come at the expense of 
increased NO

X

. See ``VII. Technology Assessment'' for a 
discussion of this phenomenon. However, the resultant overall 
increase in NO

X

 emission inventories would be slight relative to 
the NO

X

 produced by sources such as nonroad large CI engines. 
The sensitivity of NO

X

 emissions to HC control varies greatly 
between engine designs. EPA believes that a Phase 1 approach 
which allows incremental tradeoffs between HC and NO

X

 controls 
through a combined standard would be consistent with EPA's 
statutory mandate that nonroad engine emission standards reflect 
the greatest emission reductions achievable. See ``VII. 
Technology Assessment'' for further discussion. 
To meet the combined standard, a manufacturer would add its 
HC emission test result to the NO

X

 test result. This combined 
number would then be submitted to EPA. Individual levels of 
these pollutants would not be established. The manufacturer 
would also be required to meet this combined level during 
Administrator testing and the SEA enforcement program. EPA 
believes that this approach would be workable for a Phase 1 rule. 
Setting separate standards for HC and NO

X

 would be addressed in 
EPA's Phase 2 regulatory negotiations. For further discussion of 
this issue, see ``V. M. HC + NO

X

 Standard for Class I, II 
Engines.''

EPA is reluctant to set such a combined standard because it is extremely concerned that no precedent be set for promulgating
combined emission standards in future rulemakings. EPA's past practice has been to set separate pollutant standards.
EPA is considering the combined standard approach only for this Phase 1 small SI engine rule because of limited data
availability, the aggressive timeframe of this rule, and to harmonize with the California lawn and garden regulation.




Option 2:

 Under this option EPA would set separate Class I and II emission levels for HC and NOx. Based on information currently
available to EPA, the NOx standard would be approximately 136 percent higher than current new engine levels, while
the HC standard would be approximately equal to the 
difference between those levels and the HC + NO

x

 standards proposed in option 1. EPA requests comment on this specific option, including industry data which addresses
the appropriate level of both HC and NOx if separate standards were to be promulgated. 



8. Engine Family Categorization 



For the purpose of demonstrating emission compliance, EPA is proposing that manufacturers of small SI engines divide
their product line into groups of engines, called engine families, which are composed of engines having similar emission
characteristics. Small SI engine families would be determined by using the same criteria (type of fuel, method of
air aspiration, number of cylinders, and so forth) currently used to define on-highway motorcycle engine families.


To be placed in the same engine family, engines would be required to be identical in all the following applicable respects:


(1) Combustion cycle, 
(2) Cooling mechanism, 
(3) The cylinder configuration (inline, vee, opposed bore spacings, and so forth), 
(4) The number of cylinders, 
(5) The engine class, 
(6) The number of catalytic converters (location, volume, and composition), and 
(7) The thermal reactor characteristics. 

At the manufacturer's option, engines identical in all the above respects could be further divided into different
engine families if the Administrator determined that such engines were expected to have different emission characteristics.
This determination would be based on a number of features, such as the intake and exhaust valve or port size, the fuel
system, exhaust 
system, and method of air aspiration. 

EPA requests comment on the appropriateness of adding governed engine RPM range as a criterion for the determination
of an engine family. EPA is concerned that a wide-governed RPM spread in the same engine family, that is one engine configuration
has a no-load governed speed at 3,200 RPM and another engine configuration has a rated no-load governed speed of 2,200
RPM, may be a sufficient reason to break up one engine family into more than one engine family. 



9. Compliance With Emission Standards 



The test engine(s) representing an engine family would be required to demonstrate that emissions are less than or
equal to each separate emission standard. If a test engine exceeded any one emission standard in the applicable class,
the engine family would be deemed not in compliance with emission standards of that class. 

EPA is proposing that if catalysts are used in an engine family to meet the emission standards of this regulation, the
engine manufacturer must affirm that the durability of the catalysts has been confirmed on the basis of the evaluation
procedure that is specified in this notice. 



10. Useful Life Period, In-use Enforcement, and Development of an In-use Testing Program 



EPA is not proposing a small SI engine useful life period or an in-use enforcement program in today's proposal. However,
EPA believes that a critical element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines
that continue to meet emission standards throughout the engine's 
useful life. While section 213(d) of the CAA authorizes EPA to enforce emission standards in-use, EPA is proposing
to postpone setting a useful life period and an in-use enforcement program for small SI engines until the Phase 2 regulations
become effective and, instead, to require in this Phase 1 regulation that manufacturers test in-use engines. The
Phase 2 rulemaking 
for small SI engines is under a court-ordered deadline and must be promulgated by April 30, 1997. 

EPA is not proposing a Phase 1 useful life period for several reasons. Only limited testing data is currently available
on in-use performance of small SI engines. Additional data would be provided by the in-use testing program described
below. Second, EPA does not believe that emission controls 
proposed for Phase 1 will experience significant deterioration beyond normal engine deterioration, although this
area needs more research. For further discussion of these issues see ``V.P. Applicability of In-Use Standards''
and ``V.Q. In-Use Testing Requirements.'' 

The proposed in-use testing requirement is intended to parallel in-use testing previously or currently conducted
by industry. While manufacturers and their associations have proposed that EPA adopt a cooperative testing program,
EPA believes cooperative programs would not adequately or as effectively achieve the goals of this in-use program.
See ``V.Q. In-Use Testing Requirements.'' 

EPA is proposing that engine manufacturers test a sample of in-use engines. In the absence of in-use emission standards,
EPA believes this testing requirement would be invaluable for manufacturers and EPA to learn about in-use emissions
and emission deterioration. Although EPA would not enforce in-use emission standards for Phase 1 engines, EPA expects
that 
manufacturers would take appropriate actions to prevent recurrence of in-use noncompliance and to also remedy in-use
noncompliance when it was discovered. 

At the time of certification the engine manufacturer would propose which engine families are to be included in the
in-use test program. The certificate of conformity issued by EPA for engine families included in the in-use testing
program would be conditional based on completion of the test program for that 
family. EPA would approve a manufacturer's test program if the selected engine families represented an adequate
consideration of the elements discussed below. 



Number of engines to be tested:

 The number of small SI engines to be tested by a manufacturer would be determined by the following method: 

For an engine manufacturer with total projected annual production of more than 75,000 small SI engines, the minimum
number of engines to be tested will be the lowest of the numbers determined in (1), (2), or (3) below: 

(1) Divide the manufacturer's total projected annual production of small SI engines by 50,000, and round to the nearest
whole number, 

(2) Test five engines each from 25 percent of all small SI engine families certified in that model year, 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00093 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Test three engines each from 50 percent of all small SI engine families certified in that model year. 

An engine manufacturer with total projected annual production of 75,000 small SI engines or less must test a minimum
of two engines. 



Criteria for selecting test engines:

 An engine manufacturer would be required to select test engines from engine families utilizing the following criteria
and in the order specified: 

(1) Engine families using emission technology which may be used on phase 2 engines, 
(2) Engine families using aftertreatment, 
(3) Engine families certified to different emission standards, 
(4) Different engine designs (such as side valve versus overhead valve engines), 
(5) Engine families using emission control technology specifically installed to achieve compliance with Phase
1 standards, 
(6) The engine family with the highest projected annual sales, and 
(7) Engine families which meet the above criteria, but have not been included in prior model year in-use testing programs
as required by these provisions. 



Collection and testing of in-use engines:

 An engine manufacturer would be required to procure in-use engines which have been operated for between half and three-quarters
of the engine's advertised (or projected) useful life. All testing would be completed within three years after the
certificate is issued or is effective, whichever is later, for an engine family which requires in-use testing. 

A test engine would be procured from sources not associated with the engine manufacturer or equipment manufacturer,
except that, with prior approval of the Administrator, an engine manufacturer with annual sales of less than 50,000
engines might obtain in-use engines associated with itself or its equipment manufacturer. 

A test engine would be required to have a maintenance history representative of actual in-use conditions. To comply
with this requirement a manufacturer would question the end user regarding the accumulated usage, maintenance,
operating conditions, and storage of the test engine. 

The manufacturer would perform minimal set-to-spec maintenance on a test engine. Maintenance would include only
what is listed in the owner's instructions for engines with the amount of service and age of the acquired test engine.
One valid emission test would be required for each in-use engine. Finally, if a selected in-use engine failed to comply
with any applicable 
certification emission standards, the manufacturer would be responsible for determining the reason for noncompliance.




In-use test program reporting requirements:

 The manufacturer would be required to submit to the Administrator by January 30 of each calendar year all emission
testing results generated from the in-use testing program. At the 
Administrator's request, a manufacturer would be required to provide documents used in the procurement process,
including criteria used in the procurement screening process and information from the end user(s) related to use,
maintenance, and storage of the selected engines. 

EPA is aware that engine manufacturers may have near-term concerns regarding testing capacity and the burden this
type of program may impose on a newly regulated industry. EPA requests comments on the lack of in-use standards, the
lack of in-use enforcement, all elements of this proposed testing requirement, and on possible alternative designs
of in-use testing programs (such as a joint program between manufacturers and EPA) or enforcement that may be more
effective, giving consideration to the limited lead time and duration of the Phase 1 program. 



11. Certificate of Conformity, Requirements of Certification 



Any manufacturer of a small SI engine would be responsible for obtaining from the Administrator a certificate of conformity
covering any engine introduced into commerce in the United States, before such an engine is sold, offered for sale,
introduced or delivered for introduction into commerce, or 
imported into the United States. 

Section 203 of the CAA does not prohibit the production of vehicles or engines before a certificate of conformity is
issued. Vehicles or engines produced prior to the effective date of a certificate of conformity might also be covered
by the certificate if the following conditions were met: 

 The engine conformed in all respects to the engines described in the application for the certificate of conformity.

 The vehicles or engines were not sold, offered for sale, introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction
into commerce prior to the effective date of the certificate of conformity. 
 The Agency was notified prior to the beginning of production when such production would start, and the Agency
was provided full opportunity to inspect and/or test the engines during and after their production. For example,
the Agency would have the opportunity to conduct SEA production line testing as if the engines had been produced after
the effective date of the 
certificate. 

EPA is proposing that a number of requirements be met by the engine manufacturer prior to granting a certificate of
conformity. As is the case for on-highway vehicles and engines, the proposed regulations would make it illegal for
any person to use a device on a nonroad engine which senses operation outside normal emission test conditions and reduces
the ability of the emission control system to control the engine's emissions. To guard against use of these devices,
EPA would reserve the right to require testing of a certification test engine over a modified test procedure if EPA
suspected a defeat device was being used by an engine manufacturer on a particular engine. In addition, use of defeat
devices would be considered a prohibited act subject to civil penalties.

<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00094 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Engines equipped with adjustable operating parameters would have to comply with all the regulations with the parameters
adjusted to any setting in the full range of adjustment. For example, this could include adjustment of the high-speed
needle for alteration of the air/fuel ratio or adjustment of the speed set screw. This would ensure that changes to
the adjustable operating parameters that might readily occur in use would not cause the engine to fail to comply with
these regulations.
 

EPA is proposing to require that manufacturers label each engine and that the label meet the same requirements with
respect to durability and visibility as required in the current on-highway program. The engine manufacturer would
be responsible for proper labeling of engines from each engine family. In addition, EPA is proposing labeling requirements
for vehicle and equipment manufacturers if the engine label is obscured.
 

EPA is also proposing that each engine must have a unique
 engine identification number which may be part of the engine
 label or engraved on the engine. Such identification is
 necessary for tracking individual engines. Use of engine
 identification numbers would facilitate setting up a tracking
 system and allow manufacturers to sample in-use engines for their
 programs. This identification would be essential for development
 of a long-term in-use durability program. EPA requests comment
 on the labeling proposal as well as on current engine
 identification practices within the industry.
 

Finally, EPA also proposes to require that all engine
 crankcases must be closed to preclude the emissions that occur
 when a crankcase is vented to the atmosphere. Since most
 currently produced engines do have closed crankcases, EPA
 believes this requirement would impact relatively few
 manufacturers. Finally, small SI engine noise levels would not
 be allowed to increase as a result of this rule.
 


EPA requests comment on these proposed certification
 requirements. While EPA is today proposing vehicle and equipment
 manufacturer labeling responsibilities, EPA is considering
 whether to instead make engine manufacturers responsible for
 ensuring that the emission control label is visible once the
 certified engine is incorporated into a given piece of nonroad
 equipment. EPA requests comment on this specific issue as well.
 




12. Vehicle/Equipment Manufacturer Requirements
 



Commencing on this rule's effective date, manufacturers of
 small SI vehicles and equipment and importers would be prohibited
 from introducing into U.S. commerce any vehicle or equipment
 powered by a small SI engine which does not incorporate the
 appropriate certified handheld or nonhandheld engine. Failure to
 do so would make the equipment manufacturer liable for the
 assessment of civil penalties. EPA is proposing this requirement
 because it is concerned that engines certified to meet handheld
 engine standards may in fact be used in nonhandheld equipment.
 This would significantly and negatively impact air quality
 benefits which are to accrue as a result of this rule. Due to
 the potential for engines in different categories to be
 substituted for one another, this prohibition would ensure that
 the regulated engines are used in appropriate applications.
 


As noted above, EPA is proposing to require that the
 original emission control engine label is visible once the
 certified engine is placed in the vehicle or equipment. If the
 engine label is obscured as a result of the vehicle or equipment
 manufacturer's placement of the engine in the nonroad vehicle or
 equipment, the vehicle or equipment manufacturer would be
 required to attach an identical but supplemental label, in a
 readily visible location on a part necessary for normal vehicle
 or equipment operation before it is introduced into United States
 commerce.
 

Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad
 equipment manufacturers to use certified nonroad engines. For
 further discussion, see ``V.F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle
 Definitions.''
 



13. Certification Procedures_Application Process
 




The engine manufacturer would be required to submit an
 application to EPA requesting a certificate of conformity for
 each engine family for every model or calendar year.
 Certificates would be issued to cover production for a single
 model year. See ``V. W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity,
 Definition of Model Year, Annual Production Period'' for further
 discussion of these issues. An application for a certificate
 would be submitted every model year even when the engine family
 does not change from the previous certificate, although
 representative test data could be reused in the succeeding model
 year's application. If the emissions from the test engine were
 below the applicable standards and EPA believed that all other
 requirements of the regulation were met, EPA would issue a
 certificate of conformity for that engine family.
 


The application would need to provide EPA with sufficient
 information to determine the appropriate test results and
 emission characteristics of the engine family. It would also
 allow EPA to determine test engine compliance with the applicable
 emission standards in a timely manner. It would be important that
 the engine manufacturer succinctly, fully, and accurately submit
 all pertinent information to EPA and maintain internal records
 which could be easily accessed if such access is determined to be
 necessary by EPA.

If changes to an engine family configuration occur after the application is submitted which cause the changed version
to be the engine family's worst case emitter, then emission testing of the changed version is required. Additionally,
the Administrator may require a manufacturer to conduct testing to demonstrate compliance. 

The application would be submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Certification Division,
Office of Mobile Sources, 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105. A second copy of the application would be forwarded
to Manufacturers Operation Division, Office of Mobile Sources, 401 M St., SW (Mail Code 6405J), Washington, DC 20460.
The application would include the following information:

 A description of the basic engine design including engine family specifications,

 A complete description and explanation of how the emission control system operates, including a detailed
description of all emission control components, and a listing of the engine and emission control calibrations,

 Part numbers for all emission control components which might reasonably be expected to affect emissions,

 Proposed test engine selection and the rationale for such a selection,

 A description of the test engine starting instructions, fuel, and lubricants to be used,

 A description of the operating cycle and the service accumulation period necessary to break in the test engine,

 A description of all adjustable operating parameters,

 Information relating why the physical limits or stops used to establish the physically adjustable range of
each parameter were effective,

 A description of the rated speed(s) and power(s) within the engine family,

 Fuel flow rates for each configuration within the engine family,

 The proposed maintenance instructions, the emission warranty, and emission control label,

 All test data obtained by the manufacturer on the test engine,

 A description of the test facilities, test equipment, and test procedures,

 A section which incorporated any revisions or amendments to the application, including any production changes,

 A list of official manufacturer contacts, organizational chart, and individual designated to receive the
certificate of conformity,

 The projected annual sales for the engine family,

 A statement indicating which information in the application was confidential, and

 An unconditional statement certifying that all engines in the engine family complied with all the requirements
of the Clean Air Act and this regulation. 




14. Certification Procedures_Testing Overview and Preliminaries 




EPA is proposing that the emission level used to certify an engine family be equal to the highest emission test level
reported for any engine configuration in that family. The engine manufacturer would be responsible for selecting
and testing one engine from each engine family which is most likely to be that engine family's worst case emitter. The
criterion for selecting the worst case engine would be that engine configuration which has the highest weighted brake-specific
fuel consumption over the appropriate engine test cycle. EPA could verify the test results by requiring Administrator
testing of this engine. EPA would also have the option to test any available test engine representing other configurations
in the engine family. 

Before emission testing was carried out, the manufacturer would perform service accumulation on each test engine
over the dynamometer hour accumulation cycle of its choice based on good engineering practices (for example, a cycle
representative of typical ``break-in'' operation of a new production engine in actual use). For each engine family,
the manufacturer would determine the number of hours required to stabilize the emissions of the test engine. However,
the number of hours which the manufacturer chose could not exceed 12 hours. EPA does not believe a break-in time greater
that 12 hours is necessary to stabilize new engine emissions. In addition, this cutoff is necessary to ensure that
EPA gets an equitable view of stabilized emissions over all engine families which may vary with respect to HC and CO
emission degradation and NO

X

 emission improvement with time. The manufacturer would maintain, and provide in its application to the Administrator,
a record of the rationale used both in making the dynamometer cycle selection and in making the service accumulation
hours determination.

The manufacturer would be required to conduct emission tests of selected engine(s) using the proposed test procedure
discussed herein. Finally, the proposed rule does provide for Administrator approval of special test procedures
if the small SI engine is not capable of being satisfactorily tested under the proposed test procedures. 



15. Certification Procedures_Emission Test Procedure for HC, CO, and NO

X

 



EPA is proposing a single test procedure with three different test cycles for measuring HC, CO, and NO

x

. One cycle would be for all Class III, IV, and V engines (Cycle C), while two cycles would be possible for Class I and II
engines (Cycles A and B). 

Cycle B would only be used for those Class I and II engine families in which 100 percent of the engines were sold with a
governor which maintained engine speed within 

#

 two percent of rated speed (rated speed means the speed at which the manufacturer specifies the maximum rated power
of an engine) under all operating conditions. Cycle B would be a 6-mode steady state cycle consisting of five power
modes at rated speed and one no-load mode at idle speed. For all other Class I and II engines, the test cycle to be used
would be Cycle A. Cycle A would be identical to Cycle B, except the five power modes would be run at intermediate engine
speed (intermediate speed is defined as 85 percent of rated speed). 

For Class III, IV, and V engines, the engine manufacturer would be required to use Cycle C. Cycle C is a 2-mode steady
state cycle consisting of one power mode (at rated speed) and one no-load mode at idle speed. The test modes for each
cycle would be run in a prescribed order. 

The three test cycles (modes and power settings) documented in the proposed regulations are based on work performed
by the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE) Small Engine Committee. The SAE Small Engine Committee has published
a recommended practice for measuring gaseous exhaust emissions from small utility engines typically less than 20
kW. This recommended procedure is known as SAE J1088. Test Cycles A, B, and C are all taken from J1088. The mode weighting
factors are taken from work performed by CARB. 

In addition, the International Standards Organization (ISO) has published recommended test cycles for measuring
exhaust emissions from reciprocating internal combustion engines. Recommended exhaust gas measurement procedures
and test cycles for reciprocating internal combustion engines are contained in ISO 8178, Part 4. ISO has three test
cycles for spark-ignition engines less than 20 kW termed G1, G2, and G3 which are identical to SAE Cycles A, B, and C,
respectively. 

EPA believes the proposed test procedures are adequate for the proposed emission standards. The purpose of a certification
test procedure is to adequately represent the emission levels produced by the test engine when it is used in actual
operation. The test procedure in this proposed rule does this. The 6-mode test cycles (Cycle A and Cycle B) used for
Class I and II engines and the 2-mode cycle (Cycle C) used for Class III, IV, and V engines were developed by the Society
of Automotive Engineer's Small Engine Committee to cover the broad range of engine operating conditions seen by small
engines. The weighting factors were developed by CARB using data supplied by the small engine industry. The weighting
factors are intended to be representative of the modes (speed and power conditions) used by the broad range of small
gasoline engines. The Agency believes these weighting factors are sufficient for this proposed rule. 

The methods used to measure the gaseous emissions of HC, CO, and NO

X

 for all small engines would be independent of the type of engine and test cycle. EPA proposes to allow manufacturers
to sample emissions using either the Raw Gas Method (raw) or the Constant Volume Sampling Method (CVS). Using either
method, each test engine would be stabilized at each mode before emission measurement began. After stabilizing the
power output during each mode, the concentration of each pollutant, exhaust volume, and fuel flow would be determined.
The measured values would be weighted and then used to calculate the grams of exhaust pollutant emitted per kilowatt-hour.


SAE J1088 contains a recommended procedure for the measurement of gaseous emissions using the Raw Gas Method. A recommended
testing procedure, such as SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, by definition allows sufficient flexibility for individual manufacturers
to develop unique features in their test procedures while still being within the allowable guidance. This flexibility
is not a desirable feature in a regulatory program where both manufacturers and EPA want to ensure uniformity between
test labs, since conformity and compliance testing decisions are binding on the parties involved. For this reason,
the test procedures proposed by EPA are not identical to SAE J1088 or ISO 8178, but are compatible with those procedures.


EPA understands the importance of compatibility between the EPA proposed test procedures and those used to demonstrate
emission compliance for other regulatory agencies within the U.S. and throughout the world. Compatibility allows
a manufacturer to exercise the cost efficiencies of using one engine configuration to demonstrate emission compliance
in more than one market. EPA has tried to establish a test procedure that is compatible with both CARB's utility engine
test procedure and with ISO 8178. As a result, EPA expects that a manufacturer using the resultant EPA procedure would
also meet the CARB and ISO requirements. However, since the SAE and ISO procedures are recommended practices and do
not have stringent test parameter tolerances, a manufacturer using the SAE or ISO procedure may or may not meet EPA
requirements.

16. Administrator Testing 



EPA is proposing Administrator testing provisions that allow EPA flexibility in determining when and where engine
testing may occur. This is necessary given EPA's limited testing facilities. 

Specifically, this provision would allow EPA to require test engine testing at any given location, including at a
manufacturer's facility. The Administrator would be empowered to require the manufacturer to make available such
instrumentation and equipment that was specified by the Administrator. Any testing conducted at a manufacturer's
facility would be scheduled by the manufacturer as promptly as possible. Authorized EPA personnel would be given
access to the facilities to observe such testing. 



17. Catalyst Durability 



EPA expects the emission controls used to meet the exhaust emission standards specified in this rulemaking to be durable
so that emission reduction benefits are realized not only when the engines are new, but also during operation in-use,
over time. Although EPA is not proposing full emission control system durability demonstration requirements in
this notice, manufacturers are fully expected to design such systems to be effective under normal in-use operating
conditions over time. Full emission control system durability demonstration requirements are expected to be included
in the Phase 2 regulations for small SI engines. However, EPA has concerns that certain emission control components,
namely catalysts, warrant separate consideration. Therefore, EPA is proposing durability demonstration requirements
for catalysts in this notice as discussed in greater detail in ``V. U. Catalyst Durability.'' 



18. Information Requirements, Application for Certificate of Conformity, Amendments 



This rule's information retention requirements are similar to those proposed in the nonroad large CI rule. EPA believes
that the proposed information requirements are sufficient to adequately determine compliance with this regulation
and the appropriateness of awarding a certificate of conformity. 


A manufacturer would be responsible for retaining certain information applicable to each test engine along with
copies of the submitted applications for individual certificates of conformity. A manufacturer would also be required
to submit an amendment(s) to the application or certificate of conformity whenever additional small SI engines were
added to an engine family or changes were made to a product line covered by a certificate of conformity. Notification
normally would occur prior to either producing such engines or making such changes to a product line. 



19. Selective Enforcement Auditing Program 



EPA is proposing to conduct a Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA) program of small SI engines as authorized by section
213 of the CAA. The small engine SEA program would be an emission compliance program for new production small SI engines
in which manufacturers would be required to test engines as they leave the assembly line, with EPA oversight. Through
SEA testing, EPA could determine with reasonable statistical certainty whether or not tested engine families were
in compliance with the Act. 

EPA believes that an SEA program is necessary to verify that production engines comply with applicable regulations.
Since certification would be based on preproduction prototype engines which often contain specially built and installed
components, production engines could still fail to meet emission standards if quality control was inadequate. SEAs
would provide a means to test actual production engines as they came off the assembly line. Since no in-use enforcement
program is being proposed for small SI engines, SEA provides the only opportunity for EPA to determine the compliance
of production engines. 

EPA would assign a limit to the number of SEAs each manufacturer could receive during a model year. As in the on-highway
SEA program, this annual limit would be used to provide assurance to manufacturers that EPA would not significantly
overburden a manufacturer with an unreasonable number of audits during the model year. 

Each SEA would be an audit of one engine family, and each passing audit would count toward the manufacturer's annual
limit. EPA is proposing an annual limit of two for each manufacturer with projected annual production of less than
100,000 engines. For manufacturers with annual production of 100,000 or more engines the annual limit would be the
greater of either two or the number determined by dividing the number of engine families certified in that model year
by five, and rounding to the nearest whole number. For example, a manufacturer with a projected annual United States
production of 600,000 engines with 13 certified engine families would have an annual limit of three, and a manufacturer
with a projected annual production of 300,000 small SI engines and 22 engine families would have an annual limit of
four.

EPA believes this method of determining annual limits is 
most appropriate for the small SI engine industry. EPA is 
proposing the minimum annual limit of two because manufacturers 
may change production during the model year. If a manufacturer 
passed an SEA early in a model year, the manufacturer might 
subsequently implement changes in its production process which 
could increase engine emissions. With an annual limit of two, 
EPA would have the flexibility to audit a manufacturer early in 
the model year, and then return later in the model year if that 
manufacturer implemented a change in production which could 
increase engine emissions. 


As described above, EPA is also proposing that manufacturers 
with projected annual production of 100,000 small SI engines or 
more may have an annual limit of more than two. EPA believes it 
might be necessary to conduct more than two SEAs on larger engine 
manufacturers when they have a large variety of engine families. 
When manufacturers have a variety of engine families, an SEA 
might only check a small portion of the manufacturers' 
production. Therefore, by dividing the number of engine families 
certified by larger manufacturers by five, EPA could establish a 
higher annual limit for those manufacturers with a variety of 
engine families with different emission characteristics. 
Manufacturers with lower production should be assured that EPA 
would not overburden its limited test facilities with SEAs. 


Annual limits would act as a cap and would not necessarily 
be the actual number of audits a manufacturer received. EPA 
would not exceed a manufacturer's annual limit unless the Agency 
had reason to believe noncompliance was occurring. EPA requests 
comment on the proposed method for determining annual limits. The 
SEA program strives to encourage manufacturers to perform self-
auditing and promptly remedy the emission noncompliance it 
discovers. Therefore, EPA would consider reducing the number of 
audits conducted by the Agency, minimizing audits of engine 
families which are unusually burdensome to audit, or both 
options, if the manufacturer provided substantial data to 
demonstrate conformity of actual production engines with the 
applicable emission standards. EPA suggests that manufacturers 
unfamiliar with self-auditing review existing on-highway 
programs, such as CARB's Quality Audit Program or the 
manufacturers' Assembly Line Test Data, for guidance in 
implementing an in-house auditing program. Examples of audit 
programs are available in the docket for this rulemaking. 


EPA would review self-audit data and procedures used in 
acquiring the data to assess the validity and representativeness 
of each manufacturer's self-audit program. The primary criteria 
EPA would use in evaluating the in-house programs are sample 
size, randomness within the family of the audited engine(s), 
frequency of testing, and the applicable required test 
procedures. EPA would discount the value of any self-audit data 
if the Agency received indications of noncompliance or concluded 
that the data were invalid, incomplete, unrepresentative, or 
insufficient. In addition, manufacturers with a comprehensive 
self-audit program would be subject to spot checks with EPA 
oversight to provide EPA assurance of compliance. EPA requests 
comment on this issue. 


Manufacturers would be notified of an SEA by means of a test 
order. This test order would specify the engine family to be 
audited. EPA might also specify an engine configuration or range 
of configurations from a family to be audited. However, EPA 
would reserve the option to select all configurations within an 
engine family for an SEA. To minimize the burden on 
manufacturers, EPA would consider requests by manufacturers to 
exclude particular engines or engine configurations from a test 
sample. Justification for such requests could be to avoid a 
delay in shipment of urgent customer-ordered engines or to 
minimize test cell set-up time by selecting engines of similar 
physical configurations. 


Test orders would include information relevant to the SEA. 
The test order would indicate any specific procedures, such as 
the time to begin selecting engines, during the course of the 
audit. Additionally, the test order would authorize EPA 
enforcement officers, upon presentation of enforcement 
credentials, to inspect engine production, test facilities, 
storage facilities, and records necessary to establish compliance 
with nonroad regulations. 


Due to differences between the small SI industry and the on-
highway industry, EPA is proposing that some aspects of the on-
highway SEA program be modified for small SI engines. 
Historically, on-highway engine SEAs have been conducted on 
engine configurations: a specific engine family, an engine code, 
a rated speed and an emission control system. EPA believes that 
making an entire small engine family subject to an audit would 
lead manufacturers to use extra care when grouping engines in a 
family. Consequently, EPA is proposing that nonroad SEAs be 
conducted by sampling engines from within an engine family. EPA 
requests comments on this aspect of the program. 



SEA engines would typically be selected from a point of 
final engine assembly or from a storage or shipping facility. 
Most often, this selection point would be at the end of the 
engine assembly line, where no further quality control procedures 
happen or parts would be installed on the engines. Selection of 
imported engines could occur at a port of entry. SEA engines 
could not receive any additional inspections or quality control 
other than that of normal production engines and pre-test safety 
checks. Engines would be tested in the same order as they were 
selected. EPA requests comment on the feasibility of selecting 
equipment, then removing the engine for audit testing. 


EPA proposes to include ports of entry or storage locations 
in the United States as locations for EPA selection of foreign- 
produced small SI engines for SEA emission testing at 
laboratories in the United States. The location of these 
selections could be designated by the manufacturer to minimize 
disruption and shipping costs. The manufacturer would be 
responsible for ensuring that a test facility in the United 
States was available for SEA testing.

``Port selection'' would assist the Agency in reducing its travel costs. Recently, in the on-highway program, EPA
has had requests from light-duty vehicle manufacturers to conduct port selection during SEAs. These audits were
performed and ran smoothly. EPA might permit reasonable maintenance and inspections of port-selected engines to
address problems that could result from long-term storage, ocean shipping, or repeated handling. EPA requests comments
on the port selection aspect of the SEA program. 

Prior to testing SEA engines, manufacturers could operate engines to break in engine components. This break-in or
service accumulation of an SEA engine family would follow the same procedures and could be up to 12 hours or the same
number of break-in hours accumulated for that family's emission data engine during certification. Service accumulation
would be performed expeditiously and in a manner using good engineering judgment. 

Audit engines would be tested using the same test cycle, either Test Cycle A, B, or C, as was used in certification; however,
deviations allowed in certification from the full test procedures as described in proposed 40 CFR part 90 would not
be permitted in SEAs. 

EPA is proposing that small SI engines will be selected for SEA testing at a rate of at least four engines per day, unless
production is less than four engines per day. To minimize delays in shipment of engines to customers, manufacturers
could test the first engines selected for an audit while additional engines were produced. 

The total number of engines tested in an SEA would be dictated by the number of engines required to reach the statistically
acceptable pass/fail decision within the sampling plan applied. EPA is proposing a sequential sampling plan for
small SI engine SEAs. These sampling plans have been designed to meet a 40 percent Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) and
to ensure low statistical risks of incorrect pass/fail determinations. The maximum theoretical percentage of failing
engines for passing an SEA is 40 percent. EPA is proposing a 40 percent AQL for the small SI engine SEA program. EPA has
used this AQL since the 1970s for the on-highway program, and EPA currently has no reason to propose a different AQL
for a nonroad program. EPA is proposing that the small SI engine SEA program use the same sampling plans used for the
on-highway heavy-duty engine SEA program. 

EPA proposes that engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales of 7,500 or greater must complete
a minimum of two engine tests per day during an SEA. Engine manufacturers with projected United States annual sales
of less than 7,500 would be required to complete a minimum of one engine test per day during an SEA. A valid emission test
or a voided test would each count as one test toward meeting the requirement. EPA requests comments on this aspect of
the proposal. 

A test engine's pass or fail determination would be made by comparing final test results to the applicable federal
emission standard. Within five working days of the conclusion of an audit, manufacturers would be required to submit
a report to EPA summarizing engine test results, test procedures, and audit events such as the date, time, and location
of each test, repairs to engines, and the reason for the repair. 

Failure of an SEA could result in suspension or revocation of the certificate of conformity for that family. To have
the certificate reinstated subsequent to a suspension, or reissued subsequent to a revocation, the manufacturer
would be required to demonstrate, by showing passing data, that improvements, modifications, or replacement had
brought the family into compliance. The proposed regulations include hearing provisions which allow the manufacturer
to challenge EPA's suspension or revocation decision based on application of the sampling plans or the manner in which
tests were conducted. 



20. Importation of Nonconforming Small SI Engines 



EPA is proposing certain restrictions on the importation of nonconforming small SI engines. Such restrictions are
based in part on the existing regulations for the importation of nonconforming motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines.


While EPA provides for an Independent Commercial Importer (ICI) program for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines,
EPA is not certain that an ICI program is necessary or practical for small SI engines. For the on-highway program, ICIs
are responsible for all aspects of compliance required of manufacturers (e.g., certification, testing, labeling,
warranty, recall, maintaining records). EPA solicits comment on the need for an ICI program for small SI engines.
Due to the uncertainty about the need for an ICI program, EPA is proposing in the alternative both to have an ICI program
that parallels that of the on-highway program, and to have no ICI program in the final rule. EPA currently favors no
ICI program for small SI engines; if the Agency determines not to promulgate an ICI program, the proposed regulatory
language will be deleted from the final rule. 

This proposal includes a special provision for individuals to import a limited number of nonconforming small SI engines
for personal use. EPA expects that individuals may not know of the regulations applicable to small SI engines and,
without this once in a lifetime exemption, individuals may be stopped at a port of entry with small SI engines and equipment
included with their personal possessions. Additionally, this exemption would relieve a significant burden on EPA
and the U.S. Customs Service. EPA is proposing that, at least for Phase 1 of these regulations, individuals be permitted
to import up to three nonconforming small SI engines and not have these engines brought into compliance with the proposed
standards. This is a one-time exemption (for one importation) in which individuals are permitted to import these
engines for personal use and not for purposes of resale. This exemption would not require prior EPA written approval.
Additional small SI engines, after an individual's limit of three, would not be permitted to be imported under the
proposal unless otherwise provided under another exemption or exclusion. All small SI engines imported for purposes
of resale would be required to be imported and modified by an ICI. If EPA does not finalize an ICI program, such engines
may not be imported for resale. EPA requests comment on this proposed exemption.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Today's proposal also provides certain exemptions to the restrictions on importing nonconforming small SI engines.
These include exemptions for repairs and alterations, testing, precertification, display, national security,
hardship, small SI engines greater than 20 original production years old, and certain small SI engines proven to be
identical, in all material respects, to their corresponding United States certified versions. These exemptions
would also include the exclusion of nonconforming engines used solely in competition. 

EPA is not proposing to include provisions for a catalyst control program for small SI engines. The catalyst control
program for motor vehicles consists of a special provision for catalyst-equipped vehicles to be operated in countries
where the catalyst may be poisoned by the use of leaded fuel. In the on-highway catalyst control program, owners may
either have the catalyst removed while the vehicle is operated outside of the United States or, if the vehicle is driven
only in countries that have a wide availability of unleaded gasoline, demonstrate by using a plumbtesmo test that
the vehicle was not operated on leaded fuel. EPA is not proposing a catalyst control program for small SI engines because
EPA does not expect that U.S. certified small SI engines equipped with catalysts will be used in countries that do not
have a wide availability of unleaded fuel and then imported into the United States. Additionally, EPA has no knowledge
of the extent to which catalysts will be used on Phase 1 small SI engines. EPA requests comments on the absence of a catalyst
control program and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines. 

Finally, EPA is not proposing to include a provision for small SI engine Designated Canadian Importer (DCI). EPA's
motor vehicle import program has a special provision in which DCIs may import and sell Canadian vehicles that were
manufactured to be identical in all material respects to U.S. certified counterparts. Because EPA has no indication
that Canada will adopt EPA's Phase 1 small SI engine standards, engines imported from Canada into the United States
will likely be nonconforming engines and thus would not be eligible to be imported by a small SI engine DCI. Consequently,
EPA expects that provisions for small SI engine DCI are unnecessary. EPA requests comment on the absence of a DCI program
and the need for such a program for Phase 1 engines. 

Importation regulations are joint regulations between EPA and the United States Department of the Treasury (Customs
Service). The citation for United States Customs Service, Department of Treasury regulations governing import
requirements is reserved. The citation will be inserted upon promulgation by the United States Customs Service of
the applicable regulations. 



21. Defect Reporting and Voluntary Recall 



EPA is proposing that a manufacturer of small SI engines file a defect information report whenever a manufacturer
identifies the existence of a specific emission-related defect in 25 or more engines in a single engine family manufactured
in the same model year. However, no report would need to be filed if the defect was corrected prior to the sale of the affected
engines to the ultimate purchaser. These proposed reporting requirements are similar to the requirements found
in the on-highway program. EPA is currently revising the on-highway reporting program and new regulations will shortly
be proposed. The new regulations may encompass both on-highway and the nonroad sector. 

EPA is also proposing that individual manufacturers establish, when appropriate, voluntary recall programs. EPA
is proposing limited guidelines which engine manufacturers would follow when undertaking such a program. EPA invites
comments on how such a voluntary program might be effectively structured. 



22. Emission Defect Warranty Requirements 



EPA is proposing that engine manufacturers provide an emission warranty for the first two years of engine use. The
two-year warranty period was adopted from California's lawn and garden regulations to reduce the burden on manufacturers
of administering two different warranty programs.

<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA is also considering ``hours of engine use'' as an alternative measure for the warranty period. Under this option,
an engine manufacturer would need to install some form of metering device to track the hours of use for an engine. EPA
solicits comments on this metering option, the feasibility of outfitting small engines with such devices, and the
feasibility of employing the useful life hours generated in the Nonroad Study as a measure for an hours-based warranty
period. 

EPA believes that a warranty program is necessary to ensure the quality of emission control components and systems
that are used on or in nonroad engines and also to protect consumers from costly repairs that result from manufacturing
defects. Furthermore, a warranty program gives the engine owner/operator the incentive to get emission-related
system failures repaired, since failures to the emission control system do not always affect the ability of an engine
to work. 

The warranty requirements proposed today are consistent with emission defect warranty policies developed for on-highway
vehicles, located in section 207(a) of the Act. Manufacturers of new nonroad engines would warrant to the ultimate
purchaser and each subsequent purchaser that such engine was (1) designed, built, and equipped so as to conform at
the time of sale with applicable regulations under section 213 of the Act, and (2) free from defects in materials and
workmanship which cause such engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its warranty period. The related
parts and components covered by section 207(a) are detailed in an advisory parts list issued by EPA on July 15, 1991,
and encompass parts and systems which are or may be used on small SI engines. A copy of the parts list is in the public docket
for this rulemaking. EPA invites comments on this parts list and its applicability to small SI engines. 

EPA is currently developing more detailed regulations that will further clarify manufacturers' responsibilities
under section 207(a) for both on-highway and nonroad engines. EPA will rely on the existing 207(a) practices until
those regulations are finalized. 



23. Tampering Enforcement 



Today's action would make it illegal for any person to tamper with any emission-related component or system installed
on or in a small SI engine. EPA believes that an engine would more likely continue to meet the applicable emissions standards
in-use if the engine maintained its certified configuration. Therefore, EPA believes it is necessary to impose antitampering
provisions for such engines and is proposing that the existing policies developed for on-highway tampering also
apply to engines included in this rule. See Office of Enforcement and General Counsel; Mobile Source Enforcement
Memorandum No. 1A, June 25, 1974. A copy of this memorandum is in the public docket for this rulemaking. 



V. Discussion of Issues 


This section contains further discussion of a number of issues raised during the development of this proposal. 





A. Use of Metric Units

 



Metric units are used throughout the proposed rule without English equivalents. This is done in compliance with the
Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended, and Executive Order 12770, July 25, 1981, which directs all federal agencies
to use metric as the primary unit in regulations by September 30, 1992 and to only provide English equivalents when
the affected party(s) uses English as the primary unit. 

EPA acknowledges slight differences between the two systems and the use of mixed units by CARB. Comments are solicited
on the impact of using only metric units or the need for including the English equivalent. 





B. Use of Power Rating as Cutoff for Applicability 



EPA is proposing to limit the applicability of this action to engines at or below 19 kW (25 horsepower) rated power as
compared to CARB's 25 horsepower limit. EPA considered limiting the regulation's applicability based instead on
a total displacement, but has chosen to propose a power-based cutoff for 
consistency with CARB. 

EPA is aware that the measurement of rated power is subject to engine configuration and test conditions, and that a
cutoff based on power might create an incentive for manufacturers with engines just below the cutoff to change engine
and/or test procedure parameters to result in a higher measured power. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In examining data from Power Systems Research (PSR),
 EPA 
has identified a relationship between total displacement and 
rated power which suggests that a one-liter total displacement 
cutoff would affect nearly an identical group of engines as a 19 
kW cutoff. However, using such a cutoff would cause a limited 
number of engines to be included that would not be included using 
a 19 kW cutoff (that is, engines above 19 kW but less than one 
liter displacement). Examples include larger two-stroke engines. 
A limited number of engines would also go unregulated under this 
scenario (that is, engines under 19 kW but greater than one 
liter). Examples include larger industrial four-stroke engines. 





Because of the differences in applicability between a power- 
and displacement-based cutoff, EPA has chosen to propose the 
former despite the potential advantages of the latter. EPA 
requests comment on the appropriateness of instead limiting this 
regulation to engines under one-liter total displacement (or a 
different displacement limit), or limiting the applicability to 
engines that are below displacement or power cutoffs. Comments 
should address the relative market and environmental impact of 
the alternative approaches, as well as the relative 
enforceability. 



C. Exclusion of Compression-ignition Engines 



EPA is not proposing to regulate small CI engines in this 
action. As part of the 

Sierra Club 

v. 

Browner 

settlement, EPA 
will determine by November 1996 whether to undertake a rulemaking 
which targets emissions from small CI engines. CI engines have 
different emission characteristics from the engines addressed by 
this proposal, emitting much lower levels of HC and considerably 
higher levels of NO

x 

than small SI engines. 

In contrast to the current proposal, which is focused on 
achieving reductions in emissions of HC, a regulation addressing 
CI engines would likely focus on NOx. EPA lacks sufficient data 
regarding baseline emissions and control technologies for nonroad 
CI engines in this power range to determine appropriate standards 
at this time. Therefore EPA has chosen to exclude these engines 
from the current proposal, which is aimed at achieving 
significant reductions in small engine HC emissions on an 
expedited basis. 

EPA is raising this as an issue because of the potential 
that unregulated CI engines could be substituted for post-control 
SI engines. In EPA's view, while this may occur in some cases 
(for example, small agricultural tractors), the most price-sensitive products such as string trimmers and lawnmowers
are 
unlikely to shift significantly toward CI engines due to 
technological limitations, consumer preference, or both. 

The Agency solicits comment on the exclusion of compression-
ignition engines, and on the appropriate test procedure and 
standards that should be applied to CI engines if they were to 
instead be covered by this regulation. 



D. Exclusion of Recreational Propulsion Engines 



EPA is proposing to exclude engines used in recreational 
vehicles, examples of which include snowmobiles, off-road 
motorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles. Golf carts do not qualify 
as recreational vehicles under this proposal, and they would be 
subject to the emission standards of this rule. Engines used in 
such recreational vehicles are defined by the following 
characteristics: Use of a continuously variable throttle (as 
opposed to a governor), rated engine speeds in excess of 5,000 
RPM, and wide variations in both engine load and speed. 

EPA's primary reason for this exclusion is the extremely 
transient operation of the products in which these engines are 
used, which limits the ability of the proposed steady state test 
procedure to adequately represent exhaust emissions. This 
exclusion is not based on a determination that these engines do 
not contribute to air pollution and therefore need not be 
controlled. EPA has chosen to exclude engines used in 
recreational vehicles in order that it may proceed quickly with a 
program for other small SI engines. As part of the 

Sierra Club 


v. 

Browner 

settlement, EPA will determine by November 1996 
whether to undertake a rulemaking which targets emissions from 
engines used in recreational vehicles. 

EPA solicits comment on the exclusion of engines used in 
recreational vehicles, on the criteria used to identify such 
engines, and on the appropriate test procedure and emission 
standards if EPA were to include such engines in this proposal. 



E. Exclusion of Marine Propulsion Engines

<TEXT>
 

EPA proposes to exclude marine propulsion engines, examples 
of which, in this power range, include outboard marine engines. 
EPA is developing emission standards for marine propulsion 
engines in a separate action. However, small SI engines used on 
marine vessels for purposes other than propulsion, such as 
generators and pumps, are not excluded in this proposal. 



F. Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Definitions 



EPA is proposing to incorporate in this rule the nonroad 
engine definition proposed in the large CI rule. EPA will 
include in this rule any changes to that definition included in 
the final large CI rule. EPA is also proposing to amend the 
definition of nonroad vehicle proposed there by adding the 
following sentence: ``Nonroad vehicle also includes equipment 
that is powered by nonroad engines.'' 

The statutory definition of nonroad vehicle adopted by 
Congress in the 1990 CAA Amendments provides little guidance as 
to what is a nonroad vehicle. Rather, statutory language 
describes only what is not a nonroad vehicle, namely, motor 
vehicles and vehicles used solely for competition. A review of 
the Conference Report, the Statement of Senate Managers, and the 
Statement of House Managers does not provide any additional 
guidance. It is necessary to examine both the House and Senate 
Committee Reports of the original legislation before this issue 
is discussed. 

The United States House of Representatives, Committee on 
Energy and Commerce, Report on H.R. 3030, offers some insight 
into the meaning of both nonroad engine and vehicle. In part the 
report states, ``(T)he term `nonroad engine' is defined for 
purposes of this section to include certain internal combustion 
engines not used in a motor vehicle or a competition vehicle, 
while a nonroad vehicle is a vehicle powered by (a) nonroad 
engine that is not a motor vehicle and not used solely for 
competition. Stationary internal combustion engines are to be 
regulated under Title I of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, 
and are not subject to the requirements of this section.''
 





Equally enlightening is the report of S. 1630 from the 
United States Senate, Committee of Environment and Public Works, 
which discusses at some length the Committee's understanding of 
what the terms nonroad engine and nonroad vehicle mean. A 
pertinent part of the report states,




* * * ``non-road engines'' include a wide range of engine uses 
and vehicles. The term includes, for example, diesel 
locomotives, farm and construction equipment, utility 
engines such as lawn and garden equipment, marine vessels, 
forklifts and airport vehicles. The definition in the bill 
for non-road vehicles is an inclusive one that covers all 
engines that are not used in motor vehicles, or in a vehicle 
used solely for competition in vehicle racing, that are not 
regulated by standards promulgated under section 111 of the 
Act, and that are not subject to regulation under part B of 
title I of the Act, related to aircraft.






EPA believes that Congress used the terms ``non-road engine,'' 
``equipment,'' and ``vehicle'' interchangeably. It is EPA's belief 
that Congress intended nonroad vehicles and nonroad engines to 
be inclusive terms covering all manner of equipment not defined 
as motor vehicles, vehicles for competition, and stationary 
sources. Furthermore, there is a practical interrelationship 
between an engine and the equipment that houses it or is powered 
by it. Equipment or vehicle characteristics may have a 
significant impact on the emissions associated with the operation 
of the engine. The nonroad engine definition proposed in the 
large CI rule and incorporated in this rulemaking relies to a 
great extent on this interrelationship between an engine and a 
piece of equipment to determine whether an engine is a nonroad 
engine. In future development of a small SI engine program, it 
may become necessary and appropriate to regulate aspects of 
equipment to control fuel spillage, evaporative emissions, or 
refueling emissions. EPA believes that CAA section 213 provides 
authority for such regulation. 



G. Definition of Handheld Equipment 



EPA is proposing that engines intended for use in equipment 
defined as handheld be certified to standards much less stringent 
than those applicable to engines used in nonhandheld equipment. 
However, on a percentage basis, the reductions obtained from 
handheld and nonhandheld engines will be of similar magnitude. 
Because of the unique characteristics of handheld 2-stroke 
engines, it is not feasible, given the timing of this proposal 
and the unique performance requirements of handheld equipment, to 
require that all engines covered in this proposal meet emission 
levels that can be achieved by 4-stroke engines used in 
nonhandheld equipment. 

This distinction is based, in part, on the substantial 
difference between emissions from current 4-stroke and 2-stroke 
engines, which is an inherent result of the design differences of 
these engines. Because of scavenging losses, current 2-stroke 
engines generally emit approximately ten times more unburned HC 
(on an energy-specific basis) than their 4-stroke counterparts. 

However, current 2-stroke engines are generally lighter 
than current 4-stroke engines of the same rated power and can be 
operated in any orientation. As a result, applications requiring 
that the operator pick up and/or carry the device while using it 
(for example, chain saws), are nearly exclusively powered by 2- 
stroke engines. On the other hand, nonhandheld applications such 
as lawnmowers, which are currently sold in both 2-stroke and 4-stroke versions, can clearly be powered by 4-stroke
engines. 
Approximately 90 percent of the lawnmowers sold in the United 
States are powered by 4-stroke engines. Section VII discusses 
the present market mix of small engines.

EPA is proposing to distinguish between ``handheld'' and 
``nonhandheld'' equipment in a manner that is similar to that 
adopted by CARB. However, EPA proposes to clarify and expand on 
California's handheld definition. 
First, in cases where the operator carries all of the 
equipment's weight during engine operation, the equipment would 
be classified as handheld. Second, where the equipment is 
clearly required to operate in any position the equipment would 
also be classified as handheld. California's handheld definition 
requires that the equipment must both be carried and used 
multipositionally in order to qualify for handheld status. EPA 
requests comment on whether this approach may preclude equipment 
which is in practice ``handheld'' from qualifying for handheld 
status. The proposed federal definition does not require that 
both stated criteria be present for a given piece of equipment to 
qualify as handheld. One criterion is sufficient. It is EPA's 
intent that the preceding two criteria allow leafblowers, 
trimmers (both string and hedge), cutters, or chain saws to 
qualify for handheld status. 
In addition, EPA is proposing that engines be allowed to 
meet Class III, IV, or V standards if the dry weight of the 
equipment they are used in, including engine weight, is under 14 
kg, there are no more than two wheels present on the equipment, 


and

 at least one of the following three attributes is also 
present: (1) The operator alternately provides support or 
carries the equipment throughout its performance; (2) the 
operator provides support and attitudinal control for the 
equipment throughout its performance; (3) the engine is used 
exclusively in a generator or pump. 
EPA believes that a weight-based criterion is an appropriate 
initial determinant of whether a 2-stroke engine can be handheld. 
Industry data show clear weight distinctions between those 
engines which are ``lightweight'' and made for handheld operations 
and those which are not. For example, review of industry 
brochures revealed that 2-stroke engines were almost always found 
in equipment under 14 kg. In addition, the presence of not more 
than two wheels in a given piece of equipment is another 
important indicator of the need for an operator to either 
support, carry, or provide attitudinal control for the equipment. 
The first attribute seeks to classify as ``handheld'' 
equipment which is either carried or supported by the operator 
throughout the entire engine operation. An operator carries 
equipment when the full weight of the equipment is borne by the 
operator. Support means that the operator holds the equipment in 
position so as to prevent it from falling, slipping, or sinking. 
The entire weight of the equipment is not necessarily borne by 
the operator. Legitimate sources of support might include the 
ground, ice, wood, or concrete. EPA intends that lightweight 
snowblowers, edgers, and augers qualify for handheld status under 
this first attribute. 
The second attribute classifies as ``handheld'' equipment 
which requires either operator support or attitudinal control 
during the entire operation. Attitudinal control means the 
operator regulates either the horizontal or vertical position of 
the equipment. This definition is meant to allow certain 
lightweight tillers, augers, or edgers to qualify for handheld 
status. Both ice and earth augers must be carried to each drill 
site by the operator, and must be supported by the operator 
during operation. In addition, the operator must control the 
vertical attitude of the equipment during operation including 
pulling upward after each hole is drilled. Tillers without 
wheels or with no more than two wheels are designed to be 
supported or picked up frequently during operation while 
maneuvering between rows in a garden. Likewise, the vertical and 
horizontal position of the tiller is controlled by the operator. 
Finally, the third attribute acknowledges that engines used 
in lightweight pumps and generators should be allowed to meet the 
handheld emission standards. Like augers, lightweight generators 
and pumps are carried to the work site by the operator and may 
operate at significant distances from electrical-power outlets. 
All other equipment would be classified as nonhandheld 
equipment. Examples of nonhandheld equipment include lawnmowers, 
compressors, lawn tractors, garden tractors, tillers with wheels, 
chippers/grinders, and log splitters. 
EPA believes that the proposed handheld definition 
identifies sufficient criteria by which all handheld equipment 
types may be classified. However, it may still be possible that 
certain equipment types which are in practice handheld 
applications would not meet this definition. EPA is considering 
whether to institute a ``case-by-case review process'' so that, 
where appropriate in the Administrator's judgment, engines used 
in specific types of nonhandheld equipment would either be 
reclassified as handheld or would be allowed to meet the handheld 
emission standards as if that type of equipment was classified as 
handheld. In such cases, the Administrator might consider 
factors including, but not necessarily limited to the following: 
Equipment function and design (for example, handle placement); 
equipment capability; equipment weight; engine weight; rated 
power; multipositional operating requirements; presence and 
number of wheels; presence of other weight supports; availability 
of similar 4-stroke, electric, and/or nonpowered models by the 
same manufacturer or competitors; typical operating profiles 
(including season of use), and nationwide annual industry-wide 
sales. The manufacturer requesting such a review might be 
required to demonstrate, based on these and any other pertinent 
factors, that a 2-stroke engine clearly was a necessary design 
feature of the equipment concerned.

EPA is currently aware of at least one type of equipment 
that, in EPA's view, might need to be evaluated through such a 
process. Unlike CARB, EPA is not allowing all currently produced 
2-stroke snowthrowers to meet standards applicable to engines 
used in handheld equipment. In approving its regulations, 
California accepted arguments that nonhandheld 2-stroke 
snowthrowers should be allowed an exemption from the nonhandheld 
standards to meet emission standards for handheld engines. In 
EPA's view, at least two factors could have formed a basis for 
this decision: First, snowthrowers are operated in the winter, 
which means that they do not significantly impact ozone 
nonattainment and thus need not be subject to stringent control 
aimed at improving ambient air quality; and second, at least some 
of the lightweight 2-stroke snowthrowers that were exempted from 
nonhandheld standards appear to be designed to be picked up while 
in operation (for example, to clear porch steps), implying that 
the use of a 4-stroke engine would significantly limit critical 
performance features. 
While the first of these factors raises questions regarding 
the need to control emissions at all from products that are 
clearly only used in the winter, regardless of their 
classification as handheld or nonhandheld, those questions must 
also be weighed against the need to address CO emissions, and the 
need to protect the health of equipment operators. The second 
factor reveals potential problems with CARB's definition of 
``handheld.'' Specifically, CARB's action with regard to 
snowthrowers raises questions regarding other ``fringe'' products. 
EPA believes that it would be appropriate to classify as 
handheld equipment lightweight snowthrowers under 14 kg which 
have no more than two wheels and which would either be carried or 
supported during operation. All other snowthrowers would be 
classified as nonhandheld and required to meet the standards that 
were generally applicable to engines used in nonhandheld 
equipment. EPA solicits comment on this proposal. 
Under EPA's proposed definitions, lawnmowers will be 
classified as nonhandheld equipment and thus engines used in 
lawnmowers must meet the more stringent nonhandheld emission 
standards. Manufacturers of 2-stroke lawnmower engines have 
raised concerns over their economic survival if required to meet 
nonhandheld standards, based on their doubt that cost-effective 
technology now exists to bring their 2-stroke engines into timely 
compliance. EPA requests comment on the ability of 2-stroke 
lawnmower engine manufacturers to meet the nonhandheld standards, 
the impact such a requirement would have on such manufacturers, 
the need for relief for such manufacturers, and the impact such 
relief might have on the environmental benefits of this proposal. 
EPA further requests comment on the following options for 
providing relief to 2-stroke lawnmower engine manufacturers: (1) 
Provide an extended effective date, such as 1998, for 2-stroke 
lawnmower engines to meet the nonhandheld standards; (2) allow 2- 
stroke lawnmower engines to meet the handheld engine standards 
until the effective date of the second phase of small SI engine 
regulations; (3) cap the number of 2-stroke lawnmowers allowed to 
certify to the handheld standards to the number sold in the year 
this proposal is published or promulgated until the effective 
date of the second phase of small SI engine regulations; or (4) 
allow a declining percentage of 2-stroke lawnmower engines to 
meet the handheld standards, such as 100 percent in 1996, 75 
percent in 1997, 50 percent in 1998, and 25 percent in 1999, so 
that by the year 2000, all 2-stroke lawnmower engines sold would 
meet the nonhandheld emission standards.

EPA solicits comment on the proposed definition of handheld 
equipment and on the potential process for handling those types 
of equipment that may pose difficulties to classification. EPA 
also requests comment on the specific cases discussed. Finally, 
EPA solicits comment on alternative definitions that may be 
appropriate. Alternative definitions of ``handheld equipment'' 
might include, but need not be limited to, the following 
elements:


 Lack of wheels or other means of support (other than 
operator), 
I11 Overall weight below some limit such as 10 kg or 20 kg, and 
 Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine 
above some minimum, such as 75 percent.




Conversely, alternative definitions of ``nonhandheld equipment'' 
could include elements such as:




 Presence of wheels or other means of support other than 
operator, 

 Overall weight above some minimum such as 10 kg or 20 kg, 
and 

 Portion of overall weight attributable to current engine 
below some limit such as 75 percent.


It should be recognized that recent engineering developments 
may eventually obviate the need to provide different standards 
for handheld and nonhandheld equipment engines. Future technical 
solutions may provide engines used in all applications with 
comparable emission performance capability. For example, one 
firm has recently announced plans to begin marketing portable 
string trimmers, traditionally powered by either electricity or 
2-stroke gasoline engines, that are instead powered by 
lightweight, high-speed 4-stroke engines. This company claims to 
achieve emission rates much lower than either current 2-stroke 
engines or engines that would meet the handheld standards 
proposed in this rulemaking. Numerous efforts are also under way 
to develop direct injection systems applicable to larger 2-stroke 
engine-systems that may be able to bring emissions from engines 
such as those used for outboard marine engines down to levels 
equivalent to a well-calibrated 4-stroke engine in the same power 
range. However, the applicability of direct injection systems to 
small engines used in handheld applications has not yet been 
investigated. In developing Phase 2 standards, EPA intends to 
revisit this issue in its entirety and may combine all engines 
under one set of standards, modify the definitions of nonhandheld 
and handheld equipment, as well as the applicable standards, or 
may promulgate an entirely different regulatory structure. 



H. Requirements Applicable to Vehicle and Equipment 
Manufacturers 



EPA is proposing to require that vehicle and equipment 
manufacturers and importers use the appropriate handheld or 
nonhandheld certified engine in their vehicles and equipment. 
Section 213 gives EPA the authority to require nonroad vehicle 
and equipment manufacturers and importers to use certified 
nonroad engines. EPA has determined that the most effective way 
to ensure that certified engines are used in nonroad vehicles and 
equipment is to require that manufacturers and importers use such 
engines. Without such a requirement, there would be no penalty 
for vehicle and equipment manufacturers that knowingly purchase 
noncomplying engines, thus undercutting the entire program. 

EPA is proposing that vehicle and equipment manufacturers 
and importers be subject to the prohibition, injunction, and 
penalty provisions of CAA sections 203, 204, and 205, except that 
only the nonroad engine in the vehicle or equipment, rather than 
the vehicle or equipment itself, would need to be certified for 
compliance. Although engine manufacturers will bear the burden 
of certification under this proposal, the focus of enforcement 
will fall to some extent on vehicle and equipment manufacturers 
because they determine whether a handheld or nonhandheld engine 
is appropriate for use in their vehicle or equipment and will 
ensure that those engines are certified. 

No federal paperwork or reporting burden would be imposed on 
vehicle and equipment manufacturers by the requirement that 
certified nonroad engines be used. This is consistent with the 
nonroad large CI engine proposal (58 FR 28809 at 28815 (May 17, 
1993) and 58 FR 51595 at 51597 (October 4, 1993)). 

Only new engines manufactured on or after the effective date 
of this rule would be subject to the provisions of this rule. 
For example, rebuilt engines originally manufactured prior to the 
effective date of this rule would not be subject to this rule. 
Rebuilt engines originally manufactured after the effective date 
of this rule would be subject only to the tampering provisions. 
New replacement engines manufactured after the effective date 
would be subject to this rule. EPA requests comment on whether 
there is any need for manufacturers to produce replacement 
engines for use in pre-1996 equipment, and the extent of such a 
need, if any. 

Labeling requirements proposed in this notice may also 
impact nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers and importers. 



I. Effective Date 



EPA is proposing an effective date of August 1, 1996 for 
this rulemaking. This midyear effective date coincides with 
model changeover in the small SI engine industry. Engines 
manufactured on or after August 1, 1996 for use within the United 
States would have to meet the standards and requirements included 
in this rulemaking.

Vehicle and equipment manufacturers that use regulated 
engines would be required to use appropriate certified nonroad 
engines in their vehicles and equipment after August 1, 1996. 
EPA requests comment on whether a separate effective date for 
nonroad vehicle and equipment manufacturers should be established 
and, if so, whether that date should be three months after the 
August 1, 1996 effective date for nonroad engine manufacturers 
(that is, November 1, 1996). It appears, based on best available 
data, that the start of large volume equipment production is 
approximately November 1 of every year. EPA is considering this 
separate effective date because it is concerned that equipment 
manufacturers have small inventories of noncertified engines that 
could not be incorporated into equipment by the August 1 
effective date. EPA would consider extending this flexibility to 
six months, that is, February 1, 1997, if manufacturers could 
quantitatively demonstrate that the increased risk of stockpiling 
noncertified engines by the equipment manufacturers would be 
minimal and the inventory buildup would be normal. EPA also 
requests comment on whether a separate effective date for 
equipment manufacturers should be based on introduction of 
equipment into commerce, rather than the date of equipment 
manufacture. 

The August 1996 effective date allows engine manufacturers 
over two years of lead time from the date of this proposal, and 
more than one year beyond the 1995 implementation date imposed by 
CARB. EPA is not proposing the same effective date as CARB in 
order to allow manufacturers some lead time between the CARB and 
federal effective dates to bring preempted engines into 
compliance; however, EPA requests comment on the feasibility of a 
1995 effective date for federal standards, particularly for those 
engines that are not preempted from state regulation. 

While EPA acknowledges the need for sufficient lead time to 
perform research, develop testing capacity, apply emission 
control technology, and manufacture clean engines, EPA's view is 
that engine manufacturers have been aware for a considerable 
period of time that emission regulations were likely to impact 
their products in the near future. In 1990, CARB was required 
under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) to develop emission 
standards for lawn and garden and utility equipment engines by 
December of 1990. In November of 1990, Congress amended the 
federal Clean Air Act, requiring that EPA study emissions of 
nonroad engines and vehicles by November of 1991 and promulgate 
applicable regulations by November of 1992 if these sources were 
found to contribute significantly to air pollution. At a public 
workshop held in March of 1992, EPA discussed the importance of 
emissions from small SI engines, announcing its intent to develop 
applicable regulations. Consequently, manufacturers have known 
since March 1992, at the latest, that EPA was planning to develop 
standards applicable to their products, and have already had more 
than two years to assess emission control technologies and 
develop testing capacity. 

Several state and environmental interest groups have 
expressed concerns that a 1996 effective date delays the 
realization of reductions of in-use air pollutant emissions 
unnecessarily and limits the ability of many states to adhere to 
the schedules mandated in the CAA for reasonable further progress 
toward volatile organic compound reductions from 1990 levels and 
for attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard. Manufacturers have argued that a 1996 effective date 
offers too little lead time given that this proposed rule covers 
various categories of equipment that California is preempted from 
regulating.

Both the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and the Engine Manufacturers Association have requested that EPA extend
the effective date to 1997 for all engines. The Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association has requested
that EPA extend it to 1997 for engines regulated and sold in California and to 1999 for preempted engines and engines
discontinued in California. These industry association requests are available in the docket for this rulemaking.
In all cases, these associations have argued that more lead time is needed to apply these standards to nationwide sales.


EPA requests comment on the impact of its proposed effective date on both engine and equipment manufacturers. EPA
also requests comment on alternative effective dates, including phased effective dates, such as 1996 for nonpreempted
engines and 1997 for preempted engines, or a phase-in by engine size where Class I, II, III, IV, and V engines would meet
the applicable standards at different times based on environmental impact and lead time 
constraints. 





J. Selection of Worst Case Emitter 



EPA is proposing to use the criteria of highest weighted brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) over the appropriate
engine test cycle to determine that engine configuration within an engine family which will be selected as the certification
test engine. EPA believes that BSFC is an appropriate criterion for selecting a worst case emitter. In particular,
EPA believes that an engine configuration with high BSFC will generally emit higher levels of hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide than a second configuration in the same engine family which has a lower BSFC. EPA solicits comments on the
appropriateness of weighted BSFC as the criterion to be used for selecting the worst case emitter. 

EPA considered one alternative method of selecting the worst case emitter. EPA considered leaving the selection
of the worst case emitter up to the engine manufacturer with the guideline that the engine manufacturer must test that
engine configuration within an engine family which is most likely to exceed any emission standard. EPA solicits comment
on the appropriateness of this approach for selecting the worst case emitter. 



K. Adequacy of Test Cycle 



The test procedure proposed in this notice is capable of 
predicting emission reductions at the level of proposed emission 
standards. The proposed test cycles are based on the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practice 

#

J1088. This is 
a procedure that measures emissions over a number of steady state 
operating modes or conditions (speed/load points) and determines 
average emissions over the entire test cycle by weighting the 
modes relative to their likely occurrence in actual use. Much of 
the emission assessment work to date has occurred using the J1088 
test procedures. 

EPA has determined that the types of technology that will be 
forced by setting standards using the proposed test cycle will 
result in real emission reductions in actual use. The current 
feasible technologies are analogue in nature. Thus, when a 
technology is demonstrated to reduce emissions on six discrete 
points on the engine speed/load performance curve, EPA expects 
these technologies will perform in a continuum between those test 
points. No large emission spikes will occur under operating 
conditions that were not specifically tested. 

No time is available to develop a more accurate test cycle. 
While improvements can be made and must be studied before 
proposing more stringent emission standards that require more 
sophisticated technologies, EPA has determined this test cycle is 
adequate to produce the desired emission reductions expected by 
the proposed emission standards. 

As part of the Phase 2 emission regulation process, EPA has 
identified three test modes of the test cycle that it intends to 
study. First, EPA wants to evaluate whether the test procedure 
should be run using the engine's governor to control throttle. 
Second, EPA wants to evaluate the method by which the load points 
used in the test cycle are determined. Third, EPA wants to study 
the sensitivity of emissions to the operating conditions not used 
in the test cycle to ensure emission benefits are not being 
overlooked. 

Operating the engine directly on the governor as opposed to 
on the throttle is allowed in the current test procedure as 
proposed. However, it is optional and most manufacturers choose 
to run the test by directly controlling the throttle. 
Manufacturers do this to reduce the factors that can add 
variability to the test. EPA believes that, since engines in use 
are controlled by the governor, a test cycle that simulates 
actual operation as closely as possible has the potential to 
predict real in-use emissions more accurately. Before such a 
change is adopted, EPA intends to analyze the validity of this 
hypothesis. 

The average power generated during the test cycle has a 
large impact on the emission result. The emission standards are 
based on the mass emission generated for the amount of work 
accomplished (g/kWh). Since power is a factor in how much work 
can be accomplished, it weighs heavily in the final mass emission 
result. EPA wants to ensure that the test cycle does not reflect 
how much power (and thus work) the engine is capable of 
achieving, but is reflective of how much power the equipment 
actually commands from the engine as it does its work. EPA is 
concerned that the actual power drawn by equipment in actual use 
is lower than the average power drawn from the engine during the 
proposed test procedures. EPA does not have time to adequately 
verify this hypothesis within the timeline of this rule, but 
intends to do this during the Phase 2 rulemaking process.

Finally, EPA has not verified that the operating modes in 
the proposed test procedures are the optimal representation of 
what happens in actual use. Any test cycle is at best an 
approximation of the operating conditions experienced by engines 
in actual use. Indeed, any one engine will be installed in a 
range of equipment types and will experience a different 
operating environment in each application. To determine if the 
test procedures are doing the best possible job at estimating 
real world operation, EPA intends to collect data on a full range 
of operating conditions that are not represented in the current 
test cycle. Manufacturers have presented histograms of a range 
of equipment operations such that, for purposes of this notice, 
the test cycle is directionally acceptable. Further 
investigation may result in a determination that the current 
cycle adequately covers the range of operation. However, time is 
not available to make that determination in this proposal. 

Any of the above mentioned changes to the current proposed 
test cycle or procedures would require extensive testing and 
development. All emission data to date is based on the proposed 
test procedures. Before introducing any change in the test 
procedures EPA would have to develop emission standards based on 
the revised procedures and would have to assess emission impact 
on the procedures. The current timeline constraints provide 
neither adequate time to properly assess whether any of these 
changes would benefit the program, nor adequate time to develop 
appropriate emission standards using the revised procedures. 
Faced with these constraints, EPA believes that the proposed test 
procedures are the best available to ensure early emission 
reduction from the engines covered in this notice. 



L. Alternative, Oxygenated, and Reformulated Fuels
 


EPA is not proposing the requirement of any specific type of 
fuel to be used in engines produced to meet the proposed emission 
standards. EPA's proposal would require that all SI engines 
under 19 kW meet the proposed standards. This includes SI 
engines which run on ``alternative'' fuels, such as liquid 
petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas. A few research papers have 
been published which indicate well calibrated spark-ignition 
engines running on LPG fuel may be able to meet the proposed 
emission standards with less difficulty than an equivalent engine 
running on gasoline. EPA proposes to let the engine manufacturer 
decide what type of fuel a given engine application will use and 
not require any specific engine to use a ``cleaner'' fuel. 

EPA's proposal would not allow engines which are designed to 
run on gasoline to perform certification emission testing using 
an alternative fuel. EPA understands that oxygenated and 
reformulated gasoline fuel is currently available in different 
areas around the United States. However, availability of 
oxygenated and reformulated fuels varies widely across the 
country. EPA does not have information that would provide 
adequate assurance that the alternative fuel, and not gasoline, 
would be used in these engines in actual use. Faced with the 
difficulty of tracking small SI engine owners, EPA does not have 
adequate resources, nor an adequate tracking mechanism to enforce 
a requirement that small SI engine owners use only the specified 
alternative fuel. At the same time, preliminary tests performed 
on small engines using reformulated and oxygenated fuels show 
approximately a three to five percent improvement in exhaust 
emission levels of CO and total HC. See the draft RSD in the 
docket for further discussion of this issue. Reformulated fuel 
was designed to lower HC levels from on-highway vehicles, 
primarily engines with fuel injection and catalytic convertors. 
EPA is not convinced it can reasonably expect the same type of 
benefit from carbureted single and two-cylinder engines. EPA 
solicits comment on the feasibility of requiring small SI engines 
to run only on oxygenated or reformulated fuels.




M. HC + NO

X

 Standard for Class I and II Engines 


EPA is considering two options for setting Class I and II 
HC and NOx standards. Option 1 would consist of setting a 
combined standard for emissions of HC and NO

X

 for Class I and II 
engines. Under option 2, EPA would set separate HC and NO

X

 
emission levels for Class I and II engines. 

Regardless of which option EPA chooses, it anticipates that 
NO

X

 emission rates from engines meeting this proposed rule's 
standards will be generally higher than those extremely low NO

X

 
levels emitted by current engines. The Agency views this as an 
inevitable consequence of the level of HC reduction being 
achieved in this rule. Furthermore, EPA estimates that the 
resulting increase in NO

X

 emission inventories would be slight 
enough in this particular case to be warranted given the much 
greater decrease in HC emission inventories. See ``VI. 
Environmental Benefit Assessment'' in this preamble. 

Nonroad small SI engines currently operate on an extremely 
rich fuel and air mixture_in other words, one that contains a 
very high proportion of fuel relative to that used by, for 
example, automotive engines. Because this results both in less 
complete combustion and much lower peak combustion temperatures, 
exhaust concentrations of unburned HC are extremely high, while 
concentrations of NO

X

 are extremely low. As a result, small SI 
engines contribute appreciably to HC emission inventories, but 
very little to NO

X

 emission inventories.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the 19 ozone nonattainment areas studied by EPA in the 1991 Nonroad Study, emissions from all nonroad sources, on
average, represented ten percent of total HC emissions and 17 percent of total NO

X

 emissions. Of those contributions, small SI engines contributed an average of 50 percent of total HC from nonroad
sources, but only one percent of total NO

X

. In contrast, nonroad large CI engines, for which EPA has proposed NO

X

 standards, contributed an average of ten percent of total HC from nonroad sources and 75 percent of total NO

X

. Consequently, EPA's primary focus in developing emission standards for small SI engines is achieving sizeable
reductions in HC emission rates.

Given the extremely rich operation of small SI engines, EPA does not believe that small engine technology is available
to prevent NO

X

 levels from increasing while HC levels decrease substantially within the short lead time period set forth in this
proposal. While it may be possible in some isolated cases to employ automotive-type emission control systems relying
on closed-loop operation and three-way catalytic converters, the state of development of such technology is not
ready for small engine application in the short lead time proposed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of such systems
to in-use deterioration and malmaintenance would greatly lessen their in-use effectiveness given the state of the
service industry available to these engines.

EPA has estimated that by the year 2020, when current equipment turnover is projected, the proposed emission standards
would result in approximately a 32 percent reduction in HC emission from current levels, or 356,710 tons per year.
Under the same timeframe, in-use NO

X

 emission rates would be expected to increase 1.36-fold, or 34,000 tons per year. Given the magnitude of the relative
contribution of these small SI engines to HC and NO

X

 emission inventories in ozone nonattainment areas, EPA believes this projected decrease in HC and increase in NO

X

 levels would be consistent with EPA's statutory mandate that emissions standards reflect the greatest emission
reductions achievable. This is especially the case in light of the fact that this rule would increase the national
NO

X

 inventory by about one quarter of one percent, while EPA's nonroad large CI engine regulations would reduce the national
NO

X

 inventory by about four percent.

EPA anticipates that, given the magnitude of the HC reduction proposed, emission rates would be marginally sensitive
enough that near-term compliance with separate emission standards at the proposed level of stringency could be difficult
in some cases, whereas compliance with a combined standard is expected to be achievable.

However, EPA is concerned that establishing a combined standard might be viewed as setting a precedent for future
rulemakings. EPA does not intend to establish any such precedent, and is considering a combined standard for Phase
1 only due to the present lack of available data for setting a separate NO

X

 standard, the current lack of technology for achieving NO

X

 reductions simultaneously with HC reductions for the subject engines and vehicles, the need to achieve HC reductions
as soon as possible under the Phase 1 rule, and the desire to harmonize with California's standards.

EPA requests comment on a combined standard (option 1). EPA also requests comments and data supporting separate numerical
standards for HC and NO

X

 (option 2). Based on information currently available to EPA, if it were necessary to develop separate standards,
the NO

X

 standard would be approximately 136 percent higher than current new engine levels, while the HC standards would be
approximately equal to the difference between those levels and the proposed HC+NO

X

 standards.



N. CO Standard for Handheld Engines Over 50 cc



EPA is concerned that the CO levels for handheld engines be kept as low as possible. The operators of equipment using
these engines are in close proximity to the exhaust pipe. The Class V engines are a large concern. The majority of these
engines are used on large commercial chain saws used in logging operations. The high power and high load factors associated
with this equipment mean the operator is potentially exposed to a high CO rate from the engine and could experience
high CO intake during operation.

EPA is proposing to limit CO emissions from large (Class V) handheld engines to 402 g/kWh. In comparison, smaller (Class
III, IV) handheld engines would be required to meet the higher standard of 804 g/kWh. The larger Class V engines have
technical advantages over smaller engines, with respect to fuel metering and combustion chamber boundary layer
conditions, that would allow them to achieve these lower levels of CO emission. This technical rationale is discussed
at length in the draft RSD in the docket. In addition to the technical rationale that the Class V engines are capable
of lower CO emission levels, a number of engines were tested by the Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association
(PPEMA) and an individual manufacturer, modified for a six percent enleanment over current production calibration.
Approximately 20 to 30 percent of these engines met the 402 

g/kWh CO standard, achieving average CO levels of eight percent below the standard. The remaining engines tested
did not meet either the HC or the CO emission standards. (See data in the draft RSD.) EPA observed that, in general, port
design may affect the ease with which engines can meet emission standards. EPA requests comment and data on whether
there is a supportable technical rationale why it would not be feasible to further optimize these engines to bring
both the HC and CO emissions into line with the engines capable of achieving the proposed standards. 



PPEMA has argued that the 402 

g/kWh level is too stringent, but did not focus on Class V engines at the time California rules were being considered
since its members anticipated limited regulation of the Class V engines in California due to preemption of many of
the products in which these engines are used. In a letter to EPA, a copy of which is included in the docket for this rulemaking,
PPEMA suggests that a standard of 603 g/kWh would be more appropriate. EPA would need further data and information
that establishes 603 g/kWh as the appropriate technical limit and addresses the need for this higher CO standard as
noted above. 



Based on the data currently available, EPA does not see the need for the higher standard and believes that the proposed
standard is achievable. However, EPA is requesting additional information and data that would verify the need for
the higher standard and justify why all engines cannot be designed to meet the CO levels achieved by the 20 to 30 percent
of engines tested by PPEMA that met all proposed standards. 



O. Cap on Noise 



EPA is proposing to require that engine noise levels not increase as a result of this rulemaking. The type of engine
changes which EPA believes will be used to meet the proposed exhaust gaseous emission standards should not increase
engine noise above current levels. EPA is aware that several European nations currently have sound level standards
for different classes of nonroad equipment, some of which are powered by SI engines less than 19 kW. EPA lacks the necessary
information to determine if regulating engine noise without regard to the type of equipment in which the engine will
eventually be used is a sensible technical approach. EPA requests data and comments on this issue. 



P. Applicability of In-Use Standards 



The proposed rule does not require that small engines meet in-use standards over a useful life period for several reasons.
First, limited emission testing of in-use engines has been performed. Additional data will be provided by the in-use
testing program described in ``IV.C. Program Description and Rationale.'' Second, EPA does not believe that emission
controls proposed for Phase 1 will experience significant deterioration beyond normal engine deterioration, although
this area needs more research. EPA does acknowledge its responsibility to achieve enforceable reductions of in-use
emissions and plans to develop such measures in its long-term Phase 2 program. 

Until such measures are developed, EPA proposes to maintain regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA
to setting in-use standards and useful life periods by April 1997. In developing Phase 2 regulations, EPA intends
to amend this language, replacing it with regulatory language specifying programs that are developed to meet this
commitment. 

EPA solicits comment on the lack of in-use standards and on the appropriate level of in-use standards, useful life
period, and enforcement measures if EPA were to make these a requirement of Phase 1. EPA also invites comment on the
regulatory language in the Phase 1 rule that commits EPA to developing these requirements by April 1997. This language
states, ``A useful life period for engines subject to the provisions of subpart A of this part will be set by the Agency
and will be promulgated no later than the year 1997.'' 



Q. In-Use Testing Requirement 



This proposal requires that manufacturers procure and test a sample of in-use engines and report the results to EPA.
In developing this program, EPA considered manufacturer suggestions that any in-use testing program be conducted
jointly between EPA, manufacturers, and manufacturers' organizations. EPA is concerned that a joint program would
not as efficiently address the goals of the proposed in-use testing program. 

EPA is proposing the in-use testing requirement with two main goals in mind. Primarily, EPA believes that a critical
element in the success of its nonroad program is assuring that manufacturers build engines that continue to meet emission
standards beyond the certification and production stages. By requiring manufacturers to test and report results,
EPA expects that manufacturers would act responsibly to avoid or correct in-use emission problems.

EPA's authority to recall engines which do not comply with 
emission standards in use provides an important incentive to on-highway manufacturers to design and build durable
engines and 
vehicles. However, at this time, EPA has limited data by which 
to propose in-use standards for small SI engines under section 
213(d) of the CAA, subjecting nonroad engine manufacturers to the 
requirements of section 207(c) of the CAA. Because EPA is not 
proposing to establish in-use emission standards in this 
rulemaking, it is necessary to require that manufacturers test 
in-use engines to gain important knowledge about the emission 
deterioration of their engines and report the results to EPA. 
EPA expects that this knowledge will be critical to developing 
more durable emission control systems and achieving better in-use 
compliance with Phase 2 engines. 
An auxiliary outcome of this Phase 1 testing program would 
be that manufacturers, by working closely with EPA to evaluate 
in-use emissions and identify solutions to problems, would be 
preparing for the Phase 2 in-use compliance program. This Phase 
1 testing program would permit issues associated with a variety 
of maintenance and use conditions to be identified and resolved 
prior to Phase 2. 
As stated previously, EPA is concerned that these goals may 
not be as fully achieved with joint testing programs involving 
several manufacturers and their respective organizations. By 
requiring direct communication with EPA, manufacturers would have 
to individually provide test data showing in-use performance. 
EPA's experience has been that aggregate data (sorted by 
organizations and stripped of engine identification) is not 
effective in identifying specific in-use problems. The 
generated Phase 1 in-use data would improve estimates of in-use 
emissions, thereby enhancing the basis for emission inventories 
used to support the State Implementation Plan (SIP) development 
process. 
Given the critical feedback the in-use testing program would 
provide, EPA believes it is compelled to ensure the fulfillment 
of the obligation to perform in-use testing. For engine families 
where in-use testing would be required, certification is proposed 
to be conditioned upon the completion of a number of in-use tests 
as agreed upon by EPA and the manufacturer at the time of 
certification. Completion of the number of valid in-use tests as 
agreed, regardless of the test results, would satisfy this 
condition. 
Under this proposal, a manufacturer's failure to fully 
execute the in-use tests would be considered a failure to satisfy 
the conditions under which the certificate was issued. An engine 
would be considered to be covered by the certificate only if the 
manufacturer fulfilled the conditions upon which the certificate 
was issued. Thus, failure to satisfy the conditions of the 
certificate could subject a manufacturer to the imposition of 
civil penalties. However, EPA recognizes that a manufacturer, 
notwithstanding its best efforts, might fail to perform the 
required testing due to circumstances beyond its control. Thus EPA would consider all relevant factors when determining
whether 
to view an engine as not being covered by a certificate based on 
failure of a manufacturer to fully execute the test program 
condition of the certificate. 
EPA requests comment on the proposed in-use testing program.

R. Absence of Averaging, Banking, and Trading Programs 


EPA is not proposing an averaging, banking, and trading 
program (ABT) for small SI engines at this time. ABT programs, 
which EPA uses in its on-highway heavy-duty engine program and 
proposed for the nonroad large CI engine program, provide 
manufacturers flexibility in meeting the emission standards. EPA 
is increasingly using market-based incentive programs such as ABT 
because such programs can reduce the cost of controlling 
emissions. An ABT trading program can also reduce the burden of 
regulation on small manufacturers by providing them flexibility 
in meeting requirements. 
At this time, EPA has not been able to construct an ABT 
program, given the uncertainties surrounding projected in-use 
emission levels. These uncertainties will be resolved as part of 
the Phase 2 regulatory negotiations. However, as part of the 
requirements of approving an ABT program, EPA must know the in- 
use emission characteristics of engine families in order to 
implement an ABT standard, unless all engine families deteriorate 
at the same rate. 
The lifetime emissions of engine families must be averaged 
together in order to compute the average emission level of a 
manufacturer's product line. Use of lifetime emissions is 
necessary because it may be the case that the emissions of one 
type of engine deteriorate at a higher rate than another type, or 
a smaller engine may deteriorate at a higher rate than a larger 
engine of the same type. EPA is not in a position to determine 
what the in-use emission level is presently or would be under 
this Phase 1 regulation. EPA's initial assessment is that the 
emissions of these engines deteriorate somewhat over time and 
likely deteriorate at different rates between engine families, 
but more research is necessary. However, even if engine families 
deteriorate at different rates, if such deterioration is not 
systematically biased, it may not undermine the validity of an 
ABT program. EPA requests comment on this point. 
Phase 2 will directly assess in-use emission characteristics 
of engine families and incorporate enforcement of in-use emission 
levels. Once in-use emission levels are known with more 
confidence, EPA expects that market-based programs such as ABT 
will be viewed favorably by the regulatory negotiation committee 
during policy development. 
EPA requests comment on the absence of an ABT program. 


S. Engine Manufacturer Requirement_Disclosure of Maximum 
Exhaust Pressure and Minimum Inlet Pressure 


The design of the exhaust system can influence emissions. 
Most small engines are supplied with both an air inlet system and 
an exhaust system which are tested as part of the engine package, 
and the entire package is used by the equipment manufacturer. 
However, some engines are designed to be installed in a chassis 
with more complex packaging requirements where the equipment 
manufacturer may supply and/or install the exhaust system, or 
part of it, and even the air inlet system. In these latter cases, 
EPA is considering a requirement that the engine manufacturer 
would need to specify to the equipment manufacturer the maximum 
exhaust pressure and the minimum inlet pressure, and the 
equipment manufacturer would be required to adhere to those 
specifications. EPA requests both engine and equipment 
manufacturer comments regarding this issue. 


T. Direct Health Effects of Air Toxics and CO 


In addition to the concern of the role of HC and CO in ozone 
and CO nonattainment, EPA is concerned about direct health 
effects of air toxics and CO exposure. The concentrations and 
direct health effects of toxic pollutants in exhaust are 
especially important because the operator of a small SI engine 
application is typically near the equipment as it functions. In 
some applications, the operator must be adjacent to the exhaust 
outlet and is in the direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the 
engine. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment'' for further 
discussion of this issue. The Agency requests additional 
information on the effects of air toxics and CO exposure 
associated with the use of small SI engines. 


U. Catalyst Durability 


Relative to all other types of emission-related engine 
components, catalysts are unique in that: 
 Relatively small changes in chemical and/or physical 
characteristics of a catalyst can result in very large 
deleterious changes in operational characteristics. 
 The engine manufacturer is not likely to be involved in 
the design or fabrication of the catalysts nor be able to 
verify the acceptability of vendor-supplied catalysts by 
means of the simple checks and tests that are adequate for 
other engine components. 
 The satisfactory operational durability of catalysts are 
much more dependent on the catalyst manufacturer's 
proprietary techniques and processes than is the case with 
other emission control system components. 
 Since it is the last component in the emission control 
system, a catalyst can compensate for sub-standard 
performances by other emission control components, but it is 
not itself supported by any other back-up component that is 
able to compensate for a reduction in catalyst performance 
capability. 
 Substantial reductions in performance can result from:

 

_Abrasion or fracturing as a result of relative motion 
between the catalyst and its protective outer metal 
jacket, 
_Poisoning as a result of fuel contaminants (such as 
lead), 
_Glazing as a result of excessive quantities of 
lubricating oil in the exhaust, and 
_Thermal degradation as a result of exposure to 
excessively high temperatures for prolonged periods.

 

Catalytic converters designed for small SI engines in the 
short term will be low efficiency catalysts to address safety 
concerns. The catalysts designed for potential Phase 1 use would 
have conversion efficiencies on the order of approximately 30 
percent for HC and CO emission. The design constraint that 
dictates these low efficiencies is the need to limit the increase 
in exhaust temperatures, since the exhaust is in close proximity 
to the operator in handheld equipment. Efficiencies much higher 
than 30 percent begin to generate exotherms that can 
substantially increase exhaust temperatures. Since the industry 
has not yet developed the necessary solutions, such as creative 
small-scale insulation approaches, to control the added 
temperature, only low efficiency catalysts would be available for 
Phase 1 use.

While adequate durability of catalysts is a concern relative 
to catalytic converters used in on-highway engine applications, 
EPA is less concerned with the emission impact of failures of the 
catalytic converters expected to be used for engines regulated by 
this rule. This is because the conversion efficiency of 
catalysts used in small SI engines would not exceed approximately 
30 percent for reasons discussed in the previous paragraph. 
Faced with this constraint, an engine manufacturer would need to 
modify its base engine to realize substantial emission reduction 
of engine-out emissions even before the exhaust was converted 
further by the catalytic converter. Should such a low efficiency 
catalyst fail in use, the increase in emissions would not be as 
large as occurs when a high efficiency on-highway vehicle 
catalyst fails. 
The preceding discussion underscores the need for some means 
to validate the adequacy of catalysts that would be added to 
engines to provide compliance with the emission standards during 
in-use operation. Various approaches could be used for ensuring 
that the ``long term'' conversion capabilities of catalysts would 
be adequate. For example, certification engines could be tested 
with catalysts which had been subjected to some type of ``aging'' 
process to substantiate that the catalysts were adequately 
designed and fabricated. Alternatively, certification engines 
could be tested with new catalysts that had been proven to be 
satisfactory by meeting the requirements of a catalyst 
certification procedure that would be separate from the engine 
emission certification test. 
The main advantage of a validation approach involving the 
use of ``aged'' catalysts on certification engines would be its 
simplicity. The aging process would be carried out by either the 
engine manufacturers or the catalyst vendors. In either case, 
there would be no requirements for special catalyst performance 
testing and, hence, no need for the establishment of performance 
standards that would be needed for evaluating the test results. 
The main disadvantage of this approach is the possible 
negative impact on catalyst usage that might result from a Phase 
1 certification process which imposed durability testing 
requirements on catalysts but not on certification engines or any 
other engine components involved in their construction. On one 
hand, the dependence of successful certification of engine 
families on the performance capabilities of aged catalysts might 
result in engine manufacturers being reluctant to use catalysts 
to meet the applicable emission standards. Also, given that 
there is limited field data on small engine catalysts, it would 
be extremely difficult to design a fair aging procedure that 
could be evaluated by the certification engine test and 
accompanying emission standards. 
Such possibly adverse results would be avoided by the engine 
manufacturer's use of a new catalyst that was ``certified'' by the 
supplier or the engine manufacturer as having design and 
fabrication details that resulted in specific long-term 
conversion performance capabilities. This approach would have 
the disadvantage of being more complicated in that it 
additionally involves the establishment of limits on the amount 
of efficiency loss that would be acceptable and would require a 
test procedure for determining compliance with such limits. 
As a consequence of concerns regarding possible negative 
impacts on catalyst development for small engines that might 
result from a provision requiring the certification of engines 
with aged catalysts, EPA is not proposing such a requirement in 
this notice. Instead, EPA is proposing that for systems 
utilizing catalysts, the certification engine configuration to be 
tested must be equipped with a new catalyst of a design that has 
been ``certified.'' A ``certified'' catalyst design would be one 
which had successfully met the requirements of a separate 
catalyst durability demonstration procedure which is described in 
more detail in the following paragraphs. This approach ensures 
that durable catalysts are used on small engines while avoiding 
excessive requirements that could discourage the development of 
very promising catalyst technology. 
Comments regarding this proposal are requested. Also 
requested are comments regarding the advantages and disadvantages 
of this requirement, as well as the alternative requirement for 
the use of preconditioned or aged catalysts during engine 
emission certification testing. 
The use of an oven exposure procedure for evaluating 
catalyst resistance to thermal degradation is proposed in this 
notice. This procedure would involve the heating of the test 
catalyst in air to a temperature of 1,000 
 C for six hours. 
Prior to heating the catalyst to 1,000 
 C, an optional pre- 
heating procedure is proposed to be allowed to remove the 
``green'' effect of the catalyst. This optional procedure would 
consist of heating the catalyst to no more than 500 
 C for no 
more than two hours. 
The oven exposure procedure described above is proposed in 
lieu of procedures which involve exposure to synthetic or actual 
exhaust gas mixtures because EPA believes that the oven aging 
procedure aggressively and directly stresses the catalyst and is 
the best method for assessing the most major catalyst durability 
concern: thermal stability. Another advantage of this method is 
that it is much less complex than the other exposure procedures. 
For example, in the case of the procedure which involves 
exposure to synthetic exhaust gas mixtures, information is 
lacking regarding the most appropriate test parameters, such as 
the temperature of the mixtures and the duration of the exposure. 
Similarly, with respect to the procedure which involves exposure 
to actual exhaust gas mixtures, information is needed regarding a 
number of test variables that are related to the engine that is 
used to generate the exhaust gas mixture, such as its combustion 
cycle and power output, the manner in which it is operated and 
the operating times that are involved in each phase of the 
operating cycle.

General comments regarding the applicability and 
suitability of the proposed oven exposure procedure are 
requested. Specific comments are also requested regarding 
variation in the procedure, such as: The use of an oven 
atmosphere other than air; if flow through the catalyst is 
recommended; and the composition and flow rate of the gas or 
gaseous mixture that is used. 
Regardless of which method is used to age the catalyst, some 
means must be used to determine the effects of the aging process. 
With respect to the intended purpose of this process, the most 
straightforward evaluation would involve the determination of the 
extent to which the performance characteristics of the test 
catalyst had been adversely affected. Of particular significance 
would be the adverse effect on the catalyst's conversion 
capabilities with respect to the oxidation of HC and CO and/or 
the reduction of NO

X

. 
The use of a procedure which uses a synthetic exhaust gas 
mixture for evaluating the effects of thermal stressing is being 
proposed for several reasons. One of the main reasons is the 
relative simplicity of such a procedure. For example, it would 
not involve the questions regarding the in-use representativeness 
of test parameters, such as the temperature of the mixture and 
the duration of the test, that arise when a synthetic exhaust gas 
mixture is used for actually thermally stressing a catalyst. For 
evaluation purposes, any fixed temperature which allowed the 
conversion reactions of interest to occur could be specified. 
The specification of a particular exposure time would not be 
required since the conversion efficiency existing as a result of 
the previous thermal stressing would be involved rather than a 
time-related change in efficiency. Furthermore, a procedure 
which used synthetic exhaust gas would be simpler than a 
procedure that used actual exhaust gas. Using synthetic exhaust 
gas mixtures alleviates the need for detailed information not 
readily available at this time. Another reason for proposing the 
use of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures is the standardization that 
results; all catalysts would be aged under the specific 
conditions that are proposed in subpart E of the proposed 
regulations. The composition of the synthetic exhaust gas 
mixture that is specified in this subpart is comparable to 
compositions of synthetic exhaust gas mixtures currently used by 
catalyst manufacturers for testing related to the kinds of 
engines covered by the proposal. 
Comments are solicited concerning these specifications, 
particularly with regard to the chemical composition and 
temperature of the synthetic exhaust mixture and its flow rate as 
it enters the test catalyst. 
A fixed catalyst efficiency loss limit of 20 percent for HC, 
CO, and NO

X

 is proposed in this notice on the basis of on-highway 
experience and the absence of information at this time regarding 
the conversion efficiencies that will be used with small engines. 
To illustrate this loss limit, a catalyst with initial HC 
conversion efficiency of 50 percent would be required to maintain 
at least a conversion efficiency of 40 percent after thermal 
aging. 
Comments are requested regarding the use of a different 
fixed deterioration limit. Comments are also requested regarding 
the relative advantages and disadvantages of one fixed limit 
versus several limits that are proportional to initial conversion 
efficiency. 


V. Test Procedure Requirements 


EPA received a technical review of an early draft of the 
test procedure from the Small Engine Committee of the Society of 
Automotive Engineers (SAE) in September 1993. EPA requests 
comment on several points mentioned in SAE's comments. 
EPA is proposing that during each mode of the emission test 
cycle, engine manufacturers collect and analyze exhaust 
constituents and measure engine parameters during a period of 
time referred to as the ``sampling period.'' EPA is proposing that 
the sampling period be a minimum of four minutes long. The SAE 
recommended test procedure J1088 recommends the sampling period 
be ``* * * at least two minutes. Longer averaging times may be 
required to ascertain the true time averaged emissions if data 
variability over time is significant.'' Based on EPA's experience 
with several small (two to four kW) engines, a two-minute 
averaging time for idle modes is not sufficient to make accurate 
fuel flow measurements. EPA requests comment on the 
appropriateness of a four minute averaging time, including any 
available test data to substantiate an averaging time less than 
four minutes. 
EPA is proposing that for the final calculation of the 
brake-specific emission rate (gr/kWh), any power measured during 
the idle mode not be included in the calculation for the reported 
brake-specific emission rate. EPA believes the idle mode is, by 
definition, that engine operating mode during which no useful 
work is performed. Any power measured during this mode is a 
result of the frictional losses resulting from the dynamometer. 
EPA is concerned that an engine manufacturer using an 
inappropriately large dynamometer with a large frictional loss 
would not provide an accurate measurement of the engine idle 
mode. EPA believes it is inappropriate to include power generated 
by the engine to overcome the windage losses of the dynamometer 
in the calculation of emissions during the idle mode. EPA 
requests comment on the appropriateness of including power 
measured by the dynamometer in the calculation of the final 
brake-specific emission rate.

W. Duration of Certificates of Conformity, Definition of Model 
Year, Annual Production Period 


EPA is considering adopting one of the following three 
options for defining model year, annual production period, and 
duration of the certificate of conformity. Regardless of the 
option selected, EPA is also proposing in this notice that it 
would be a prohibited act to introduce an uncertified small SI 
engine into commerce after August 1, 1996. Furthermore, it would 
be a prohibited act to introduce a specific model year engine 
into commerce prior to or after the model year for which the 
certificate of conformity was issued and in effect. EPA requests 
comment on each of these three alternatives. 


Option 1: 

EPA would incorporate the on-highway definition 
of model year, annual production period, and duration of a 
certificate of conformity. 
The model year would include January 1 of the calendar year 
for which it is designated and would not include a January 1 of 
any other calendar year. Thus, the maximum duration of a model 
year would be one calendar year plus 364 days. 
The ``annual production period'' for any specific model within 
an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was 
first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year 
preceding the year for which the model year was designated, 
whichever date was later. The annual production period would end 
either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on December 
31 of the calendar year for which the model year was named, 
whichever date was sooner. 
A certificate of conformity would be issued to cover engines 
introduced into commerce for a single model year. Under option 
1, the 1997 model year certificate could cover production between 
January 2, 1996 and December 31, 1997, although engines regulated 
under this proposal would be manufactured after August 1, 1996. 
Interested parties may wish to consult OMS Advisory Circular 
A/C No. 6B, issued December 31, 1987, which summarizes the on-highway treatment of model year, annual production
period, and 
duration of the certificate of conformity. A copy of the 
circular has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. 


Option 2: 

This option represents a variation of Option 1. 
EPA believes that the dates selected for the commencement of 
model year and the annual production period more closely parallel 
the experience of the small engine industry. 
Under option 2, the model year would include August 1 of the 
preceding calendar year for which it was designated and would not 
include an August 1 of any other calendar year. The maximum 
duration of a model year would remain one calendar year plus 364 
days. 
The ``annual production period'' for a specific model within 
an engine family would begin either: (1) When such an engine was 
first produced, or (2) on August 2 of two calendar years 
preceding the year for which the model year was designated, 
whichever date was later. The annual production period would end 
either: (1) When the last engine was produced, or (2) on July 31 
of the calendar year for which the model year was named, 
whichever date was sooner. 
The certificate of conformity would be issued to cover 
production for a single model year. For example, the 1997 model 
year could cover production between August 2, 1995 through July 
31, 1997. 
The proposed extended coverage period described in options 1 
and 2 for a certificate of conformity (that is, up to one year 
plus 364 days) is primarily intended to allow flexibility in the 
production of new models. Under no circumstances should it be 
interpreted that existing models could ``skip'' yearly 
certification by pulling ahead the production of every other 
model year. While this situation, to our knowledge, has not 
occurred in the on-highway program in the past, a practice of 
producing small SI engines for a two year period would violate 
Congress' intent of annual certification based upon an 

annual

 
production period. EPA is not currently proposing rules for how 
to determine when abuse has occurred since this has not been a 
problem to date. However, manufacturers should note EPA's 
concern in this area and should use normal yearly production 
periods for existing models. 


Option 3: 

Under this option, the certificate of conformity 
would be issued to cover production from August 1 of a given 
calendar year through July 31 of the subsequent calendar year for 
which it was issued. EPA would retain the model year concept 
found in on-highway programs but would define it as follows: 
``

Model year 

means the manufacturer's annual production period 
which includes August 1 of a given calendar year through July 31 
of the subsequent calendar year.'' Thus the maximum duration of a 
model year would be 365 days. 


VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment 


National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have been set 
for criteria pollutants which adversely affect human health, 
vegetation, materials, and visibility. Concentrations of ozone 
(O

3

) are impacted by HC emissions and, to a lesser extent, 
emissions of CO. Ambient concentrations of CO are, of course, 
impacted by CO emissions. EPA has determined that the standards 
set in this rule would reduce emissions of HC and CO and, despite 
also increasing emissions of NO

X

, help most areas come into 
compliance with the NAAQS for ozone and, to a lesser extent, CO. 
The following provides a summary of the emission reductions 
expected and the health effects of HC components, CO, and ozone. 
A discussion of the roles of HC and NO

X

 in ozone formation is 
also presented. The underlying analysis is described in greater 
detail in the draft RSD, a copy of which is in the public docket 
for this rulemaking.

A. Estimated Emissions Impact of Proposed Regulation 


The emission standards proposed in today's action should 
reduce average per-engine HC and CO emission from small SI 
engines by 32 percent and 14 percent, respectively, by the year 
2020, when complete fleet turnover is projected. This would 
result in annual nationwide reductions of roughly 350,000 tons of 
HC and 2,000,000 tons of CO by the year 2020. In-use NO

emission rates are expected to increase, roughly, from 7,000 to 
34,000 tons per year. This increase represents one quarter of 
one percent of the national NO

X

 inventory, and is small compared 
to the substantial NO

X

 reductions achieved in the nonroad large 
CI proposal (58 FR 28809). 
In addition to control of HC, the proposed standards should 
be effective in reducing emissions of air toxics, including 
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. However, the magnitude of reduction 
would depend on whether the control technology reduces the 
individual toxics in the same proportion to total hydrocarbons. 
These emission reduction estimates for HC and CO are based 
on population projections using estimates of annual engine 
consumption (that is, sales), engine attrition (that is, 
scrappage), activity indicator, and current and proposed in-use 
emission factors. Data on activity indicators and the baseline 
emission factors were obtained from the Nonroad Study. Estimates 
of annual engine consumption for years from 1973 to 1992 were 
based on engine consumption data available from the PSR databases 
and industry data from OPEI,
 PPEMA,
 and Booz Allen & 
Hamilton.
 Future consumption estimates are for the most part 
based on estimates of population growth for the United States. 
Attrition rates (that is, likelihood, as a function of engine 
age, that an engine remains in service) for all engines included 
in this analysis were developed on the assumption that equipment 
attrition is described by a two-parameter form of the Weibull 
cumulative distribution function. 








For the analysis summarized in Tables 2 and 3, the emission 
inventories were developed for the five regulated engine classes 
as well as for all pieces of equipment using engines covered by 
this proposed rule. Using estimated engine consumption and 
attrition, EPA projected the total in-service engine population 
for each year from 1973 through 2020. EPA projected the total 
annual nationwide HC, CO, and NO

X

 emissions from small SI engines 
included in the current proposal under the baseline (that is, no 
controls applied) and controlled scenarios. 
For the controlled scenario, EPA assumed that new engines 
sold beginning in 1996 would meet the proposed standards. For 
both scenarios, in-use emission rates were determined so as to 
account for deterioration by adjusting the difference between new 
engine and in-use engine emission rates by a factor which is a 
function of age of the specific engine and its B-50 or median 
life expressed in years.

B. Health and Welfare Effects of HC Emissions 


The focus of today's action is reduction of HC emission as a 
part of the solution to the ozone nonattainment problem. 
However, direct health effects are also a reason for concern due 
to direct human exposure to emissions from small SI engines 
during operation of equipment using such engines. Of specific 
concern is the emission of air toxics. In some applications, the 
operator must be adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the 
direct path of the exhaust as it leaves the engine. Today's 
regulations should be effective in reducing air toxics such as 
benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 
Based on data from the Nonroad Study, the exhaust and 
crankcase emissions from a 2.9 kW lawnmower with a 4-stroke 
engine contain 3.5 grams of benzene per hour. Exhaust emission 
of a 2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower contains 17 grams of benzene per 
hour. A small, 2.2 kW chainsaw emits 28.2 grams of benzene per 
hour, compared to a large, 4.5 kW chainsaw that emits 40.8 grams 
per hour. 
Also, according to data from the Nonroad Study, 1,3- 
butadiene content in exhaust and crankcase emissions from a 2.9 
kW, 4-stroke lawnmower is approximately 1.5 grams per hour. For a 
2.9 kW, 2-stroke lawnmower, 1,3-butadiene content in exhaust is 
7.0 grams per hour. Butadiene emitted from a small, 2.2 kW 
chainsaw is approximately 12.2 grams per hour, and is 17.7 grams 
per hour from a large 4.5 kW chainsaw. 
Benzene is a clear, colorless aromatic hydrocarbon which is 
both volatile and flammable. Benzene is present in both exhaust 
and evaporative emissions. Health effects caused by benzene 
emissions differ based on concentration and duration of exposure. 
1,3-butadiene is a colorless, flammable gas at room 
temperature. This suspected human carcinogen is insoluble in 
water and its two conjugated double bonds make it highly 
reactive. 1,3-Butadiene is formed in internal combustion engine 
exhaust by the incomplete combustion of the fuel and is assumed 
not present in evaporative and refueling emissions. 
Since air toxic levels generally decrease in proportion to 
overall emissions once emission control technology is applied, 
the amount of benzene and 1,3-butadiene produced by new small SI 
engines should diminish after this rule becomes effective. 
Consequently, exposure to air toxics from new small SI engines 
will be reduced, as will associated health effects. 
There is little data on direct health effects of small SI 
engine emissions. No study has been conducted involving the 
health effects of air toxic emissions specifically from small SI 
engines. The Agency requests additional information on this 
topic. 


C. Health and Welfare Effects of CO Emissions 


Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas which can 
be emitted into ambient air as a result of both natural processes 
and human activity. Although CO exists as a trace element in the 
troposphere, much of human exposure resulting in elevated levels 
of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) in the blood is due to incomplete 
fossil fuel combustion, as occurs in small SI engines. 
The concentration and direct health effect of CO exposure 
are especially important in small SI engines because the operator 
of a small SI engine application is typically near the equipment 
as it functions. In some applications, the operator must be 
adjacent to the exhaust outlet and is in the direct path of the 
exhaust as it leaves the engine. According to numbers published 
in the Nonroad Study, a 4-stroke, 2.9 kW lawnmower engine emits 
1051.1 g/hr CO, while a 2-stroke, 2.9 kW engine emits 1188.4 g/hr 
CO. 
Although no studies measuring the human health effects of CO 
emanating from small SI engine exhaust have been conducted, ample 
research results are available concerning general health effects 
of exposure to CO. The toxicity of CO effects on blood and 
tissues, and how these effects manifest themselves as organ 
function changes have been topics of substantial research 
efforts. However, most of these involved higher, more constant 
exposure concentration levels of CO than are likely to be 
produced under normal operations of these small SI engines. Such 
studies provided information for establishing the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard for CO. The current primary and 
secondary NAAQS for CO are 9 parts per million for the one-hour 
average and 35 parts per million for the eight-hour average. 


D. Roles of HC and NO

X

 in Ozone Formation 



Both HC and NO

X

 contribute to the formation of tropospheric 
ozone through a complex series of reactions. In general, the 
ratio between the ambient concentrations of HC and NO

X

 in a 
localized area is an indicator of the likely effectiveness of HC 
and/or NO

X

 reductions as ozone control measures. If the level of 
HC is high relative to the level of NO

X

 (that is, in a ratio of 
20 to one), ozone formation is limited by the amount of NO

X

 
present, making reduction of NO

X

 emission an effective strategy 
for reducing ozone levels. Alternatively, if the level of HC is 
low relative to the level of NO

X

 (that is, in a ratio of eight to 
one), efforts to control HC would be expected to be a more 
effective means of reducing ozone concentration. In a recent 
report, researchers emphasize that both HC and NO

X

 controls are 
needed in most areas of the United States.






E. Health and Welfare Effects of Tropospheric Ozone 


EPA's primary reason for controlling emissions from small 
SI engines is the role of HC in forming ozone. Of the major air 
pollutants for which NAAQS have been designated under the CAA, 
the most widespread problem continues to be ozone, which is the 
most prevalent photochemical oxidant and an important component 
of smog. Ozone is a product of the atmospheric chemical 
reactions involving oxides of nitrogen and other compounds. 
These reactions occur as atmospheric oxygen and sunlight interact 
with hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen from both mobile and 
stationary sources. 
A critical part of this problem is the formation of ozone 
both in and downwind of large urban areas. Under certain weather 
conditions, the combination of NO

X

 and HC can result in urban and 
rural areas exceeding the national ambient ozone standard by a 
factor of three. The ozone NAAQS represents the maximum level 
considered protective of public health by the EPA.

Ozone is a powerful oxidant causing lung damage and reduced 
respiratory function after relatively short periods of exposure 
(approximately one hour). The oxidizing effect of ozone can 
irritate the nose, mouth, and throat causing coughing, choking, 
and eye irritation. In addition, ozone can also impair lung 
function and subsequently reduce the respiratory system's 
resistance to disease, including bronchial infections such as 
pneumonia. 
Elevated ozone levels can also cause aggravation of 
pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma.
 Ozone can 
cause a reduction in performance during exercise even in healthy 
persons. In addition, ozone can also cause alterations in 
pulmonary and extrapulmonary (nervous system, blood, liver, 
endocrine) function. 





The current NAAQS for ozone of 0.12 part per million (ppm) 
is set at a level that, with an adequate margin of safety, is 
protective of public health. However, ozone has also been shown 
to damage forests and crops, watershed areas, and marine life.
 
The NAAQS for ozone is frequently violated across large areas in 
the United States, and after 20 years of efforts aimed at 
reducing ozone-forming pollutants, although EPA has reported a 
trend toward lower average ozone concentrations from 1982 to 
1989,
 the ozone standard has proven to be exceptionally 
difficult to achieve. High levels of ozone have been recorded 
even in relatively remote areas, since ozone and its precursors 
can travel hundreds of miles and persist for several days in the 
lower atmosphere. Ozone damage to plants, including both natural 
forest ecosystems and crops, occurs at ozone levels between 0.06 
and 0.12 ppm.
 Repeated exposure to ozone levels above 0.04 
ppm can cause reductions in the yields of some crops above ten 
percent.
 While strains of some crops are relatively resistant 
to ozone, many crops experience a loss in yield of 30 percent at 
ozone concentrations below the NAAQS.
 The value of crops lost 
to ozone damage, while difficult to estimate precisely, is on the 
order of $2 billion per year in the United States.
 The effect 
of ozone on complex ecosystems such as forests is even more 
difficult to quantify. However, there is evidence that some 
forest types are negatively affected by ambient levels of 
ozone.
 Specifically, in the San Bernadino Mountains of 
southern California, ozone is believed to be the agent 
responsible for the slow decline and death of ponderosa pine 
trees in these forests since 1962.













Finally, by trapping energy radiated from the earth, 
tropospheric ozone may contribute to heating of the earth's 
surface, thereby contributing to global warming (that is, the 
greenhouse effect,
 although tropospheric ozone is also known 
to reduce levels of UVB radiation reaching the earth's surface, 
the increase of which is expected to result from depletion of 
stratospheric ozone.
 






VII. Technology Assessment 


In the draft RSD, EPA presents a comprehensive technology 
assessment supporting the emission standards proposed for each 
class of engines in this notice. This assessment demonstrates 
that small SI engine manufacturers will be technically capable of 
achieving the proposed emission standards and will not be capable 
of achieving lower emission standards in this Phase 1 rule. This 
assessment also considers factors of noise, energy, and safety as 
outlined in section 213(a)(3) of the CAA. The public docket for 
this rulemaking contains a lengthier version of this Technology 
Assessment section.

<TEXT>
 

The levels of the proposed emission standards under this 
rule are in large part driven by the aggressive timeline of Phase 
1. EPA agreed to promulgate Phase 1 small SI engine standards to 
realize early emission reduction benefits while a more 
comprehensive long-term program will be developed for Phase 2. 


A. Achievability of Proposed Emission Standards 


EPA believes that the proposed Phase l emission standards 
are the lowest standards for Class I-V engines achievable by the 
1996 model year. 
The engines covered by this proposed regulation are divided 
into five classes with unique emission standards proposed for 
each class. The lowest level of emission standards achievable 
was determined for each class of engines. The unique standards 
for each class are driven by differences in emission reduction 
capability of engines with different combustion cycles and 
different displacements. 
Class I and II engines represent nonhandheld engines that, 
in large part, use 4-stroke combustion cycle engines, as opposed 
to Class III-V engines which represent handheld engines that, in 
large part, use 2-stroke combustion cycle engines. Within the 
time constraints for compliance with this rule, Class I and II 
engines will be capable of achieving a lower HC + NO

X

 composite 
emission standard and lower CO emission standard than the Class 
III-V engines are capable of achieving. Furthermore, within each 
combustion cycle type, the larger displacement classes will be 
capable of achieving lower HC + NO

X

, HC, and CO emission 
standards. A full discussion of the technical rationale for 
these limitations is set forth in the draft RSD. 
EPA's belief that the proposed emission standards for 
Classes I-V are the lowest achievable standards is based on 
emission data provided on nonoptimized prototype configurations 
of engines that meet the proposed standards, technical 
discussions with manufacturers, and EPA analysis of information 
on technologies collected from a range of sources. The following 
is a summary of these analyses. A complete analysis is provided 
in the draft RSD. 
EPA has compiled emission data on selected Class I-V engines 
and prototypes that were tested at either an independent or 
industry laboratory and met the proposed emission standards. 
These prototypes represent the greatest degree of emission 
control technology achievable given the aggressive timeline for 
earliest possible introduction of these engines into commerce at 
reasonable cost (one of the parameters for achievability listed 
in CAA section 213(a)(3)). Data was compiled and reported on 
three Class I engines, two Class II engines, one Class III 
engine, two Class IV engines plus one data point representing the 
aggregate of 27 Class IV engines, and one Class V engine plus one 
data point representing the aggregate of 18 Class V engines. 
These data and the specific technologies used on each are 
presented in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD. 
Additional support for the proposed emission standards being 
the lowest achievable standards is provided by EPA's analytical 
summary of confidential discussions with manufacturers and 
information on technologies collected from a range of sources. 
EPA used this summary information to compile and predict the 
expected percentage usage of each emission control technology 
discussed. 
For Class I and II engines, EPA predicts that manufacturers 
will use different combinations of the following technologies: 
Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications; fuel system 
modifications; ignition timing modifications; valve system and 
valve timing modifications; combustion chamber modifications; 
cooling system modifications; some conversion from side valve to 
overhead valve engines; and some conversion from 2-stroke to 4- 
stroke engines. 
For Class III, IV, and V engines, EPA predicts that 
manufacturers will use combinations of the following 
technologies: Carburetor enleanment and/or modifications; 
carburetor limiter cap installation; fuel system modifications; 
combustion chamber modifications; port timing and scavenging 
modifications; cooling system modifications; and some conversion 
from 2-stroke to 4-stroke engines. The estimated percent usage 
of each technology by engine class is presented and discussed in 
the draft RSD. 
In addition to the technologies listed, the use of catalytic 
converters, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and air injection 
technology may occur on a limited basis or not at all in the 1996 
model year. EPA estimates that manufacturers will meet proposed 
Phase 1 emission standards without the use of catalysts. However, 
some manufacturers are developing low efficiency catalysts in 
case some marginally acceptable engine family should need this 
technology to meet the standards. If catalysts were to be used, 
EPA estimates that their use would occur on no more than 30 
percent of Class I engines and one percent of all Class II-V 
engines. EPA requests information on the likelihood that 
catalyst, EGR, or air injection systems will be used and, if so, 
any additional information on percent usage. 


B. Proposed Emission Standards Are Lowest Feasible 


EPA believes that three specific emission control 
technologies, while allowing engines to meet lower standards than 
those proposed today, cannot be developed within the timeline of 
this rule or at reasonable cost. Technologies such as high 
efficiency catalytic converters, low cost fuel injection systems, 
and low cost electronic control systems are currently either 
available on only a limited basis or are in the early design 
phase. These technologies cannot be used on the vast majority of 
engines by the proposed implementation date. These technologies 
have the potential to develop much greater emission reductions 
than those technologies determined to be achievable for this 
rule. As discussed in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, a number of 
technical barriers and safety issues must still be overcome 
before standards can be set that would reflect general or blanket 
use of these technologies.

C. Impact on Equipment 



EPA estimates that the proposed emission standards can be 
met with the identified engine emission control technologies with 
minimal impact on equipment design. However, EPA also believes 
that to propose more stringent emission standards in today's rule 
than those already proposed would necessitate equipment redesign 
to accommodate more sophisticated technologies, such as high 
efficiency catalysts. 

It has been EPA's past experience that, given the latitude 
to change either the engine or equipment, most manufacturers will 
choose to modify the engine. EPA estimates that most engine 
models will require only internal modifications (such as tighter 
tolerances and fuel mixture enleanment strategies) to meet the 
proposed standards. These modifications will have little, if 
any, effect on equipment design. 

EPA estimates that few engine models will be discontinued as 
a result of the proposed standards. Models that may be 
discontinued represent older engine designs and low volume sales. 
Since this market generally has a large number of engine models, 
substitutions should be readily available for these few incidents 
of model discontinuation. 

Catalytic converter use is not predicted for the Phase 1 
rule. However, if catalysts should be used on a small percentage 
of equipment, EPA has estimated the equipment impact of catalyst 
use in terms of additional shielding as a result of higher 
exhaust skin temperatures. 

The draft RSD summarizes EPA's estimates of equipment 
impacts as a result of this rulemaking. EPA requests comment or 
additional information with respect to the estimations concerning 
impact of the proposed standards on equipment. 



D. Energy, Noise, and Safety 



Section 213(a)(3) of the Act requires that EPA also give 
appropriate consideration to energy, noise, and safety factors 
associated with the application of technologies. Energy factors 
include engine fuel consumption and power. Noise factors are 
self explanatory, and safety factors include safety for the user 
as well as compliance with other existing regulations in this 
country and abroad. 

In Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA has analyzed the likely 
average fuel consumption change considering all factors that 
would impact the final figure in actual use. EPA estimates that 
a reduction in fuel consumption is likely to be seen in actual 
use and will average approximately 13 percent for handheld 
engines and 26 percent for nonhandheld engines. Since this is a 
desirable impact, little additional design effort will be 
expended to optimize fuel consumption effects. 

Manufacturers will also optimize final designs such that the 
expected power loss on resulting production engines will be 
minimized. Based on analyses in Chapter 1 of the draft RSD, EPA 
estimates that the resulting average power change in actual use 
will be a gain of approximately five percent for Class I and II 
engines and a three percent reduction for Class III-V engines. 
The major contributors to this gain for Class I and II are 
changes in technology for Class I side valve engines which make 
up a large majority of engines in this rulemaking. 

Although overall power may increase, some engines may 
experience a decrease in power availability. However, real time 
data collected on equipment in actual use demonstrate that many 
engines do not need their full power capability in actual use. 
This is especially true in the case of nonhandheld engines. The 
operators of these engines will likely experience no performance 
impact as a result of this rule. 

Engine noise level is expected to stay at current levels. 
Further discussion of this issue can be found in ``V.O. Cap on 
Noise.'' 

Many safety regulations and recommendations have been 
established for small engines and their related use in equipment. 
These regulations will affect the feasibility of using some 
technologies on handheld engines. One example is a regulation 
requiring spark arresters on equipment used on certain federal 
lands. See 36 CFR part 261. The regulation results in a temperature 
limit on exhaust and exhaust surfaces which, to date, has 
resulted in a limitation on the feasibility of the use of 
catalysts for handheld engines due to the high heat levels 
emitted during conversion of pollutants as seen when applied to 
these engines. 

Safety recommendations and regulations also have an impact 
on the end use of the engines. Some small SI equipment have 
operating restrictions of certain speeds and loads. One example 
is ANSI standard B71.1 which contains information for measuring 
mower blade tip speed and a description of the use of safety 
brake systems. A summary of safety regulations and 
recommendations is presented in the draft RSD. EPA requests 
further information on additional safety regulations or 
requirements which may impact engines covered by this rulemaking. 



E. Per Engine Cost Estimates Due to Proposed Standards 



The technical solutions required to meet the emission 
standards proposed in this notice will be cost-effective. 
Further discussion is presented in ``IX. Cost-Effectiveness.'' 
While this summary presents only aggregate costs for nonhandheld 
and handheld engines, the draft RSD gives cost estimates by 
technology and by engine displacement class. 

The retail price of equipment which uses nonhandheld engines 
ranges from $90 to $9,000. On average, the cost to the engine 
manufacturer to install the necessary emission control technology 
on these engines will be approximately $0.80 to $1.13 per engine. 
The retail price of equipment which uses handheld engines ranges 
from $60 to $1,000. On average, the cost to install the 
necessary control technology on all handheld equipment engines, 
hardware variable costs, and production costs will be 
approximately $2.05 to $2.20 per engine to the engine 
manufacturer. Tables in the draft RSD list the Agency's 
estimated variable hardware and production cost broken out by 
engine technology for each engine class.

<TEXT>
 

EPA's cost estimate assumes that catalytic converters will not be needed to comply with proposed standards. However,
as discussed previously, engine manufacturers may voluntarily decide to use catalysts on a percentage of engines
at risk of only marginally complying. Should catalysts actually be used, EPA estimates that the additional variable
hardware costs for nonhandheld engines will be $1.09 per engine and for handheld engine will be $0.10 per engine, with
an additional $0.24 per engine for equipment modifications and $0.20 per potential heat shielding. The Agency requests
additional comment on these cost estimates for application of catalyst technology and equipment impacts. 



VIII. Economic Effects 



The total national average annual cost of this rule is 
estimated to be $55 million. If catalysts become necessary, the 
average annual cost estimate becomes $73 million. 

EPA's economic analysis of the proposed rule's likely impact 
on consumers and industry indicates that reducing pollution from 
these engines will result in offsetting costs to consumers. 
Consumers will find small increases in retail prices for most 
equipment powered by these engines. The initial purchase price 
to the consumer will, however, be partially offset by savings in 
fuel and maintenance costs. Thus, over time, environmentally 
friendly, alternatively powered equipment such as electric 
powered trimmers, chain saws, and lawnmowers will become less 
costly to consumers. Industry will bear pollution control costs 
that are moderate (roughly six percent for handheld and two 
percent for nonhandheld equipment) relative to current production 
costs. (The level of pollution control costs is largely due to 
the high levels of pollution emitted by these engines, especially 
2-stroke engines, and the relatively outdated state of the 
technology compared to on-highway engines.) However, the costs 
are small in absolute terms, and it is anticipated that these 
costs will be passed through to consumers in higher product 
prices. The complete economic analysis can be found in Chapter 3 
of the draft RSD. 



A. Consumer Cost 



EPA estimated the increase in consumer cost of the equipment 
powered by these engines. In assessing consumer cost, three 
areas were analyzed: change to the retail cost of the engine, 
cost of fuel, and cost of maintenance. 



1. Retail Cost 



The increase in retail price of the equipment to the 
consumer is estimated using a percentage increase over the 
average amortized and discounted per engine manufacturers' cost, 
weighted by the sales mix. As such, the estimated sales-weighted 
average increase in retail cost to the consumer due to the 
proposed rule in 1996 is $4.04 for handheld equipment and $2.35 
for nonhandheld equipment. If catalysts are necessary, the 
estimated sales-weighted average increase in retail cost to the 
consumer due to the proposed rule in 1996 is $4.30 for handheld 
equipment and $3.68 for nonhandheld equipment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-1-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The retail price effects for specific engines may be more or less than the costs shown here, depending on the specific
technology of the engine. However, the price increases shown here reflect the relative price increases considering
all types of engines in the market. Therefore, these estimates are not indicative of the price increase specific to
any particular manufacturer's engine or equipment. 



2. Fuel Cost 



This rule is expected to decrease fuel consumption significantly. The average sales-weighted handheld engine is
expected to experience a 13 percent decrease in fuel consumption and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld engine
is expected to experience a 26 percent decrease in fuel consumption. However, these decreases are translated into
small discounted lifetime sales-weighted fuel savings of approximately $0.22 for a handheld engine and $2.79 for
a nonhandheld engine. 



3. Maintenance Cost 



EPA estimates that the engines produced to meet the proposed emission standards will be higher quality: the parts
and raw materials will be more durable and less likely to malfunction. See Chapter 2 of the draft RSD for further discussion
of this phenomenon. This will result in equipment which is operational a higher percentage of the time and which lasts
longer. EPA is unable to estimate the increase in useful life or the decrease in maintenance costs at this time. EPA
requests comment on the potential decrease in maintenance costs and potential increase in useful life. 



4. Lifetime Consumer Cost Impact 



The lifetime consumer cost impact was assessed by considering the decrease in maintenance cost and the fuel savings
along with the increase in retail price of the average, sales- weighted engine. The increase in price of an engine will
be mitigated somewhat by these other impacts. Applying the lifetime savings in fuel costs, the average sales-weighted
handheld engine's lifetime increase in cost will be adjusted to $3.82 and the average sales-weighted nonhandheld
engine's lifetime cost impact will be a savings of $0.44. If catalysts are necessary this will be $4.08 for a handheld
engine and $.89 for a nonhandheld engine. EPA requests comments on lifetime consumer costs. Submission of quantified
estimates would be beneficial. 



B. Incremental Economic Impacts 



EPA considered the potential incremental economic impacts due to today's proposal. EPA estimates the net present
value of pollution control capital costs to be approximately $27 million. EPA estimates that there will be no long
run negative impacts on employment as a result of this rule. Costs can be recovered through increased prices. Any potential
decreases in employment that might occur due to obsolescence of product line should be offset by increased production
of engines meeting emission standards. Total demand for these products has traditionally been relatively inelastic,
and thus industry sales volume is not expected to decrease. Energy impacts will be positive, freeing up approximately
$9 million for other uses in the economy. 



IX. Cost-Effectiveness 



Based upon the costs and benefits in the previous discussion, EPA has prepared a cost-effectiveness analysis and
has performed a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this proposal. See ``X.A. Administrative Requirements'' for
an explanation of the mandate for an RIA. Because the benefits of this proposal are not easily monetized, a cost-effectiveness
analysis has been prepared. The complete RIA is contained in the draft RSD. Presented here is a summary of the cost-effectiveness
of the proposed small SI engine Phase 1 program. 

If all program costs are allocated to HC reductions, today's proposal has a cost-effectiveness of $197 per ton of HC
reduced. Alternatively, if all program costs are allocated to CO reductions, the cost-effectiveness would be $37
per ton. 

If the costs of the program were equally split between HC and CO, the cost-effectiveness of HC reduction would be $99
per ton and the cost-effectiveness of CO would be $19 per ton. 

These cost-effectiveness numbers are significantly lower than costs per ton of other available control strategies.
The cost-effectiveness estimates, underlying quantitative methodology, and comparisons to other available control
strategies discussed above are explained further in the draft RSD/RIA. 

In summary, the cost-effectiveness of the standard included in the current proposal is favorable relative to the
cost- effectiveness of several other control measures required under the Clean Air Act. To the extent that cost-effective
nationwide controls are applied to small SI engines, the need may be reduced to apply in the future more expensive additional
controls to mobile and stationary sources that also contribute to ozone nonattainment, nutrient loading, and visibility.




X. Administrative Requirements 



A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis 



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 

Federal Register

 51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore
subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact
of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in the Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because this rulemaking adversely affects in a material way a sector of the economy, namely manufacturers
of small SI engines, particularly the manufacturers who specialize in the production of small handheld engines.
Further, EPA believes that an RIA is important for this rule because small SI engines have not previously been regulated.
As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations
will be documented in the public record. 



B. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Copies of the ICR document may be obtained
from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW (PM-223Y), Washington, DC 20460 or by calling
(202) 260-2740. 

Table 4 provides a listing of this proposed rulemaking's information collection requirements along with the appropriate
information collection request (ICR) numbers. The cost of this burden has been incorporated into the cost estimate
for this rule. 

EPA has estimated that the public reporting burden for the collection of information required under this proposed
rule would average approximately 6,100 hours annually for a typical engine manufacturer. The hours spent by a manufacturer
on information collection activities in any given year would be highly dependent upon manufacturer specific variables,
such as the number of engine families, production changes, emission defects, etc. 








Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW (PM-223Y), Washington,
DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC
20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will contain response to OMB or public comments
on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.

C. Impact on Small Entities 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts of federal
regulations upon small entities. In instances where significant impacts are possible on a substantial number of
these entities, agencies are required to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA). The RFA explores options
for minimizing those impacts. 

EPA has recently adopted a new approach to regulatory flexibility
 for purposes of EPA's implementation of the Act, any impact is a significant impact, and any number of small entities
is a substantial number. Thus, EPA will consider regulatory options for every regulation subject to the Act that can
reasonably be expected to have an impact on small entities. 





Therefore, in light of this new approach, EPA has determined that this rule will have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities. As a result, EPA has tailored this rule to minimize the cost burdens imposed on smaller engine
manufacturers. 

The proposed regulations contain certification requirements for new engines, in-use testing requirements for
controlled engines, Selective Enforcement Auditing provisions for the testing of production engines, and prohibitions
on incorrect engine use for equipment manufacturers. 

The certification program has been structured in this proposal such that all manufacturers may take advantage of
a more simplified certification process than that currently mandated in the on-highway program. Testing requirements
for test engines are reduced. The application and certification process is more straightforward. 

The in-use testing program is structured such that manufacturers with lower annual production volumes have a lower
minimum number of engines which must be tested. This places the burden of the in-use testing mostly on manufacturers
with high production volumes. Provisions are also allowed for manufacturers whose number of product lines are limited.
Also, manufacturers with very low production volumes are allowed maximum flexibility in procuring engines to be
tested. Refer to ``IV.C.10. In-use Testing Program'' for a more detailed discussion. 

The SEA program is structured such that the annual limit on the number of SEA's that EPA may perform is lower for manufacturers
with lower projected annual production. Additionally, manufacturers with high projected annual production but
fewer engine families will have a lower annual limit. Furthermore, manufacturers with low projected annual production
may perform fewer audit tests per day to minimize the SEA burden on its test facilities. Refer to ``IV.C.19. Selective
Enforcement Auditing Program'' for a more detailed discussion. 

EPA is proposing that equipment manufacturers must correctly use engines that are certified upon implementation
of these regulations. However, EPA has decided to make the use of non- certified engines for United States-marketed
equipment a prohibited act rather than requiring equipment manufacturers to report to EPA that they are using certified
engines in their equipment being consumed in the United States. Further, it is a prohibited act for equipment manufacturers
to incorrectly use an engine certified as handheld in nonhandheld equipment marketed in the United States. EPA decided
to make these provisions prohibited acts in order to reduce any potential reporting or recordkeeping burden for engine
and equipment manufacturers. Manufacturers who attempt to sell equipment to the United States market which uses
noncertified engines or uses handheld engines in nonhandheld equipment will be voluntarily reported to EPA by their
competitors. EPA has proposed stiff fines on prohibited acts. Competition should effectively police these prohibited
acts as competitors have a competitive incentive to make sure that no equipment manufacturer is dumping equipment
with lower cost, unlawful, noncertified, or incorrectly used engines (that is, the use of a handheld engine in nonhandheld
equipment) into the U.S. market. 

EPA considered, but rejected, the notion of exempting small manufacturers from enforcement programs or from the
regulation entirely. A more proportionate sharing of cost burden was deemed appropriate. The pollution emitted
by each of these engines not only contributes to ambient air quality problems but also has health impacts on the user
of the equipment who is in close proximity to the exhaust emissions. See ``VI. Environmental Benefit Assessment''
for a discussion of the health impacts of the related exhaust pollutants.

Pesticide Tolerances for 1-[(6-Chloro-3-Pyridinyl)Methyl]-N-Nitro-2-Imidazolidinimine 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to establish time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-

N

-nitro-2-imidazolidinimine and its metabolites (proposed common name ``imidacloprid'') in or on dried hops at
3.0 parts per million (ppm), milk at 0.05 ppm, and meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and
sheep at 0.2 ppm, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective date of a final rule based on this
proposal. EPA is issuing this proposal on its own initiative. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C.
346a(e), EPA is proposing a time-limited tolerance for the residues of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per
million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as raw agricultural commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59
FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is proposing the tolerance because EPA has granted a petition for an emergency exemption
under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid
on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid is used in other countries that export hops to
the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete. The most significant data gap for establishing
a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue trial. Given the relatively low risks
presented by imidacloprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will significantly change EPA's risk assessment.
Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this tolerance for a full residue data base to be available
in making a decision on a permanent tolerance.


All relevant materials have been evaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance include:
1. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 ppm (8 mg/kg/bwt); rat
and rabbit teratology studies were negative at doses up to 30 mg/kg/bwt and 24 mg/kg/bwt, respectively.
2. A 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of
the study and had a NOEL of 100 ppm (5.7 mg/kg/bwt in male and 7.6 mg/kg/bwt female) for noncarcinogenic effects that
included decreased body weight gain in females at 300 ppm and increased thyroid lesions in males at 300 ppm and females
at 900 ppm..
3. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1,250 ppm (41/mg/kg/bwt).
4. A 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study that was negative for carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
and that had a NOEL of 1,000 ppm (208 mg/kg/day).
There is no cancer risk associated with exposure to this chemical. Imidacloprid has been classified as a ``Group E''
(no evidence of carcinogenicity for humans) carcinogen by the OPP Reference Dose (RfD) Committee.
The reference dose (RfD), based on the 2-year rat feeding/carcinogenic study with a NOEL of 5.7 mg/kg/bwt and 100-fold
uncertainity factor, is calculated to be 0.057 mg/kg/bwt. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC)
from the proposed tolerances is 0.000984 mg/kg/bwt/day and utilizes 2 percent percent of the ADI.

The nature of the residue in plants and livestock is adequately understood. Results of a bovine feeding study show
that finite imidacloprid residues will actually occur in milk, meat, fat, and meat by-products of cattle, goats,
hogs, horses, and sheep from feeding of imidacloprid-treated raw agricultural commodities or their processed commodities
when the formulations are used as directed; therefore, tolerances are required. Spent hops are not considered a poultry
feed item; therefore, secondary imidacloprid tolerances for poultry and eggs are not required. The analytical method
is a common moiety method for imidacloprid and its metabolites containing the 6-chloropyridiyl moiety in plants
using a permanganate oxidation, silyl derivatization, and capillary GC-MS selective ion monitoring. The magnitude
of the residue crop field trial data for imidacloprid on hops indicate that residues of total imidacloprid will not
exceed the proposed tolerance when the formulations are used as directed.
The tolerance would be established for 1 year, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective
date of a final rule based on this proposal.
This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the above information
considered by the Agency, the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 would protect the public health.
Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerances be established as set forth below.
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under FIFRA, as amended,
which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request within 30 days after publication of this document
in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with FFDCA section 408(e).
Interested person are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear notation
indicating the document control number, [OPP-300343]. All written comments filed in response to this document will
be be available in the Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section, at the addressed given above from 8 a.m. to
4 p.m, Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement of this effect
was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 9181 (46 FR 24950).

Further Forbearance From Title II Regulation for Certain Types of Commercial Mobile Radio Service Providers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rule making.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice of proposed rule making (Notice) solicits comment on whether, within particular services classified
as Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS), there may be types of providers that merit forbearance from certain requirements
found in Title II of the Communications Act. Specifically, the Commission asks whether we should forbear from enforcing
those provisions of Title II that we determined did not merit general forbearance in our Second Report and Order in
Gen. Docket No. 93-252. If the further forbearance is warranted, the Commission asks how we should determine
which types of CMRS providers should be excused from remaining Title II requirements and how we should implement and
enforce such forbearance provisions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice in GN Docket No. 94-33, adopted April 20, 1994 and released May 4,
1994. The full text of Commission decisions are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours
in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may also
be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., (202) 857-3800,
2100 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037.





Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 



1. In the Second Report and Order in General Docket No. 93-252, 59 FR 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) the Commission elected,
pursuant to the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act), to forbear from applying Sections 203, 204,
205, 211, 212, and 214 of Title II of the Communications Act to any service classified as CMRS. The Commission determined
that the remaining sections of Title II should be enforced with respect to CMRS providers in order to promote competition
or to protect consumers, and that this decision would not place any undue burden on any CMRS provider or class of providers.
Nevertheless, the Commission also announced that it would consider additional relief in a future rule making that
would gather a more extensive record on the potential effect of the remaining sections of Title II on particular types
of CMRS providers within each class of service. The purpose of this Notice is to initiate that rule making.

2. The Budget Act authorizes the Commission to take forbearance actions if it determines that: (i) Enforcement of
such provision is not necessary in order to ensure that the charges, practice, classifications, or regulations for
or in connection with that service are just and reasonable and are not unjustly discriminatory; (ii) enforcement
of such provision is not necessary for the protection of consumers; and (iii) specifying such provision is consistent
with the public interest. The legislative history of this provision indicates that the Commission may distinguish
among types of CMRS providers in making this determination. Assuming that further forbearance in a particular case
would not adversely affect rates or practices or harm consumers under the first two prongs of the test, the Commission
tentatively identified two factors under the public interest test of the last prong that could serve to guide its determinations:
(1) Whether there are differential costs of compliance with the remaining Title II sections that could make further
forbearance appropriate for particular types of providers; and (2) whether the public interest benefits from application
of particular Title II provisions are less for certain types of CMRS providers. Thus, in applying the last prong of
the statutory test, the Commission asks commenters to identify (1) the benefits of applying the remaining Title II
sections, (2) the costs of compliance with any the remaining Title II sections, and (3) whether the costs of compliance
with any of the remaining sections of Title II outweigh the benefits. In addition, the Commission asks, pursuant to
47 CFR 332(c)(1)(C), whether further forbearance will enhance future CMRS competition from a diversity of entities.

3. The Commission also asks commenters to demonstrate actual or projected costs of compliance with each provision
of Title II that was not forborne, and the extent to which such costs vary across different types of providers. For example,
if the costs of regulation are fixed, it could indicate that small CMRS providers are more likely than other types of
CMRS providers to be burdened by the costs of regulation. The Commission asks whether there are instances where these
additional costs outweigh the public interest benefits of applying the statutory provision in issue. The Commission
seeks evidence on the magnitude of any such fixed costs.



I. Application of Further Forbearance



4. Commenters should address (1) how the statutory forbearance test applies to each remaining Title II provision,
(2) how further forbearance from applying each provision of Title II would enhance future CMRS competition, (3) how
Congressional intent underlying each Title II provision would be affected, (4) how forbearance for particular types
of CMRS providers would comport with regulatory symmetry and (5) whether there are other factors or alternatives
we should consider in classifying CMRS for further forbearance.

5. The Commission seeks comment on its tentative view that there would be no purpose in forbearing from applying 47
U.S.C. 210, which allows common carriers to issue franks and passes to their employees, and to provide the Government
with free service in connection with preparation for national defense.

6. The Commission characterized 47 U.S.C. 213, 215, 218, 219, and 220 as primarily reservations of authority and reaffirmed
its finding in the Second Report and Order that it was unnecessary to forbear from applying these provisions to CMRS.
Section 213 authorizes the Commission to make valuations of carrier property. Section 215 gives the Commission the
authority to examine carrier activities and transactions. Section 218 authorizes the Commission to inquire into
the management of a carrier and its owner. Section 219, 

inter alia, 

authorizes the Commission to require annual reports from carriers. Section 220 gives the Commission discretion
to prescribe the forms of accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by carriers, as well as depreciation rates. Even
though these provisions impose no affirmative obligations on CMRS providers, and may have no immediate impact on
CMRS, the Commission seeks comment on whether the potential for increased regulation (and any concomitant costs)
might have an adverse economic impact on specific types of provides that is not in the public interest.

7. 47 CFR 223 governs obscene, harassing and indecent communications. In relevant part, the statute forbids a common
carrier (if the carrier collects payments for an adult information provider using the carrier's services) to the
extent technically feasible, to permit access to an obscene or indecent communication from the telephone of any subscriber
who has not previously requested such access. This requirement, known as ``reverse blocking,'' applies only if a
carrier bills and collects fees for the adult information provider. As a technical matter, then, a CMRS provider subject
to this obligation would have to program its switch (should it employ one) to accomplish this blocking.

8. The Commission tentatively reaffirms its general conclusion in the Second Report and Order that section 223 should
continue to apply to CMRS. Commenters are asked to address the impact of section 223 on existing and projected CMRS
offerings, and in particular, whether CMRS providers are likely to be involved in services that implicate Section
223.

9. 47 U.S.C. 225, Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act, requires all common carriers providing interstate
or intrastate telephone voice transmission service to provide telecommunications services that enable persons
with hearing and speech disabilities to communicate with hearing individuals. Common carriers may select one of
several methods of offering TRS, but most have elected to designate a TRS provider or to provide TRS in concert with
other carriers.

<TEXT>
 

10. For purposes of further forbearance, the Commission asks whether there are any CMRS providers whose market is
so specialized, or their customer base or size of operation so small that applying TRS obligations to them would not
appreciably advance the universal service objectives of Section 225. Would forbearance in such cases meet the test
in section 332? Parties are also asked to address whether the need for forbearance is reduced by providers' ability
to designate a third party to provide TRS. The Commission also seeks comment on whether there are technical or operational
limitations that would make compliance with our TRS technical standards difficult for a particular type of CMRS provider.
The Commission asks whether interfacing with a third-party TRS provider would also pose technical difficulties,
particularly for those private providers who will be reclassified as CMRS after new technical/operational rules
become effective.

11. The Commission has adopted a shared-funding mechanism for interstate TRS cost recovery. Under the Commission's
shared-funding plan, providers of interstate telecommunications services are required to contribute to a TRS fund
and comply with reporting and filing obligations, including conforming their accounts to a specified format. The
amount of the yearly contribution is a percentage (.00030) of the carrier's gross interstate revenues. Each carrier
must contribute at least $100, even if its share under the actual computation would be less.

12. In light of the small percentage used to calculate the contribution and the low minimum required, the Commission
asks whether the burden from the funding and concomitant filing obligations are likely to be significant for any type
of CMRS. The Commission also reiterates that providers that do not themselves use TRS facilities are nevertheless
required to contribute to the Fund. The Commission seeks comment on its tentative view that the public interest would
not be furthered by exempting CMRS entirely because they do not use TRS facilities.

13. The Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act (TOCSIA), codified at 47 U.S.C. 226, protects consumers
making interstate operator service calls from phones available to the public or to transient users against unreasonably
high rates and anti-competitive practices. It regulates two groups. The first consists of operator service providers
(OSPs). These are providers of interstate telecommunications service from phones available to the public or to transient
users that give automatic or live assistance for billing or completion to a caller. The second group are aggregators,
generally persons that, in the ordinary course of their operations, make telephones available to the public or to
transient users of the premises and who use a provider of operator services. Pursuant to TOCSIA and Commission rules,
OSPs are subject to various identification, disclosure and billing requirements, including the requirement that
they ``brand'' calls, 

i.e., 

audibly identify themselves at the beginning of the call and before the consumer incurs any charges for the call. They
may not engage in ``call splashing'' (transfer of a call to another carrier at a location different from the originating
consumer where the second carrier cannot tell the originating location, with the result that the charge to the consumer
is incorrect and not based on originating location). OSPs must file informational tariffs. Aggregators are required
to identify and disclose certain information regarding the presubscribed OSP and to disclose that rate information
is available and that the consumer has the right to use an OSP of his or her choice. The aggregator must also ensure (1)
that its telephones presubscribed to an OSP allow consumers to use 800 or 900 numbers to obtain access to the OSP of choice,
and (2) according to an established implementation schedule, that any of its presubscribed equipment allows the
consumer to use equal access (10XXX) codes to access the customer's choice of OSP.

14. The Notice requests comment on whether forbearance from section 226 for particular classes of CMRS would be justified.
Parties advocating forbearance for specific types of providers from the aggregator or OSP rules should explain how
such action would meet the three-part test for forbearance under Section 332. In particular, parties should address
how the first and second prongs of the test, that rates be just and reasonable and that consumers be adequately protected,
would be met. In connection with the third prong, parties should address whether the statute imposes any costs that
would be exceptionally difficult for certain types of CMRS provider to bear, and whether forbearance in such case
would significantly diminish statutory protections for the public. In particular, the Commission seeks comment
on whether such costs are likely to prove unduly burdensome for specific types of small CMRS providers.

15. The telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), 47 U.S.C. 227, restricts the use of automatic telephone
dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, and telephone facsimile machines to send unsolicited
advertisements. TCPA prohibits autodialed and prerecorded voice message calls to emergency lines, health care
facilities or similar establishments, and with certain exceptions, number (such as cellular numbers) for which
the called party is charged for the call.

16. Current TCPA obligations primarily apply to the originator of the unwanted message, 

e.g.,

 telemarketers. Unless a CMRS provider also engages in telemarketing or sends unsolicited facsimiles or other unwanted
communications, the statute generally does not apply to it. In so far as small CMRS providers act as originators of
unsolicited voice or facsimile transmissions, the Commission tentatively concludes that forbearance for such
providers would not adequately protect consumers' privacy interests under the second prong of the Section 332 test.
Moreover, the decision to undertake telemarketing services would be a voluntary business judgment on the part of
a CMRS provider. Such telemarketing is not a necessary part of what is generally regarded as CMRS. The Commission also
sees no public interest benefit under the third prong of the test in permitting CMRS providers, even small ones, to
undertake such activities without complying with TCPA. The Notice seeks comment on these tentative views.

17. 47 U.S.C. 228 incorporates the Telephone Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act (TDDRA), which governs pay-per-call
services (also known as ``audiotext'' or ``900'' services), and imposes obligations in interexchange carriers,
local exchange carriers and common carriers in general. Pursuant to the Act and our implementing regulations, local
exchange carriers must offer subscribers, where technically feasible, an option to block access to 900 services.
They must also tariff the terms and conditions for such blocking.

18. TDDRA also imposes additional obligations on all common carriers. (a) 800 Service. With certain exceptions,
information service charges cannot be assessed against callers to 800 and other toll-free numbers. Common carriers
must enforce this obligation by contract or tariff. (b) Collect Calls. Common carriers may not transmit collect information
services that are either at a per-call or per-time-interval charge that is greater than, or in addition to, the charge
for the transmission of the call, or have not been affirmatively accepted by the called party. (c) Payment. Common
carriers are prohibited from disconnecting or interrupting service for failure to remit pay-per-call or similar
service charges. Common carriers may not recover the cost of complying with TDDRA requirements from ratepayers.

19. The Commission seeks comment on the extent to which the local exchange carrier obligation to permit subscribers
to block access where technically feasible should apply to CMRS, and whether there are particular types of CMRS providers
for which such an obligation would be particularly difficult. Would local exchange carriers provide blocking for
customers of CMRS providers that interconnect with the public switched network? Additional TDDRA obligations,
including restrictions on disconnection or on transmission of collect pay-per-call charges, are imposed on carriers
who bill and collect for 900 services, which is not a common carrier service. The Commission asks for comment on whether
this type of voluntary business activity is not essential to provision of CMRS and hence, would not justify forbearance
for any type of CMRS.

20. In analyzing application of any of the above TDDRA obligations, commenters are asked to address the three parts
of the section 332 forbearance test. In connection with the third prong, the Commission asks whether Section 228 obligations
would impose exceptional costs on certain types of CMRS and whether forbearance in such cases would significantly
diminish statutory protections to the public. Parties should also address the effect forbearance would have on the
TDDRA objectives of promoting the legitimate development of pay-per-call services and protecting consumers from
fraudulent and deceptive practices.



II. CMRS Providers Meriting Further Forbearance



21. Turning to the question of which types of CMRS providers merit further forbearance, the Commission asks as a threshold
matter whether any further forbearance is merited, noting that application of Title II is not expected to create any
undue burden on any CMRS provider, or on CMRS competition generally. To the extent that regulatory obligations impose
fixed costs, however, they would place relatively greater burdens on small providers who have less of a revenue base
and other resources to support them. The Commission seeks comment on whether there are technical or operational limitations
inherent in the services these small businesses provide that may make application of certain of the statutory provisions
in question not in the public interest. The Commission also recognizes the public interest in maintaining opportunities
for small businesses and the role that further forbearance might play in reducing the cost of doing business for them.
The Notice thus seeks comment on whether the size of the provider may be a basis for defining CMRS eligibility for further
forbearance. Finally, the Notice seeks comment on whether to consider an analysis of a CMRS provider's customer base
as another possible factor in determining the appropriateness of further forbearance. Certain types of providers,
particularly small providers, may serve predominantly business customers who require more advanced communications
services and may have relatively greater bargaining power than CMRS customers that make personal use of the service.
As a result the differing needs of business and individual customers could affect the analysis of whether forbearance
would reduce benefits to customers. In addition, the Commission asks whether it should distinguish between medium
to large business customers, and small businesses.

22. The Commission seeks comment on how to determine which type of provider should be considered ``small'' for purposes
of further forbearance. The Commission asks interested parties to comment on whether any one or any combination of
the options advanced below should be applied. Parties are invited to identify alternatives and to comment on how the
Commission could draw on its experience in identifying small carriers in other contexts, 

e.g.

, the exemption to the cable-telco cross-ownership rule. Finally, the Notice asks interested parties to provide
their views on how the Commission might best implement and enforce any classification scheme. The Notice seeks comment
on the advantages and disadvantages of the various options with respect to implementation by both the Commission
and licensees. 



A. Measurement Factors 


23. One possible standard for size of business operation is the Small Business Administration (SBA) definition of
small entity: an entity with a net worth not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes
for the two preceding years not in excess of $2 million. The Commission relied on this standard to define small businesses
entitled to preferences under the spectrum auction rules. The Commission believes that these criteria are appropriate
for identifying entities entitled to preferred entry into new business ventures, as in the spectrum auction context.
The Commission tentatively finds, however, that this standard is too generous for purposes of determining which
CMRS providers are entitled to relief from remaining title II obligations, many of which, as discussed above, are
designed to protect consumers. The Notice thus asks whether the Commission should employ a more modest income and
net worth standard. Those commenters that nevertheless advocate use of this approach should discuss how it would
affect the different services comprising CMRS, providing as much data as possible on the number of providers in a particular
service that would be eligible for further forbearance under this definition, and how it would affect consumer protection.
