<DOCTITLE>Savant Sage Resource Area; Idaho Panhandle National Forests, Kootenai County, Idaho.</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement for activities in the Savant Sage Resource Area.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The notice is hereby given that the Forest Service has prepared a Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) documenting
activities in the Savant Sage Resource Area. The area is located approximately 5 miles east of Athol, Idaho, and is
approximately 7,500 acres in size.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed action was based on a landscape-level approach to ecosystem management, and included timber harvest
and reforestation in the Savant Sage Resource Area, through implementation of a single timber sale. The scope of the
proposed action is limited to timber harvesting, reforestation, and related road construction and reconstruction
activities. During development of the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action, emphasis was placed
on addressing the water resource needs and visual concerns of local residents.




Five alternatives were developed, including a No-Action Alternative. Alternative 4 is the alternative selected
by the Responsible Official. Alternative 4 provides resource management practices that move toward the desired
future conditions for the area, described in the Forest Plan, and includes several features favored by the public:
no new roads, large streamside management zones where no cutting will occur, no helicopter yarding, and protection
of unfragmented habitat. Alternative 4 demonstrates a balance between protecting visual, recreation, fragmentation,
biodiversity, watershed, and wildlife resources, and initiating treatment of disease conditions. It will allow
for the effective re-establishment of native tree species (white pine, ponderosa pine, and western larch), and will
reduce the risk of severe fires on the acres that are treated. Alternative 4 will provide timber volume to the timber
industry and funds to the local counties for schools and roads.



Management activities would be administered by the Fernan Ranger District of the Idaho Panhandle National Forests
in Kootenai County, Idaho. This EIS will tier to the Forest Plan (September 1987) which provides the overall guidance
(Goals, Objectives, Standards and Guidelines, and Management Area direction) in achieving the desired future condition
for this area.

<DOCTITLE>Eastside Forest Restoration Project, Tahoe National Forest, Sierra County, CA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for proposed
timber harvest, plantation thinning, fire hazard reduction, watershed restoration, and wildlife habitat improvement
projects for areas in the Feather 
River Watershed and Truckee River Watershed. The project area is located within portions of T.19N., R.14, 15, 16,
& 17E., T.20N., R.14, 15, 16, & 17E., and T.21N., R.15, 16, and 17E., MDB&M.



The agency invites comments and suggestions on the scope of the analysis. In addition, the agency gives notice of the
full environmental analysis and decision-making process that will occur on the proposal so that interested and affected
people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Eastside Analysis Area is about 85,000 acres in size. Most of the area is in the Feather River Watershed, with a small
portion in the Truckee River Watershed. It is located two miles south of Sierraville, southwest to Webber Lake, east
to the crest of the Bald Mountain Range, and north to approximately 4 miles south of Loyalton. The area is dominated
by eastside pine stands with catastrophic insect-induced mortality resulting from several years of severe drought.



The extensive mortality and overstocked timber stands have resulted in poor forest health and an extreme fire hazard.
There are opportunities to treat these stands in order to improve forest health and reduce the fire hazard, while concurrently
accomplishing watershed restoration and wildlife habitat improvement goals.


In preparing the environmental impact statement, the Forest Service will identify and analyze a range of alternatives
that address the issues developed for this area. One of the alternatives will be no treatment. Other alternatives
will consider differing levels of implementation of California spotted owl standards and guidelines, salvage and
sanitation treatments, group selection harvests, plantation thinning, thinnings from below, fuelbreak construction,
plantation protection from fire, watershed restoration, road obliteration, wildlife habitat improvement, and
new road construction and reconstruction. An ecological approach will be used to achieve multiple-use management
of the Eastside area. It also means that the needs of people and environmental values will be blended in such a way that
this area would represent a diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystems.



Public participation will be important during the analysis, especially during the review of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement. The Forest Service is seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and
local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action.
This input will be used in preparation of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS). The scoping process includes:

1. Identifying potential issues.

2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.

3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis.

4. Exploring additional alternatives.

5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions).

6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.

The following list of issues has been identified through initial scoping:

(1) To what extent will future options for the management of California spotted owls be maintained?


</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-2-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-2-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) To what extent can the potential for large catastrophic wildfires be reduced within the project area? 
(3) To what extent can the forest health be improved within the project area? In addition, what level of timber commodities
could result from forest health improvement projects? 
(4) To what extent will the view from Highway 49 and Highway 89 be affected? What will the visual character be resulting
from the proposed activities and to what extent will these activities affect views from private land within the study
area? 
(5) To what extent will water quality in the Feather River and the Truckee River watersheds be affected by the proposed
activities? 
(6) To what extent will air quality in the Sierra Valley and Truckee areas be affected by proposed activities? 
(7) To what extent will long term soil productivity be affected by proposed activities? 
Comments from other Federal, State, and local agencies, organizations, and individuals who may be interested in,
or affected by the decision, are encouraged to identify other significant issues. Public participation will be solicited
through mailing letters to potentially interested or affected mining claim owners, private land owners, and special
use permittees on the Sierraville Ranger District; posting information in local towns; and mailing letters to local
timber industries, politicians, school boards, county supervisors, and environmental groups. Continued participation
will be emphasized through individual contacts. Public meetings used as a method of public involvement during preparation
and review of the draft environmental impact statement will be announced in newspapers of general circulation in
the geographic area of such meetings well in advance of scheduled dates. 
The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by the end of January, 1995. The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes
the notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

. 
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v.

 NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion
of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel, 

803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of the court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS. 
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these
points. 
The final EIS is expected to be available by May, 1995. The responsible official is John H. Skinner, Forest Supervisor,
Tahoe National Forest.

Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

14,400 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

20,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

43 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The 1994 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey will update data on irrigation inputs and investment in the agricultural
production sector. Inadequate surface water, overuse of ground water, concerns about water quality, and increasing
competition for available water are currently recognized as problems of national concern. Agricultural irrigation
is the largest single use of available U.S. water supplies. Farm and ranch irrigation surveys have provided the only
source of detailed, nationally consistent data on water-management practices and water uses in American agriculture.
The 1994 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey will obtain data to describe the irrigation activities of U.S. farm operations.
The survey will collect critically needed data on issues of national concern, such as water conservation practices
and the chemical application practices of irrigators. Federal and state agencies, the irrigation industry, agricultural
producers, and universities will use the results of the survey in preparing a wide variety of water-related
programs, economic models, legislative initiatives, market analyses, and feasibility studies.


Affected Public: 

Farms.

<DOCTITLE>Action Affecting Export Privileges; Solomon Schwartz</DOCTITLE>




Order Denying Permission to Apply for or Use Export Licenses



In the matter of: Solomon Schwartz, Number 2 Hillside Terrace, Suffern, New York 10901.






On January 29, 1992, Solomon Schwartz (hereinafter referred to as ``Schwartz'') was convicted in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York of, among other crimes, four counts of violating the Arms Export Control
Act (22 U.S.C.A.  2778 (1990, Supp. 1993)) (the ``AECA''), for exporting night vision devices to Argentina
and the Soviet Union, and for exporting firearms and ammunition to Iraq and Poland, without obtaining the required
licenses or written approval from the U.S. Department of State. Section 11(h) of the Export Administration Act of
1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app.   2401-2420 (1991, Supp. 1993, and Pub. L. No. 103-10, March
27, 1993)) (the ``EAA''), provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,
 no person convicted of violating the AECA, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible
to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA or the Export Administration Regulations
(currently codified at 15 CFR Parts 768-799 (1993)) (the ``Regulations''), for a period of up to 10 years from
the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the EAA in which such a person had any
interest at the time of his conviction may be revoked.




Pursuant to   770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted
of violating the AECA, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export
Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued
pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license
previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Schwartz's conviction for violating the AECA, the following
consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Schwartz permission to apply
for or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations,
for a period of 10 years from the date of his conviction. The 10-year period ends on January 29, 2002. I have also decided
to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the EAA in which Schwartz had an interest at the time of his conviction.


Accordingly, it is 

hereby

 


Ordered

are hereby revoked and shall be returned forthwith to the Office of Export Licensing for cancellation. Further, all
of Schwartz's privileges of participating, in any manner or capacity, in any special licensing procedure, including,
but not limited to, distribution licenses, are hereby revoked.


II. Until January 29, 2002, Solomon Schwartz, Number 2, Hillside Terrace, Suffern, New York 10901, hereby is denied
all privileges of participating, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, in any transaction in the United
States or abroad involving any commodity or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States, in whole

or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States, and subject to the Regulations; and (v) in financing,
forwarding, transporting, or other servicing of such commodities or technical data.


III. After notice and opportunity for comment as provided in  770.15(h) of the Regulations, any person, firm,
corporation, or business organization related to Schwartz by affiliation, ownership, control, or position of responsibility
in the conduct of trade or related services may also be subject to the provisions of this Order.


IV. As provided in  787.12(a) of the Regulations, without prior disclosure of the facts to and specific authorization
of the Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, no person may directly or

transaction which is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, if the person denied export privileges may
obtain any benefit or have any interest in, directly or indirectly, any of these transactions.

Foreign-Trade Zone 84_Houston, TX; Application for Subzone Status 
Microwave Networks, Inc. (Microwave Radios) 


An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones 
Board (the Board) by the Port of Houston Authority, grantee of FTZ 84, requesting special-purpose subzone status
for the microwave radio manufacturing plant of Microwave Networks, Inc. (MNI), located in Houston, Texas. The application
was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and
the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on April 29, 1994. 

The MNI plant is located at 10795 Rockley Road, in Harris County, Houston, Texas. The facility (3.5 acres, 240 employees)
is used to manufacture microwave radios for use in cellular and other wireless communication networks (duty rates:
2.4% to 6%). 
Foreign-origin materials used in the manufacturing process (some 70% of total) include: Electronic transformers,
multiplexors, antennnas, transmitters/receivers, capacitors, resistors, printed circuits, diodes, transistors,
integrated circuits, insulated wire, coaxial cable, flexible RF waveguide and waveguide parts (duty rates: duty-free
to 10%). The application indicates that privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) would be elected on all foreign
merchandise admitted to the subzone. 
Zone procedures would exempt MNI from Customs duty payments on the foreign materials used in export production (90%
of output). On domestic sales, MNI would be able to defer Customs duty payments until the finished products leave the
plant. Foreign materials and finished products held for export would be eligible for an exemption from certain state
and local ad valorem taxes. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve MNI's
international competitiveness. 
In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the
application and report to the Board. 
Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July
15, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during
the subsequent 15-day period August 1, 1994. 
A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance renewal award.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) Criteria (A), the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology
Center (METC) gives notice of its plans to award a grant renewal to Syracuse University, Department of Chemical Engineering
& Materials Science Department, c/o Office of Sponsored Programs, 113 Bowne Hall, Syracuse, NY 13244-1200,
in the amount of approximately $150,000 and covers a twelve (12) month budget period.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The pending award is based on a renewal application for continuing work of an activity presently being funded by DOE
and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the activity.
The grant is to provide financial assistance to Syracuse University for conducting research focused on the utilization
of low-quality natural gas by economically upgrading the gas to pipeline quality via membrane separation processes.
The objective of this follow-on effort is to evaluate the potential usefulness of membrane separation processes
for the removal of acid gases, water vapor, and nitrogen from low-quality natural gas. The effort will comprise gas
permeability and separation measurements, process design studies, and economic evaluations using novel membrane
configurations which were developed under the current grant. By providing financial support, DOE expects to stimulate
utilization of U.S. natural gas resources, reduce oil imports, and help stabilize our energy supply.

(v) delete Form C, (vi) revise the term section of Form D_Capacity Release Agreement, and (vii) revise certain miscellaneous
capacity release provisions as explained in its tariff filing. Such modifications will simplify Transwestern's
capacity release program and make it more user-friendly.

With respect to Transwestern's EBB, Transwestern states that it proposes to: (i) Add provisions relating to the EBB
interactivity function (i.e. direct posting of Offers to Release Capacity and bids), (ii) delete provisions regarding
the posting of buy-sell arrangements, and (iii) delete provisions relating to a shipper's posting of a request to
purchase supplies.

With respect to operational provisions, Transwestern submits that the following tariff modifications will enable
it to maintain better control of its system. In light of actual experience under Order No. 636, Transwestern proposes
to: (i) Decrease the tolerance level in its Operator Balancing Agreement (``OBA''), (ii) provide additional incentives
for the timely resolution of imbalances, (iii) accommodate parties who wish to be aggregators for OBA purposes, (iv)
provide for an Alert Day in the event of operational distress, (v) provide for real-time nominations by shippers,
and (vi) change the operator confirmation deadline form 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Central time.

Finally, Transwestern is making certain miscellaneous tariff revisions relating to: (i) The now-obsolete FTS-2
cost-based sales rate, (ii) the definitions of ``day'' and ``month'', (iii) errors in billing and prior period adjustments,
(iv) nominations of receipts and deliveries, and (v) pre-OBA shipper imbalance provisions, as explained in more
detail therein.

Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions,
and all parties to this proceeding.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before
May 17, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but
will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any persons wishing to become a party must file a motion
to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy,
announces its interest in receiving applications to support one specific research area, Receptor-Targeted Cancer
Imaging and Therapy with Genetically Modified Radiolabeled Probes, within the Medical Applications Program. The
research applications should address the use of antibody-based molecular strategies to develop new radiolabeled
molecules which will significantly advance the current state of tumor imaging and therapy for potential human use.
Appropriate consideration should be given to receptor mediated localization and stability of the administered
molecular form 

in vivo,

 its rate of clearance, selective delivery to the target in high yield with target-binding affinity, and specificity
and selectivity for effective imaging and killing of cancer micrometastases. A well integrated multi-disciplinary
team effort combining the areas of radiopharmaceutical chemistry, molecular immunology, and oncologic nuclear
medicine to achieve the projected goals will be important.

federal law to address hazardous waste, and was designed to 
ensure that the generation, transportation, treatment, storage 
and disposal of hazardous wastes are conducted in a manner that 
``protects human health and the environment''. The cornerstone of 
the program, is the ability of facility personnel to properly 
identify their waste. The guidance manual is designed to assist 
the regulated community, permit writers and enforcement officials 
by establishing criteria to properly evaluate and prepare RCRA 
waste analysis plans.

documents.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal government currently satisfies its inter-city telecommunications services through the FTS2000 program.
The existing FTS2000 contracts will expire in 1998. As a part of the continuing, open discussion related to the post-FTS2000
provision of telecommunications services to Federal government users, the government hereby advises interested
parties of the following opportunities to participate in this discussion. The government released a report entitled,
``Post-FTS2000 Acquisition Alternatives White Paper'' on April 29, 1994. The report addresses the solicited
submissions from industry and other parties regarding the various approaches available for provisioning telecommunications
services for the post-FTS2000 environment. This report was prepared, as a framework for further study, by the
Acquisition Working Group, a subcommittee of the Interagency Management Council. At present, the government plans
that the report will be available for public viewing in the General Services Administration Bid Room and electronically
via the Internet (see below for access information). The government also plans to make available at these sites other
post-FTS2000 documents, including the report entitled, ``Networking for a Reinvented Government: Federal
Telecommunications Requirements and Industry Technology Assessment.'' The government will accept clarification
questions on the alternatives enumerated in the above report through May 31, 1994. Clarification questions may be
submitted to General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record, 7980 Boeing Court, Vienna,
Va 22182-3988. It is preferred that clarification questions be submitted electronically to the Internet address,
cdr@post.fts2k.gsa.gov. The government will provide responses to the clarification questions on or about July
1, 1994. At present, the government plans that the responses will be available for public viewing in the General Services
Administration Bid Room and electronically via the Internet (see below). The government also plans to make available
to interested parties an analysis report of the various acquisition alternatives on or about August 12, 1994. The
government will accept written comments on the alternatives report and the analysis report through September 23,
1994. Written comments may be submitted to General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record,
7980 Boeing Court, Vienna, VA 22182-3988. It is preferred that comments be submitted electronically to an Internet
address of cdr@post.fts2k.gsa.gov. The government also intends to invite verbal summaries, based on the written
comments received prior to August 30, 1994, to be presented before a Government Panel consisting of members of the
Interagency Management Council on September 13, 14, and 15, 1994.


The times and locations of these sessions will be announced on or about July 29, 1994. As a related matter, the government
is also interested in receiving written comments on the impact of the National Information Infrastructure's telecommunications
deregulation initiatives on industry for the post-FTS2000 environment. Written comments may be submitted
to General Services Administration, Attention: Concept Development Record, 7980 Boeing Court, Vienna, VA 22182-3988.

seeking applications from not-for-profit or for-profit organizations or entities to conduct research to examine
methods for assessing comprehensive community change initiatives and to develop possible solutions to assessment
problems for these initiatives. It is anticipated that a ``Cooperative Agreement'' will be awarded as a result of
this announcement.
The primary goal of the proposed research is to further the understanding of the problems confronted in assessing
the impact of comprehensive community change initiatives. These initiatives have several features that do not correspond
to traditional assessment methods: (1) They rely on a complex interaction of components, (2) they are intended to
produce impacts in several different spheres, (3) they are purposefully flexible and variable rather than standardized,
(4) they saturate a community, affecting all members of the community, and (5) they involve contexts and systems that
are in a continuous process of change. Given these difficulties, an examination is needed of how assessment of these
initiatives can be improved.


A. Type of Application Requested


1. Background


ASPE has a long history of interest in comprehensive human services efforts and the methods of assessing the impact
of such efforts. This includes an interest in service integration projects, as well as an interest in community-based
human services reform. The office has funded assessments of individual projects and clearinghouses for information
on comprehensive strategies.
Several private foundations have recently created initiatives that attempt to change human service and other systems
in communities. These initiatives attempt to work across systems, involving the social services, the health care
system, the schools, and economic and physical redevelopment. They are generally focused on one or more urban communities.
Examples of foundation initiatives include several foundation-sponsored efforts such as the Annie E. Casey foundation's
New Futures Initiative, the Pew Charitable Trust's Children's Initiative, and the Ford Foundation's Neighborhood
and Family Initiative. Recent federal initiatives, such as the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiative,
include similar features.

2. Research Approach



As a background for further work, the organization should investigate and document how comprehensive community
change initiatives have been assessed in the past, how they are now being assessed, and the problems and successes
encountered in assessing these initiatives. Many problems in assessing comprehensive initiatives are not new and
are not confined to any one set of social reform efforts. Such an investigation would identify similarities and differences
in the types of assessments underway, the processes being described, and the outcomes being measured, cataloging
topics requiring attention for the next generation of initiatives and for assessment of the current generation and
creating a research agenda for the field.

Possible topics and research activities of interest may include the following:

 Articulating the assumptions and hypotheses underlying existing comprehensive community change initiatives.
This work would clarify the causal connections that assessments of initiatives should explore. Such work might include
collaborating with a specific initiative to map the assumptions and expected causal relationships. The creation
of an outline of assumptions, hypotheses, and causal connections should involve many different perspectives, including
the funders, developers, technical assistance providers, and community participants of initiatives.

 Generating, based on the improved articulation of assumptions and hypotheses, a set of interim progress indicators
with clear links to the ultimate goals of the initiative.

 Identifying gaps in measurement that hold back assessment and working to improve measurement tools. This
work could involve participating with an initiative to test methods. Results would then be summarized for the field.

 Developing suggestions for improved assessment practice. For example, developing methods appropriate
for initiatives that saturate a community, making it impossible to randomly select individuals in treatment and
control groups.

 Other topics as defined by the work group.



3. Awardee and Government Responsibilities



A. Awardee Responsibilities



1. Establish a work group of experts and knowledgeable practitioners to assist the project. The work group should

<DOCTITLE>Availability of Funds for New Community Health Centers, and Expanded Community Health Center Activities</DOCTITLE>








<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration, PHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of funds.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the availability of discretionary grant funds
of approximately $12.5 million in fiscal year (FY) 1994 under section 330 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to
establish new community health centers (CHCs) and new CHC service delivery sites for existing CHCs. For more than
twenty-five years, the CHC program has been working toward ensuring the availability and accessibility of essential
primary health services to those individuals who have the most limited access to services. The goal of the CHC New Start
and Expansion strategy is to extend primary health services to populations currently without such services and to
improve the health status of medically underserved individuals by supporting the development and maintenance of
systems of care in areas where such systems are lacking or inadequate.


The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000,
a PHS-led national activity. The health center program directly addresses the Healthy People 2000 objectives by
improving access to preventive and primary care services for underserved populations, especially minority and
other disadvantaged populations. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of 

Healthy People 2000

 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or 

Healthy People 2000

 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-01) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone 202-783-3228).
The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American people.

Supplementary Information:
Grant Amounts


Approximately $12.5 million in discretionary grants to establish CHCs in new geographic areas and/or to establish
new CHC service delivery sites for existing CHCs in new or existing geographic areas will be made available under section
330 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 254c). Of the approximately $12.5 million available, approximately $8.5 million will
be directed to new CHCs and approximately $4 million will be directed to new CHC service delivery sites that expand
the service capacity (i.e., increase the number of new patients served) of existing CHCs.


Number of Awards


Approximately 35 to 40 section 330 awards will be made. The awards will range up to $600,000, including a limit of $150,000
for capital requests. Awards will be made for a one year budget period. Project periods for new CHCs will be for up to
two years, while expansion grants will have project periods consistent with the ongoing grant.


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants for new CHCs are public or private nonprofit entities. Section 329 grantees not currently receiving
section 330 funds may request section 330 funds to support primary health services for other than migrant and seasonal
farmworkers and their families. The proposed service area must be a defined geographic area or population which is
federally designated, in whole or in part, as a MUA or MUP. Applicants must be prepared to provide the comprehensive
primary health services required under section 330, and supplemental services necessary to assure that required
primary health services are provided effectively.
Eligible applicants for CHC expansions must be current recipients of section 330 funds. The applicant's proposed
delivery system, in conjunction with its current delivery capacity, must provide the comprehensive primary health
services required under section 330, and supplemental services necessary to assure that required primary health
care services are provided effectively. The proposed service area must be a defined geographic area or population
which is federally designated, in whole or in part, as a MUA or MUP.


Criteria for Evaluation


When determining whether Federal support will be made available for CHC new start or expansion grants, the Department
will review the applications for compliance with standard criteria stipulated in the program regulations (42 CFR
51c.305 for operating CHCs). These include:
(a) The relative need of the population to be served for the services to be provided based on the following indicators:

For urban applicants: (1) Percentage of the population with incomes below 200 percent of the official poverty level;
(2) percentage of minority populations; (3) percentage of the population that is uninsured; (4) a shortage of necessary
primary care health professionals to meet the needs of the target population; and (5) other documented community
health issues such as a high unemployment rate, high growth rate of minority/special populations, high percentage
of immigrant population, high infant mortality rate/high percentage of low birthweight, late entry into prenatal
care, high teenage pregnancy rate, high morbidity rates due to specific diseases, high percentage geriatric population,
cultural/language barriers, or excessive travel time/distance to next nearest source of primary care for the target
population.
For rural applicants: (1) Percentage of the population with incomes below 200 percent of the official poverty level;
(2) geographic barriers based on average travel time/distance to next nearest source of primary care that is accessible
to the target population; (3) percentage of the population that is uninsured; (4) shortage of necessary primary care
health professionals to meet the needs of the target population; and (5) other documented community health issues
such as a high unemployment rate, high growth rate of minority/special populations, high percentage of immigrant
population, high infant mortality rate/high percentage of low birthweight, late entry into prenatal care, high
teenage pregnancy rate, high morbidity rates due to specific diseases, high percentage geriatric population, cultural/language
barriers, or a high percentage of minority populations; and
(b) The extent to which the applicant's project plan for CHC new start or expansion grants meets the program requirements:
For CHC New Start and Expansions in New Service Areas: (1) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates an understanding
of its State and local health care environment (e.g., identifying key State health care initiatives/proposals and
describing local community resources/providers), and addresses how it will position itself strategically in both
of these environments;
(2) The applicant's capability in the following health services/clinical management areas: (i) A service delivery
plan that addresses the priority health problems of the target population; (ii) provision of patient case management,
the assurance of continuity of care and a quality assurance program; and (iii) an appropriate number and mix of primary
care physicians, non-physician primary care providers and clinical support staff to support the clinical component
of the service delivery plan;
(3) The degree to which the applicant ensures that its governing board is appropriately structured and has by-laws
reflecting all its functions and responsibilities. A public entity must be able to meet all governance requirements
or have an acceptable co-applicant board (governing boards of public centers by statute are not required to set general
policies for the center);
(4) The administrative and management capability of the applicant, particularly the extent to which center operations
will emphasize efficiency of operations and sound financial management;
(5) The extent to which the proposed facility is adequate and available to meet the projected demand of the target population;
and
(6) Whether the proposed new start will result in new patients being served or, for expansion applicants, whether
the proposed expansion will result in new patients being served through a new service delivery site.
For CHC Expansions in an Existing Service Area: Applicants will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
(1) The extent to which the grantee justifies a patient demand in excess of what is reasonable for the current organization
to serve;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940516-2-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The extent to which the service delivery plan addresses the priority health problems of the new patients to be served;

(3) The extent to which the proposed expansion plan is a reasonable and cost-effective solution to meet the projected
demand; 
(4) The extent to which the budget is reasonable and appropriate and corresponds to the objective of the request for
funds; 
(5) The extent to which the proposed facility is adequate and available to meet the projected demand of the target population;
and 
(6) Whether the proposed expansion will result in new patients being served through a new service delivery site. 
The HRSA hopes to achieve a wide geographic dispersion of awards. Contingent upon the outcome of the review process,
grant awards will be made in such a manner as to achieve a distribution of resources throughout the country. Special
consideration will be given to applicants that received Section 330(c) planning grant funds in FY 1993 to assist in
their development of a new CHC. 
Other Award Information: All grants to be awarded under this notice are subject to the provisions of Executive Order
12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications
from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kit will contain a listing
of States which have chosen to set up a review system and will identify a State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) in each
State for the review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their
SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on
State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each
affected State. State process recommendations should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office (see Appendix).
The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline date. The Bureau
of Primary Health Care does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State process recommendations
received after this date. 
Public Health System Reporting Requirement: These programs are subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirement,
PHS Circular 92.01. Reporting requirements have been approved by the OMB_0937-0195. Under this requirement,
the community-based nongovernmental applicant must prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement
(PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State and local health officials to keep them apprised of
proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based nongovernmental organizations within
their jurisdictions.

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Proposed Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for
Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1994 Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships under the authority of section 831(b), title VIII
of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992,
title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102-408, dated October 13,
1992. Comments are invited on the proposed criteria for meeting the general statutory funding preference. 

Approximately $100,000 will be available in FY 1994 for this program. It is anticipated that $100,000 will be available
to support 10 competing awards averaging $10,000. 



Previous Funding Experience 



Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions
regarding submission of an application for this program. In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 22 applications for Grants for
Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships. Of those applications, 100 percent were approved. Fifteen projects, or
68% of applications received, were funded. In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 9 applications for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist
Faculty Fellowships. Of those applications, 100 percent were approved and funded. 



Purpose 



Section 831(b) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to provide financial assistance
to certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNA) who are faculty members in accredited programs to enable such
nurse anesthetists to obtain advanced education relevant to their teaching functions. Applicants must compete
for Federal support annually. 



Eligibility 



Public and private nonprofit institutions which employ CRNA faculty to teach registered nurses in a full-time accredited
nurse anesthetist training program may apply for a Grant for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships. 



National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 



The Public Health Service urges applicants to submit work plans that address specific objectives of Healthy People
2000. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017-001-00474-0)
or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent
of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (Telephone 202-783-3238).




Education and Service Linkage 



As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public
Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.




Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Criteria for Fellows 



The following criteria for fellows were established in FY 1993 after public comment (58 FR 40658, 7/29/93), and will
be extended in fiscal year 1994.

<DOCNO> FR940516-2-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To be eligible for fellowship support an individual must be: 

1. A United States citizen, noncitizen national, or foreign national who possesses a visa permitting permanent residence
in the United States; 

2. A certified registered nurse anesthetist with current licensure to practice, and with teaching responsibilities
in an accredited nurse anesthetist education program; 

3. Enrolled or accepted for enrollment in a formal program of study which leads to a master's or doctoral degree; 

4. Proposed for a fellowship in the applicant institution's grant proposal; and 

5. A faculty member employed by, or affiliated with, the applicant institution during the period of approved fellowship
support. 



Policy on Payment of Stipends 



The following policy on payment of stipends was established in fiscal year 1990 after public comment (55 FR 36325,
dated September 5, 1990) and is being extended in fiscal year 1994. 

A faculty member may be paid a stipend for living costs if attending an educational institution as a full-time student;
no stipend would be available for a faculty member who is enrolled in part-time study or who is employed on a full-time
basis. This policy is designed to target stipend assistance to the individuals who are most in need of such aid. 



Review Criteria 



Applications will be reviewed and award amounts will be calculated by staff in the Division of Nursing and in the Grants
Management Branch of the Bureau of Health Professions. The review of applications will take into consideration the
following criteria: 




1. The eligibility of applicants; 
2. The eligibility of faculty; and 
3. The extent to which an applicant meets the funding preferences. 




These review criteria were established in 1990 (55 FR 36325, 9/5/90). Different criteria were established for use
in FY 1993 to meet the statutory requirement for peer review. The requirement for peer review was deleted by Public
Law 103-43. 



Other Considerations 



In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 

A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 

It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 



Statutory Funding Preference 



Section 860(e) of the PHS Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title
II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, enacted on October
13, 1992, provides for the following statutory preference for this program of Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty
Fellowships, as well as for certain other programs under titles VII and VIII of the PHS Act. 

Statutory preference will be given to qualified applicants that: (1) Have a high rate for placing graduates in practice
settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (2) have achieved,
during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, a significant increase in the
rate of placing graduates in such settings. 

This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have
been recommended for approval. 



Proposed Criteria for Meeting the General Statutory Funding Preference 



It is proposed that, for Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Faculty Fellowships, qualified applicants will meet the general
statutory funding preference if a minimum of 50% of the nurse anesthetist faculty are teaching in medically underserved
communities.

Office of Minority Health; Cooperative Agreement for Family and Community Violence; Prevention Demonstration
Program; Notice of Availability of Funds and Request for Application



Introduction



The Office of Minority Health (OMH) announces the availability of Fiscal Year 1994 funds to support a cooperative
agreement with a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Specifically, the intent
of this project is to design, develop, implement, and test a series of models that may be effective in preventing minority
male related violence in such communities.

Models developed under this project should address behavioral patterns and environmental influences that may precipitate
violence within the family or the community. Such factors may contribute to dysfunctional patterns of individual
behavior or dysfunctional relationships within families. They include breakdowns in family structure, alcoholism
and drug abuse, lack of economic and job opportunities, educational deficiencies, poverty, and crime. With respect
to domestic violence, these issues may include spousal and child abuse and rape; transmission of violent behavior
to subsequent generations; societal and family relationships.

Multi-purpose family support systems are planned through both linkages and consortiums of campus based centers
and participating official and private community based organizations providing a range of prevention and service
interventions. Interventions will be directed toward several different target populations including primary
school (k-5), junior high school (6-8), and high school as well as young adults, adults, parents, and the
elderly. They will involve, but not be limited to certain common strategies such as target group focused education;
individual counseling, treatment and individually relevant assistance; and referral to public and private agencies,
which includes the college and university based family support center or the participating professionals, institutions
and organizations within the community. The provider system encompasses colleges and university students and faculty,
parents, school officials and teachers, a large array of professionals and official community agencies. The system
is designed to utilize and expand the expertise of these educational institutions and other community resources
in the areas to be addressed. The consortium consists of 16 Historically and Predominantly Black Colleges and Universities
(HBCUs) and a number of key public and private entities functioning together to improve the lives of individuals residing
throughout the communities in which they live.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objective
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve the quality of
life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Violence and Abusive Behavior, which includes the following
sub-areas: homicide, suicide, weapon-related deaths, child abuse and neglect, spousal abuse, assault injuries,
suicide attempts by adolescents, physical fighting among youth, weapon-carrying youth and comprehensive violence
programs.

Authority



This project is authorized under, section 1707(d)(1), Public Health Service Act.



Eligible Applicant



Approximately $4,250,000 is available to support a family and community violence prevention effort. Assistance
will be provided to Central State University of Wilberforce, Ohio, which will serve as the lead entity for the consortium
of 16 Historical and Predominately Black Colleges and Universities, specifically the Consortium for Practicum
and Research on Minority Males/Minority Males Consortium (MIN-MALES. The Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Minority Health has determined that this consortium is uniquely qualified to receive this award because it is
a pre-existing proven consortium which can respond rapidly to the OMH requirement to complete the award process this
fiscal year. Each institution participating in this existing consortium is already actively involved in on-campus
or in neighborhoods/community based projects that are designed to remedy minority male and family educational and
health problems. Furthermore, all participating institutions are working in an official and coordinated capacity
to focus specifically on violence-related problems faced by minority communities. In addition, the consortium
members are geographically distributed in such a manner that allows them to access and service a large and diverse
number of racial and ethnic minorities.

They have established functional working relationships with community-based organizations, churches, schools,
prisons, etc. * * * which demonstrates the existence of a viable network with cultural competence
and existing outreach mechanisms targeting multiple racial and ethnic family populations. This consortium is uniquely
prepared by virtue of its expertise, geographic distribution and existing network to implement a model family domestic
violence program expeditiously. No other applications will be solicited.



Availability of Funds



Approximately $4,250,000 (indirect and direct costs) will be available in Fiscal Year 1994 to fund this cooperative
agreement. The project is expected to begin on September 30, 1994, for a 12 month budget period within a project period
not to exceed 3 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress
and availability of funds. The funding estimate above may vary and is subject to change.



Background



Violent and abusive behavior exacts a large toll on the physical and mental health of Americans. Child abuse, spouse
abuse, and other forms of intrafamilial violence continue to threaten the health of thousands of American families,
particularly minorities.

In 1986, an estimated 1.6 million children nationwide experienced some form of abuse or neglect. Physical abuse accounted
for the greatest portion of abuse incidents. Studies suggest that between 2 million and 4 million women are physically
battered each year by their partners. On an annual basis, more than 1 million women seek medical assistance for injuries
caused by battering. Also, the vast majority of domestic homicides are preceded by episodes of violence. Domestic
violence is a major context for suicide attempts, substance abuse, and mental illness among women and 45 percent of
mothers of abused children are themselves battered women.

<DOCNO> FR940516-2-00064 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-2-00046 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The characteristics of homicides indicate a clear and consistent pattern of friend and family violence. Half of the
yearly 23,000 homicide victims in the United States die at the hands of an acquaintance. For example, family members
are responsible for 20 percent of the deaths whereas casual acquaintances are responsible for 30 percent.
During 1985, the Surgeon General and the U.S. Public Health Service provided a national focus on violence as a leading
public health problem in the United States. Since that time, public health perspectives in preventing death and disability
due to violent and abusive behavior have emerged across the country.
Violence in America is a public health problem that takes its greatest toll on young minority males. Minority males
have the highest rates of contact with the criminal justice system of any group in the nation. In 1987, more than half
of all prison inmates in the nation were Black or Hispanic males. Problems confronting minority males are those particularly
associated with poverty, violence, single parent households, school drop-out rates, delinquency, unemployment,
access to higher education and health status. The American Council on Education recently reported that African American
Male enrollment in colleges and universities declined by five percent, while the enrollment among Hispanic males
remained constant, between 1990-1992.


Purpose


The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to design, implement, and assess the use of a consortium to conduct model
centers for the development and demonstration of interventions related to minority male, family and community violence.


Program Requirements


The consortium will design, implement, and assess Minority Male, Family and Community Violence Prevention Models
which maximize the leadership of minority institutions of higher education in: (1) Organizing a total ``town and
gown'' initiative with respect to both their own functions and responsibilities and those of entities to be involved
throughout the community, e.g., primary/secondary schools, churches, public agencies; (2) The life centers should
at a minimum conduct the following:
 Assess local community resources dedicated to address problems of family and community violence.
 Coordinate with local violence efforts currently in place to minimize duplication of efforts and to maximize
use of local resources.
 Specifically, though not exclusively, address the problem of interpersonal family violence by designing
and implementing an educational/prevention intervention.
 Design and implement a student assessment project to identify students from dysfunctional families and to
delineate positive and negative coping strategies.
(3) developing educational experiences, preventive measures and therapeutic interventions designed to address
the issues of dysfunctional males and families; and (4) formulating methods and strategies for execution of the initiatives
through a variety of avenues within the minority institutions of higher education and throughout the community.
This initiative seeks to address the escalating national problems experienced by dysfunctional families and individuals
in the minority community. These national problems are precipitated by such conditions as breakdowns in family structures,
alcoholism and drug abuse, educational deficiencies, poverty, crime, and violence.
The consortium will establish a maximum of sixteen (16) Family Life Centers on the campuses of minority institutions
of higher education. A complete organizational structure will be developed for initiatives to be executed through
this program with respect to both the minority institutions of higher education and community components involved
including methodologies and strategies for their operation. The consortium will develop and test the interventions
and other programmatic content for all facets of the program that are internal and external to the minority institutions
of higher education. These include, methods of their delivery and the competencies necessary for all students and
professionals involved (mentor, counselors, faculty, etc.) in carrying out the interventions.
Use of Cooperative Agreement: A cooperative agreement will be awarded because of the anticipated substantial programmatic
involvement by OMH staff. OMH will take the lead programmatic responsibility for this activity and will work in collaboration
with other PHS and DHHS co-sponsoring entities. Substantial programmatic involvement is as follows:

Information for Inclusion, OMB Clearance Package, Public Housing Residents Anti-Crime Survey Sponsored by U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Conducted by Research Triangle Institute



Section A: Justification



A.1 Circumstances That Make Information Collection Necessary



The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is currently implementing Operation Safe Home, a joint
anti-crime effort with the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Treasury, and the Office of National Drug
Control, to eliminate criminal activity in public housing. A key component of Safe Home is coordinated strikes by
federal agencies against drug-related crime in public housing. Predatory violent crime in public housing also has
been targeted for action. In an effort to make Operation Safe Home as effective as possible, the Secretary wants to
survey public housing residents on their opinions regarding crime and associated problems.



A.2 Use and Users of Information_Overview of Data Requirements



These survey data will be used directly by the Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) to strengthen HUD's crime prevention
activities in public housing and by the Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) to enhance HUD's policy
and legislative initiatives for crime prevention in a broad range of other settings as well.



A.3 Consideration of the Use of Improved Information Technology


The survey is utilizing several technological approaches to create an innovative way to efficiently gather information
from a population in which data collection has traditionally been difficult. We are creating the sampling frame for
the telephone interviews by obtaining recent telephone numbers for the sample or addresses, using a commercial file
matching service. The phone numbers obtained will be loaded into an electronic scheduler which will assign cases
to interviews at times which maximize the probability of successful contact. The scheduling algorithm considers
time zones, time and result of previous efforts, and the most appropriate time to make calls to residences, as well
as handling specific call-back appointments.

Once contact has been made with an eligible residence, and an eligible respondent selected, the Computer Assisted
Telephone Interview (CATI) program will guide the interviewer through the questionnaire. Respondent burden is
reduced since CATI selects the correct question sequence based on the respondent's previous answers allowing the
interviewer to concentrate on reading the question and entering the response, not searching for the correct next
question. CATI requires the entry of consistent data which falls into appropriate ranges thus eliminating editing
time while the respondent is on the phone or callbacks to resolve problems. The CATI program can also offer the opportunity
of providing the questions and response categories in an alternate language, if needed to allow special population
to participate fully.



A.4 Efforts to Identify Duplication



The Department has examined existing administrative data sources to determine if similar data are collected. The
information that this survey seeks to gather is not available from existing administrative or other survey instruments.
This is the first telephone survey of its kind to focus on public housing residents.



A.5 Why Similar, Already Available Data Cannot Be Used



There does not exist a source of data on the attitudes of public housing residents toward crime/crime prevention issues
equivalent to what is being collected in this effort. The Department regularly collects information (such as income
and number of dependents) on residents of low-income public housing developments for use in administering low-income
housing programs but does not collect information on resident's perceptions of crime and safety, and their opinions
of programs that could effectively address these issues.



A.6 Reducing the Burden



The only burden associated with this survey is the 25 minute interview which respondents agree to complete. As discussed
in Item A.3, the use of CATI minimizes the burden associated with the mode of administration.



A.7 Consequences of Less Frequent Data Collection



Since this is a one-time data collection effort, this section is not applicable.



A.8 Special Circumstances Requiring Inconsistency With 5CFR1320.6



All data collection procedures and data collection instruments have been designed in a manner which is in compliance
with all sections of 5 CFR 1320.6. No exceptions are requested.



A.9 Consultations With Persons Outside the Agency



The survey design and the data collection instrument have been designed by project staff at the Research Triangle
Institute (RTI) working under contract from HUD to design and completer the survey. RTI staff and their consultant,
Dr. William Rohe from the University of North Carolina, have worked closely with the HUD project staff to develop the
questionnaire and the sampling approach which will be used with standard telephone data collection procedures to
complete the survey. During the questionnaire design, RTI methodologists consulted with the staff from the Census
Bureau on issues of question wording and ordering.



A.10 Confidentiality



During an introduction to the interview which address the components of informed consent, all respondents will be
assured that the information that they provide will remain confidential, and that they can refuse to answer any individual
question during the interview. No names are requested and the address and telephone numbers will not be included in
the data file prepared and delivered to HUD. Any location information used in the analyses will be presented in composite
form which will not allow the identification of individual respondents.

All project staff and each telephone interviewer will comply with all aspects of relevant federal regulations concerning
privacy of respondent's data, and the data will be maintained in limited access secured computer files.



A.11 Justification for Questions of a Sensitive Nature



During their cognitive and telephone pretest interviews, we attempted to identify questions which the respondents
might consider sensitive. None of the respondents indicated any problems with the questions in the questionnaire.
We did replace a household income question with a proxy measure, monthly rent, which we felt would be less intrusive.



A.12 Estimates of Cost



The cost of the survey design, data collection, and analysis and reporting contract to RTI is $142,401.



A.13 Estimates of Respondents



The sample will consist of 2,500 telephone numbers which will be screened to determine eligibility, defined as a working
residential number at the address determined for the sample. These screening calls will require an average of 5 minutes.
The interview will be completed for 1,500 respondents and will take, on average, 25 minutes. The total burden is estimated
to be 833 hours.



A.14 Reasons for Change in Respondent Burden



Since this is a one-time effort, there is no change in the respondent burden.

A.15 Plans for Publication and Statistical Tabulation 
 
 


RTI will prepare a databook presenting outcome variables cross-tabulated by independent variables. A final results
report will provide summary tables and/or graphics that present main findings and text that interprets and gives
highlights of the main findings. 
 


Section B: Statistical Methods of Data Collection 
 


B.1 Sampling Method and Respondent Universe 
 


B.1.1 Target Population and Respondent Universe 
 
 


The target population, the desired inference population, comprises all public housing residents in the 48 coterminous
States. The respondent universe or study population, defined as the portion of the target population actually being
sampled from, is essentially the public housing residents in the 48 States that have listed telephone numbers. Because
of undercoverage of this list source compared to the target population, that is, residents with no listed telephone
and some that are not covered by the HUD address file (the 951 data base), special attention is being given to the sample
allocation and to the construction of analysis weights to improve interferences relating to the target population.

 
 
The basic source of sample residents will be the HUD 951 data base, which is basically an address file. The approximately
300,000 addresses on this file represent 68 percent of the 1.3 million public housing units in the United States. Those
not represented are the result of nonreporting, data errors, and indefinite addresses (rural addresses, etc.) provided
to HUD in response to the periodic mailout to all of the Public Housing Authorities. The circa 300,000 records identify
on the average about three housing units each because of a single address and file record representing a multi-family
unit in many cases. The respondent universe will be developed by matching these addresses to telephone listings.

 


B.1.2 Sampling Method 
 
 


The sample public housing resident will be selected in several phases beginning with a proportional stratified sample
of approximately 25,000 addresses obtained from the 300,000 records on the 951 data base (proportional to the target
population counts in 32 strata). The strata to be used at each phase are the cross of 4 Census Regions, 4 sizes of Housing
Authority, and by housing for elderly versus other. The telephone numbers obtained from the addresses selected for
matching will be subsampled, again using random stratified sampling with proportional allocation. The result will
be a nearly self-weighting sample with respect to the target population. 
 
 
Approximately 2500 telephone numbers will be selected for fielding, possibly in two waves to facilitate early testing
of analysis and weighting software and with expectation of obtaining 1500 interviews required for the study. Finally,
any eligible individual (a resident of the household who is 18 years of age or older) will become the sample respondent.

 
 
The sample of 1500 is expected to yield sampling errors ranging from about 2 to 4 percentage points for the required
domain estimates when the estimates are near 50 percent (the domains will be approximately 15 percent or more of the
total). 
 


B.2 Procedures To Deal With Nonresponse 
 
 


Two categories of nonresponse are important in this survey: first, the undercoverage of the sampling frame and, second,
the potential nonparticipation of those residents contacted. With regard to the potential for nonparticipation,
we are making allowance for nonworking numbers, other types of loss, and approximately a 20 to 25 percent nonresponse
by fielding 2500 numbers to obtain the required 1500 interviews. 
 
 
To deal with potential for nonresponse and undercoverage biases, we are also developing analysis weights that align
the final sample with known control totals (with regard to the design strata defined above). Finally, other control
totals will be compared to weighted frequencies (based on the initial analysis weights). Additional weight adjustments
using iterative proportional fitting will be used as needed to agree with other important control totals (for example,
age, race, metro/nonmetro). 
 


B.3 Pretesting 
 
 


RTI staff conducted pretesting of the questionnaire during the second week of the contract. The testing included
four cognitive interviews and eight telephone interviews with residents of public housing facilities in Durham,
North Carolina. The four in-depth cognitive interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes each, including introductory
and concluding comments. Respondents were paid $20 for participating in the interview. During each interview, the
respondents listened to the survey questions and responded to each as appropriate. We used concurrent probing during
the interview to obtain insight into how respondents were interpreting question wording and choosing the best response
option. In addition, we asked respondents to comment on what we felt were the most sensitive items (for example, the
gun ownership and income questions) in order to determine the likelihood that respondents would provide valid responses.

 
 
We also conducted 8 telephone interviews to determine if there were any additional changes to the questionnaire that
were needed due to the mode of administration. All respondents were paid $10 for completing the interview. These calls
averaged about 25 minutes each. Three of these interviews were conducted by project survey specialists and methodologists.
The remaining interviews were conducted by RTI Telephone Survey Unit (TSU) supervisors, and were monitored by one
of the project survey specialists. After each of these interviews, the interviewer completed a debriefing form with
the respondent and then answered a similar set of items gauging his or her perception of how well the questionnaire
worked. 
 
 
Based on these pretest interviews, we prepared a series of recommendations which were faxed to HUD and used as the basis
of a series of discussions of potential revisions. The revisions which were agreed upon were included in the final
version of the questionnaire, which is included in Section B5.

Supporting Statement


1. Need for Information and Legal Requirements


Section 3 Reporting Form


Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3) mandates that the Department ensure that employment
and other economic opportunities generated by its housing and community development assistance programs are, to
the greatest extent feasible, directed toward low- and very low-income persons, particularly those who are recipients
of government assistance for housing.
The Housing and Community Development Act (HCDA) of 1992 requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to submit to the Congress, not later than one year after the date of enactment, a report describing (1) the Secretary's
efforts to enforce Section 3; (2) barriers to full implementation of Section 3; (3) the anticipated costs and benefits
of full implementation of Section 3; and (4) recommendations for legislative changes to enhance the effectiveness
of Section 3.
Congressional actions support the need for a data collection instrument to assess Section 3's impact. Responding
to a directive in the Conference Report on the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the Department in FY 1991
issued a report to Congress. This report assessed the impact of HUD-assisted activities on enhancing the employment
opportunities for lower income persons and the use of businesses located in the area of assisted projects. Further,
the Fair Housing Act, as amended in 1988, at Section 808(e)(6) requires the Secretary of HUD to report annually to Congress,
and make available to the public, data on beneficiaries of HUD-assisted programs pursuant to Section 3. In addition,
Section 562 paragraph (a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 requires HUD to collect data and report
annually to Congress on the racial and ethnic characteristics of persons eligible for, assisted by or otherwise benefiting
from each community development and housing assistance program administered by HUD. Since the provisions of Section
3 apply to community development and housing assistance programs, Section 562 authorizes the Secretary to collect
information determined to be necessary and appropriate in order to complete this report. In spite of these numerous
reporting requirements, no data is collected on Section 3 which allows the Department to determine the potential
or to evaluate the impact of the statute in meeting its objectives.
Congress, as well as the Department's Office of Inspector General, have admonished the Department in failing to systematically
implement Section 3. The primary impediment is the absence of a regulation which conforms to the statute and applies
to all Section 3 covered assistance.
The regulations governing Section 3 at 24 CFR Part 135 have been revised to incorporate the statutory amendments in
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992; reflect certain changes in the Department's programs that are
subject to the Section 3 regulations; clarify the obligations of individuals and entities subject to the requirements
of Section 3; and simplify the Department's administration of Section 3 requirements. The revised regulations include
recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
The section 3 proposed rule was published on October 8, 1993 for public comment. As a result of comments received, the
Department made a number of changes to the rule. Accordingly, the previously approved section 3 reporting form, OMB
No. 2529-0043, was revised to reflect the changes made in the rule.
Changes in the rule affecting the recordkeeping and reporting requirements are the establishment of numerical goals
to be reported in staff hours for training and employment and numerical goals to be reported in percentages for contracting
opportunities. The section 3 reporting form, OMB No. 2529-0043, requested that data be reported on the number
of section 3 residents hired in available positions and the total dollar amount of contracts awarded to section 3 business
concerns. Based on revisions to the rule, the data collection will reflect staff hours for new hires and section 3 positions,
and a percentage of the total dollar amount of contracts awarded to section 3 business concerns. These are elements
needed for an effective program performance measurement system as required under the Government Performance and
Results Act of 1993.
In addition, we are adding a Complaint Register which will be used to file section 3 complaints for your approval. Although
the regulations implementing section 3, since 1973 have provided for HUD processing of allegations of non-compliance,
this is the first request for OMB approval of a formal complaint form for this requirement.
The Department is seeking a three year approval of the revised section 3 reporting form, OMB No. 2529-0043; and
the section 3 complaint form.

Complaint Register 



The Complaint Register for section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (Section 3 Compliant Form) is
necessary for the collection of information relative to the investigation of allegations of noncompliance pursuant
to Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended (Section 3). Section 3 requires that the Department,
to the greatest extent feasible, provide: (1) job and training opportunities for lower income persons within that
unit of local government or the metropolitan area (or nonmetropolitan county) where the project is located; and (2)
business opportunities for firms located or owned in substantial part by persons in the same metropolitan area (or
nonmetropolitan county) as the project. The regulation at 24 CFR part 135 provides that Section 3 residents and business
concerns may file a complaint alleging noncompliance with Section 3 by a recipient, contractor or subcontractor.
The complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged violation. 

It is anticipated that the Section 3 Complaint Form will help to expedite the acceptance of complaints because the
form guides the complainants to include all necessary components of the complaint, thereby saving costs associated
with staff time that would otherwise be spent securing additional information that would be necessary to complete
a complaint. 



Statutory Authority 



The authorization for the information collection on the Section 3 Reporting Form is Section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, as amended, 12 U.S.C. 1701u. The implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR Part 135 Subpart
F_Recordkeeping and Reporting. 

The authorization for Section 3 Complaint Form is Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended,
12 U.S.C. 1701u. The implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR Part 135 Subpart D_Complaint and Compliance Review.
The Section 3 Complaint Form was developed to provide for uniformity in the information that, by regulation, must
be included in a complaint and for the convenience of the public. The Section 3 regulation (24 CFR Part 135) states what
each complaint should contain. For purposes of meeting the time requirement for filing complaints (180 days), initially
these complaints do not have to be submitted on the form that HUD provides.




2. Use of Information 



The Section 3 Reporting Form will be used by the Department to monitor program recipients' compliance with Section
3. HUD Headquarters will use the information to assess the results of the Department's efforts to meet the statutory
objectives of Section 3. Also, the data collected will be used by recipients as a self-monitoring tool. If the information
is not collected, HUD will be unable to prepare the mandatory reports to Congress or to assess the effectiveness of
Section 3. 

The Section 3 Complaint Form will be used by a complainant to provide the necessary information to file a complaint.
A complaint may be filed by mail, in person or by telephone with the Office of Fair Housing And Equal Opportunity (FHEO),
Department of Housing and Urban Development. FHEO staff will use the information provided by this form as the basis
for the Department's determination of jurisdiction over a complainants' allegations. 



3. Improved Technology To Reduce Burden



This issue is not applicable to the Section 3 Reporting Form. 

The collection of data on the Section 3 Complaint Form is consistent with the use of improved technology as the Department
prepares to convert their form to a direct electronic input source. This electronic input source will reduce the burden
of completing the form manually before the information is stored on to an electronic media for use in the Department's
automated tracking system. 



4. Duplication 



The Section 3 Reporting Form does not duplicate any other reporting requirement in the Department. 

The Section 3 Complaint Form does not duplicate any other information collection process. HUD is the only Federal
agency with responsibility for administration of Section 3. This form is unique to the processing of a allegation
of noncompliance with the Section 3 statute or implementing regulations. 



5. No Similar Information 



No similar information is available to HUD with respect to the Section 3 Reporting Form.

6. Small Business Burden



The collection of information by the Section 3 Reporting Form involves recipients, contractors, and subcontractors
receiving Federal financial assistance for housing and community development programs covered by Section 3. To
minimize the burden, the Department has attempted to provide clear guidance on the required information collection.
This guidance will prevent the recipient from collecting and submitting unnecessary or duplicative information.
The Section 3 regulations apply to any Public and Indian Housing programs that receive: (1) Development assistance
pursuant to Section 5 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937; (2) operating assistance pursuant to Section 9 of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937; or (3) modernization grants pursuant to Section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The regulations also
apply to other housing and community development assistance expended for: (1) housing rehabilitation (including
reduction and abatement of lead-based paint hazards); (2) housing construction; (3) other public construction
projects; and (4) housing and community development assistance for which the HUD share of the project cost (as defined
in  135.5) for such activity exceeds $100,000, or the amount of any subcontract awarded in connection with the
covered activity exceeds $50,000.

Recipients and contractors subject to Section 3 requirements must maintain appropriate documentation to establish
that, at a minimum, a good faith effort was made to provide economic opportunities resulting from financial assistance
for housing and community development programs to low- and very low-income residents. Each recipient who receives
Section 3 covered assistance from HUD shall submit to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity
an annual report in such form and with such information as the Assistant Secretary may request, for the purpose of determining
the results of Section 3 activities.

These results are used to assess the impact of the law, to target monitoring and compliance reviews, and to prepare
reports to Congress.

A Section 3 complaint may be filed by an individual representing the interests of a small business. The information
required on the Section 3 Complaint Form, is the same type of information voluntarily provided by a person representing
an individual. Complainants are individuals or businesses who chose to submit this form to HUD, and by electing to
do so, are required to only submit it once. No reporting of any kind is required, nor are respondents remunerated by
HUD for this effort.



7. Reporting Cycle



Section 3 Reporting Form information will be collected annually. The report may be submitted on the same cycle as the
performance report required by the program under which Section 3 covered assistance is provided. Where a performance
report is not required, the Section 3 report is due to the local HUD (Category A) Office within ten (10) days after the
end of the reporting period indicated in Block 8 of form HUD-60002 or at the completion of the project if sooner.
Also, an annual reporting cycle will assist HUD in meeting its reporting requirements under Section 808(e)(6) of
the Fair Housing Act, Section 561 of the HCDA of 1987 and Section 916 of the HCDA of 1992. This report also will assist
the Department in evaluating and managing program performance.

The Section 3 Complaint Form mandates no specific requirements with respect to the frequency of collection of information.
The Section 3 Compliant Form is made available to the public for use by individuals or businesses who wish to file a Section
3 compliant with HUD. Complaints are individuals who chose to submit this form to HUD, and by electing to do so, are required
to only submit it once. No remunerated by HUD for this effort.



8. Consistency With 5 CFR 1320.6



Use of the Section 3 Reporting Form is consistent with 24 CFR part 1320.6.

Use of the Section 3 Complaint Form is consistent with 24 CFR part 1320.6.



9. Outside Consultation



Pursuant to statutory requirements, staff from the Departments of Labor and Commerce, and the Small Business Administration
have been contacted regarding the Section 3 Reporting Form. The attached Section 3 Reporting Form_Economic Opportunities
for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons, Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, has been developed by the Section
3 Compliance Division for collecting Section 3 data. Form HUD-2516 is modified to collect Section 3 contracting
data from public and Indian housing programs and all community development programs except those administered by
States. Form HUD-60002 is designed to collect Section 3 contracting data from all other Section 3 covered programs
and to collect training and employment data on all Section 3 covered programs. These data collection forms are the
only instruments that collect Section 3 employment, training and contracting information.

No one was consulted outside the Department with respect to the Section 3 Complaint Form. The instructions are specific,
and the information provided by the complainant is unique on each form.



10. Confidentiality



An assurance of confidentiality is not applicable to the Section 3 Reporting Form. The form will be filed with HUD's
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Privacy Act of 1974 and OMB Circular A-108 are not applicable.

All information collected by the Section 3 Complaint Form complies with the Privacy Act of 1974 and OMB Circular A-108,
``Responsibilities for Maintenance of Records About Individuals by Federal Agencies''. Each respondent is apprised
of the filing of a Section 3 Complaint against them. However, information obtained during the investigation is held
in confidence and may not be divulged while the investigation is in progress.



11. Sensitive Questions



The Section 3 Reporting Form reporting requirements do not contain sensitive questions. The information requested
deals with the results of the recipient's good faith efforts to provide opportunities for lower income residents
to receive job training and employment and for local businesses to receive contracts in connection with HUD assisted
programs. Data is cumulative and personal identifying information is not included.

The Section 3 Complaint Form does not request information of a sensitive nature such as sexual behavior and attitudes,
religious beliefs and other matters that are commonly considered private. Section 3 is racially neutral and as such
the complaint form does not request information regarding the complainants' race, color, sex, or national origin
because these areas are not protected classes or issues which determine beneficiaries of Section 3. The information
provided on this complaint form is given voluntarily and provides the basis for HUD's investigation of the complaint
to determine if the allegations of noncompliance are valid.

13. Estimate of Collection Burden


For the Section 3 Reporting Form the total universe of potential respondents, including recipients, prime contractors
and subcontractors, is approximately 133,403. We anticipate that about 58,403 respondents (HUD recipients) will
submit summary reports to HUD. Prime contractors and subcontractors will submit reports, 

as requested

, to the recipients. The required summary report from the recipients is submitted to HUD annually, 10 days after the
end of the designated reporting period. The information is generated by the recipient through maintaining documentation
that summarizes efforts made, and the results of those efforts, to provide opportunities for training and employment
arising from HUD assistance to low- and very low-income residents. The data will be recorded on the Section 3 reporting
form (form HUD-60002, Economic Opportunities for Low- and Very Low-Income Persons). It is estimated that two
hours per reporting period will be required of the recipients, contractors and subcontractors to prepare the Section
3 report. We estimate that the burden will not vary significantly among the respondents.


Form HUD-60002




For the Section 3 Complaint Form, the Department estimates that during the course of a year approximately 100 Section
3 complaints will be filed. It is anticipated that it will take the complainant approximately one (1) hour to complete
the complaint form. It is anticipated that it will take the respondent approximately four hours to respond to the allegations
of the complaint. Of the 100 complaints anticipated for receipt, HUD does not expect to require or receive a response
from each respondent. About 10% of the complaints received will be administratively closed for lack of jurisdiction
prior to the notification of the respondent. Therefore, the number of responses by the respondent has been lessened
by 10% (to 90 responses) resulting in 360 total response hours for a respondent.
The total number of burden hours for the Section 3 Complaint Form is 460 hours calculated as follows:


Section 3 Complaint Form





14. Change in Burden


The Section 3 Reporting Form is revised to reflect public comments to the proposed rule.
This is the first time that the Section 3 Complaint Form information has been requested.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Institution and scheduling of preliminary antidumping investigations.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of preliminary antidumping investigations Nos. 731-TA-700-701
(Preliminary) under section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)) to determine whether there is a reasonable
indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or
the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from the People's
Republic of China and Thailand of disposable pocket lighters, gas fueled, non-refillable, provided for in subheading
9613.10.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to be sold in the United States
at less than fair value. The Commission must complete preliminary antidumping investigations in 45 days, or in this
case by June 23, 1994. 



For further information concerning the conduct of these investigations and rules of general application, consult
the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts
A and B (19 CFR part 207). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background



These investigations are being instituted in response to a petition filed on May 9, 1994, by BIC Corporation, Milford,
CT. 



Participation in the Investigations and Public Service List



Persons (other than petitioners) wishing to participate in the investigations as parties must file an entry of appearance
with the Secretary to the Commission, as provided in   201.11 and 207.10 of the Commission's rules, not
later than seven (7) days after publication of this notice in the

Decree, The Albany-Dougherty Payroll Development Authority has agreed to provide access to the Site, record deed
restrictions, and impose institutional controls on the Site.

1992 and 1993 Digital Audio Recording Royalty Funds; Motions and Objections 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Copyright Office, Library of Congress. 

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of time period to file motions and objections. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office is giving notice to the claimants to the 1992 and 1993 Digital Audio Recording Royalty Funds of
the commencement of a 30-day period to file any precontroversy motions or objections. This includes any objections
for cause to the arbitrators nominated by various professional arbitration associations. 

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 9, 1994, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress published in the 

Federal Register

 the interim regulations that govern the distribution and ratemaking proceedings conducted by the Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panels (CARP), as specified by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993. 59 FR 23964 (May 9, 1994).



Section 251.45 of these interim regulations provides that, before the initiation of any CARP royalty distribution
proceeding, the Librarian of Congress will ``designate a 30-day period in which any party to the proceeding may file
with the Librarian of Congress objections to, or motions to dismiss, any party's royalty claim, or motions for declaratory
rulings, or for procedural or evidentiary rulings, on any proper ground.'' 
At the same time,  251.4 of the CARP rules provides that, during this same 30-day period, ``any party to the proceeding
may * * * file an objection with the Librarian of Congress to one or more of the persons contained on the
arbitrator list for the proceeding. Such objection shall plainly state the grounds and reasons for each person claimed
to be objectionable.'' 
We are currently anticipating that a CARP proceeding may be required for the distribution of 1992 and 1993 digital
audio recording royalties (DART). On March 1, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice asking the claimants to those two funds whether any controversies exist, and requested their filing of a notice
of intention to participate. We stated that, if controversies do exist, we would initiate the proceeding on June 30,
1994. 59 FR 9773 (Mar. 1, 1994). 


Precontroversy motion and objection period for 1992 and 1993 DART. 

Therefore, by this Notice, we are establishing the 30-day precontroversy period called for by   251.4
and 251.45 for the filing of precontroversy motions and objections, and for the filing of objections to the list of
arbitrators nominated by professional arbitration association. The precontroversy motion and objection period
begins today and ends June 15, 1994. 
The list of nominated arbitrators was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1994, and is available, with accompanying supporting materials, by contacting the Office of the General
Counsel, Copyright Office. 59 FR 23964 (May, 9, 1994). 


Other matters. 

In our March 1, 1994, notice, we asked whether the claimants wanted to file a motion for consolidation of the 1992 and
1993 DART distribution proceedings. We requested comments by June 10, 1994. Although a motion for consolidation
is typical of the types of motions for which the 30-day precontroversy period (ending on June 15, 1994) is designed,
we have already set the deadline for the motion for consolidation as June 10, 1994, and we are not changing that slightly
earlier deadline by our action today. 


Handling of precontroversy motions and objections. 

For any precontroversy motion or objection, the Librarian of Congress has discretion either to rule on it or to refer
it to the CARP panel. See,  251.45(b). As explained in our preamble to the interim CARP regulations issued on
May 9, 1994, we have decided that, unlike the situation with respect to precontroversy motions and objections, there
is no practical way to allow for precontroversy discovery under the statute. Thus, any motion that is in the nature
of precontroversy discovery will be referred by the Librarian to the CARP panel to be handled during the controversy.
See, 59 FR 23964, 23977 (May 9, 1994). 
For any objection to one or more listed arbitrators, the Librarian will take into account the objection as part of the
entire consideration of each nominee at the time he is required to select two arbitrators for the proceeding. The mere
filing of an objection will not, in and of itself disqualify an arbitrator or, without supporting reasons, diminish
the person's chances of being selected. As we have said earlier, peremptory challenges will not be allowed, and all
objections must be fully substantiated. See, 59 FR 2550, 2552 (Jan. 18, 1994); 59 FR 23964, 23969 (May 9, 1994).

deficiency with respect to its current licensing basis; (3) the NRC deny all requests for license amendments for the
expansion of spent fuel pool capacity until these safety concerns are fully resolved; and (4) after evaluation by
each licensee, if the NRC determines there is little or no risk to the public health and safety, the NRC may issue a Notice
of Enforcement Discretion.

As bases for his request, the Petitioner asserts that the NRC was informed approximately one and one-half years ago
of a potential substantial nuclear safety hazard at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station and the NRC has intentionally
withheld this information from other utilities. According to the Petitioner, this hazard involves a major design
flaw such that during a design basis loss of coolant accident, the electrical power to the fuel pool cooling system
would be turned off, resulting in loss of cooling for the spent fuel pool. The Petitioner alleges that radiation levels
in the reactor building would prohibit operators from entering the reactor building to restart the system. According
to the Petitioner, if cooling is not restored, the water in the spent fuel pool will boil, water will evaporate and,
since the valves which must be opened to provide replacement water are within the inaccessible reactor building,
replacement water cannot be provided, resulting in high onsite and offsite radiation levels and a meltdown of the
spent fuel in the pool resulting in release of massive amounts of airborne radioactivity outside of primary and secondary
containment. The Petitioner alleges further that the residual heat removal system could not cool the fuel pool under
accident conditions, and that if replacement water could be provided, the temperature and humidity conditions would
be generated in the reactor building which would cause the emergency systems to fail, resulting in additional meltdown
and failure of the primary and secondary containment.

The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. By letter dated May 5, 1994, the Petitioner's request
for immediate action has been denied.

A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW. (lower
level), Washington, DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>UMETCO Minerals Corporation Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision</DOCTITLE>


Notice is hereby given that by Petition dated January 13, 1994, Thomas W. Clawson, on behalf of Envirocare of Utah,
Inc. (Petitioner), requested that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) hold an informal hearing concerning
the August 2, 1993, approval of an amendment to Umetco Minerals Corporation's (Umetco) materials license pursuant
to 10 CFR 2.1205 and institute pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 a proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Umetco's materials
license, pending the preparation of either an environmental assessment pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) or an environmental report under 10 CFR 51.60, and while a determination is made whether the
amended license complies with controlling Commission rules and with the standards promulgated by the Environmental
Protection Agency, as required under 42 U.S.C.A. 2114(a)(2).
As basis for the request, the Petitioner asserts that the Commission has allowed Umetco to convert the White Mesa Mill
facility into a major commercial byproduct materials disposal facility without a current environmental analysis
in violation of NEPA and the Commission's environmental regulations and which does not have to comply with current
environmental protection standards.
By Memorandum and Order of the Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board dated March 4, 1994, the Petitioner's
request for an informal hearing pursuant to 10 CFR 2.1205 was denied. Accordingly, the Petitioner's request is being
treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred to the Director of
the Office of Nuclear Materials Safety and Safeguards. As provided by  2.206, appropriate action will be taken
on this request within a reasonable period of time.
A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Co., Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License
and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the
Haddam Neck Plant located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.

The proposed amendment would modify the pressure temperature limit curves of Technical Specification 3/4.4.9,
``Pressure/Temperature Limits, Reactor Coolant System,'' Figures 3.4-3, 4, and 5 and the associated Bases
section.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By June 15, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut
06457. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave in intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford,
Connecticut 06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petition and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer of the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards consideration in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated April 7, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown, Connecticut

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Permanent Approval of the Pilot Program Involving Debit Put Spreads in Broad-Based Indexes With European-Style
Exercise</DOCTITLE>





May 9, 1994.




On December 27, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(10 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 proposed rule change seeking permanent approval of Exchange Rule 24.11A, ``Debit Put Spread Cash Account Transactions,''
which establishes a pilot program allowing approved public customers with qualified portfolios (``spread exemption
customers'') to effect and maintain in cash accounts debit put spread transactions in broad-based index options
with European-style exercise.











The proposed rule change was published in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33407 (December 30, 1993), 59 FR 1041.
No comments were received on the proposed rule change.





Currently,  220.8 of Regulation T under the Act precludes customers from effecting spread transactions in
cash accounts. Specifically,  220.8(a)(3)(ii) of Regulation T includes in permissible cash account transactions
a creditor's issue, endorsement or guarantee of a put option for a customer if the creditor obtains cash in an amount
equal to the exercise price of the option or holds in the account any of the following instruments with a current market
value at least equal to the exercise price of the option and with one year or less to maturity: U.S. government securities,
negotiable bank certificates of deposit, or bankers acceptance issued by a U.S. bank and payable in the United States.
Because offsetting option positions fail to satisfy these criteria, spreads are not included in permissible cash
account transactions and therefore must be effected in margin accounts.




On November 26, 1991, the Commission approved proposals submitted by the CBOE and the Amex which established one year
pilot programs allowing approved public customers
 with qualified portfolios of stock to effect and maintain in cash accounts debit put spread transactions in broad-based
index options with European-style exercise.
 The Commission approved proposals extending the CBOE's pilot program through December 31, 1993, and, most recently,
through December 31, 1994.








The pilot program defines a ``debit put spread'' as ``a long put position coupled with a short put position overlying
the same broad-based index and having an equivalent underlying aggregate index value, where the short put(s) expires
with the long put(s), and the strike price of the long put(s) exceeds the strike price of the short put(s).'' Under the
terms of the pilot, only public customers approved by the CBOE are permitted to participate in the pilot program. To
obtain the CBOE's approval, customers are required, among other things, to hold a qualified stock portfolio or its
equivalent that is composed of net long positions in common stocks in at least four industry groups and that contains
at least twenty stocks, none of which accounts for more than fifteen percent of the value of the portfolio. A portfolio
must meet these standards at all times, regardless of trading activity in the stocks. In addition, the debit put spread
positions must be carried in an account with an Exchange member organization and the qualified portfolio must be maintained
with either an Exchange member organization, another broker-dealer, a bank, or a securities depository.





In conjunction with the creation of the pilot program, the Commission staff also issued no-action letters to the Amex
and the CBOE stating the staff would not recommend enforcement action against the Amex and the CBOE due to the operation
of the pilot program, namely the maintenance of spread positions in a cash account.
 The staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board'') also informed the Commission staff that
Board staff would not object to the Commission staff's issuance of these no-action positions in connection with the
pilot programs.
 Most recently, Board staff indicated that it would not raise objections to permanent approval of the pilot program.

As required by the Debit Put Spread Approval Order, the CBOE submitted a report assessing the effectiveness of the
pilot program.
 In addition, as required under the Pilot Extension Order, the CBOE has submitted a report dated as of November 10, 1993,
assessing the effectiveness of the pilot program from January 1993 through September 1993.
 In its 1993 Pilot Report, the CBOE states that no participant has operated in violation of the pilot since its inception.
As it concluded in its initial Pilot Report, the CBOE states that the pilot program has provided an efficient means
for investors who are limited to cash account transactions to effectively hedge their portfolios against market
declines. The CBOE states that it has neither experienced or detected any problems related to the pilot program and,
in addition, that no activity of any participant appeared to violate the requirements of the pilot program or other
Exchange Rules. The Exchange has found no evidence of market manipulation or other negative impact on market operations
arising from the pilot program.





The Commission finds that the proposal to grant permanent approval to the debit pub spread pilot program is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange,
and, in particular, the requirements of section 6.
 Specifically, the Commission believes, as it has concluded previously,
 that the pilot program is designed to benefit qualified public customers who are prohibited or restricted in their
use of margin accounts by facilitating their purchase of index option debit put spreads. Because the purchaser of
a debit put spread uses the call premium to reduce the cost of purchasing the put, index option pub spreads provide investors
with an affordable means to hedge their portfolios against adverse market moves. In addition, to the extent that the
pilot program has increased index options transactions, the program has benefitted all options investors by contributing
to the depth and liquidity of the CBOE's options markets.







The Commission continues to believe that the economic characteristics of index option debit put spreads permit an
exception to the application of Regulation T. In a debit put spread, the long put entitles the spread exemption customer
to receive payment when the index reaches the pub option's strike price; because the strike price of the long put must
exceed the strike price of the short put, the spread exemption customer's right to receive payment under the long put
will offset any obligations he incurs from the sale of the short put. Because the short position must expire with the
long position, the offset provided by the long put will last for the duration of the spread exemption customer's obligation
as a short put writer. In addition, there is no risk that the short put will be exercised prior to the long put because
the exemption applies solely to European-style options, which may be exercised only during a specified period prior
to expiration.
In its 1993 Pilot Report, the CBOE states that no participant has operated in violation of the pilot since its inception,
nor have the CBOE's surveillance procedures revealed evidence of manipulation or abuse of knowledge of impending
expiration-related program trades for each expiration Friday during the review period. The 1993 Pilot Report indicates
that the pilot program's 39 participants included corporations, pension/retirement plans, non-profit organizations,
mutual funds, and individual or family trusts, the majority of which were prohibited by contractual agreements from
using margin accounts. The debit put spreads of all of the participants were comprised of Standard & Poor's (``S&P'')
500 Index (``SPX'') options with one to four months remaining until expiration. During the review period the total
number of spreads effected on a monthly basis under the pilot program each month ranged from 3,696 to 12,544.
On the basis of the 1993 Pilot Report, the Commission believes that the debit put spread pilot program has facilitated
that needs of qualified public customers who are limited to cash account transactions by providing them with an effective
means to hedge their portfolios against adverse market moves. At the same time, the 1993 Pilot Report indicates that
no pilot participant has violated the pilot's parameters, nor has the Exchange discovered any market manipulation
or abuse in connection with the pilot program.
 In addition, the Commission has received no comments regarding the operation of the pilot program, and Board staff
has raised no objection to permanent approval of the pilot program.
 For these reasons, the Commission believes that the debit put spread pilot program has provided qualified public
customers with additional means to implement their hedging strategies and, by facilitating index options transactions,
has benefitted all options investors by contributing to the depth and liquidity of the CBOE's options markets.







It is therefore ordered, 

pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-60) granting permanent approval to the CBOE's debit
put spread program is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule
Change Relating to Conflicts of Interest in the Distribution of Securities</DOCTITLE>



May 10, 1994.



On November 12, 1992, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section

II. Background



Schedule E addresses potential conflicts of interest that arise when a member participates in the public distribution
of its own securities or the securities of an affiliate. The standards for determining affiliation under Schedule
E are voting control through ownership of equity securities, or common control of management through interlocking
officerships or directorships. Where such conflicts exist, and absent an investment grade rating for debt securities
or a bona fide independent market for equity securities, Schedule E requires a qualified independent underwriter
to render an opinion on the offering price of the securities, conduct due diligence, and participate in the preparation
of the registration statement. The qualified independent underwriter also assumes underwriter's liability for
the offering. The NASD relies on the objectivity and independence of the qualified independent underwriter to resolve
the conflicts of interest present when a member distributes its own securities or those of an affiliate. 

After discussions with several member firms and a review of numerous leveraged buy-out offerings, the NASD determined
that a potential conflict of interest arises when a member engaged in an offering of the issuer's securities owns subordinated
debt, voting or non-voting equity of the issuer. The NASD is concerned about these offerings because members and their
affiliates often become holders of subordinated debt or non-voting equity as a result of their participation in leveraged
buy-out transactions, which could influence the independence of members' pricing and due diligence functions in
any subsequent related public offering. The proposed rule change addresses these potential conflicts by extending
Schedule E to situations in which a member participating in a public offering of debt or equity securities owns debt,
preferred equity, or non-voting common equity of the issuer.



III. The Proposal



The rule change prohibits members and their associated persons from participating in the distribution of a public
offering of securities if the member and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates have a conflict of interest
with the issuer. For purposes of the rule change, a ``conflict of interest'' would be presumed to exist if the member
and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own 10% or more of the outstanding
subordinated debt,
 common equity,
 or preferred equity
 of the issuer. In addition, a ``conflict of interest'' would exist if the member and/or its associated persons, parent,
or affiliates beneficially owns a general, limited, or special partnership interest in 10% or more of the distributable
profits or losses of the issuer.







The calculation of the 10% threshold would be based on all securities of the issuer beneficially owned by the member
at the time of the filing of the offering documents, including proprietary trading accounts and other fluctuating
positions, regardless of whether any of the securities are sold prior to effectiveness of the offering. With respect
to the ownership of subordinated debt, the calculation of the threshold would be based on the issuer's entire subordinated
debt outstanding_not just the issue owned by the member.

The rule change exempts (1) offerings by not-for-profit and charitable organizations; (2) investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (3) ``separate accounts'' as defined in the Investment Company
Act of 1940; (4) real estate investment trusts; (5) direct participation programs; (6) financing-instrument-backed
securities which are rated investment grade; (7) equity securities for which a bona fide independent market exists;
and (8) debt securities rated investment grade.






The rule change would also require disclosure of the conflict of interest in the offering document. The provision
currently requires that the offering document disclose (i) that the offering is being made pursuant to the provisions
of Schedule E; and (ii) the name of the qualified independent underwriter, and that such member is acting as a qualified
independent underwriter. In the case of an offering subject to the conflict of interest provisions, Schedule E would
require disclosure that the member or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates own the common stock, preferred
stock, or subordinated debt of the company.

Finally, the rule change provides an exception from the QIU pricing requirements of Schedule E in recapitalizations
or restructurings for a member who is acting solely as financial advisor but is otherwise subject to Schedule E because
of a conflict of interest or because the member is participating in offerings of securities of an affiliate. The NASD
believes that the more limited functions of the member acting as a financial advisor would not require the qualified
independent underwriter to provide a pricing opinion where the financial advisor does not participate in the pricing
opinion. The exception would not be available in the context of an offering by a member of its own securities or those
of its parent.



IV. Comments



The Commission receive one letter opposing the rule change from the Securities Industry Association (``SIA'').
 The NASD responded to these comments in Amendment No. 4. The SIA's comments and the NASD's responses are discussed
below.





The SIA argues that ownership of an issuer's debt or non-voting equity securities does not demonstrate a conflict
of interest requiring regulation under Schedule E. The SIA recognizes the NASD's concern that an underwriter could
obtain practical control of an issuer through holding a substantial amount of debt securities with ``equity-type
control powers.'' Nevertheless, the SIA argues, the concept of control in Schedule E is sufficiently broad to cover
the situation where an underwriter obtains practical control through holding a substantial amount of debt securities
with ``equity-type control powers.''

<DOCNO> FR940516-2-00108 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940516-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD responds that it has identified situations in which a member's ownership of the issuer's debt or non-voting
equity results in the absence of an arm's-length bargaining relationship, potentially compromising due diligence,
disclosure, and pricing. Furthermore, the NASD disagrees that the concept of control in Schedule E is sufficiently
broad to cover a situation where an underwriter might obtain practical control through holding a substantial amount
of debt securities with ``equity-type control powers.'' The NASD is not aware of any situations in which the NASD staff
has based a determination of ``control'' on debt ownership, nor does it believe it can distinguish debt securities
with ``equity-type control powers.''

The SIA argues further that disclosure in the offering document of a significant relationship between the issuer
and the underwriter should be sufficient to address such potential conflicts of interest. The NASD responds that
it relies on a number of standards of fair practice, including disclosure, to ensure the independence of members participating
in offerings. The NASD does not believe that disclosure of a conflict, by itself, is sufficient to address the effects
to the conflict.


The SIA also notes that concerns about conflicts arising from an underwriter's ownership of issuers' debt and non-voting
equity arose as a result of the prevalence of leveraged buy-outs and bridge loans in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The SIA points out that these transactions are no longer prevalent, and argues that the rule change should be postponed
until these transactions again become prevalent. The NASD, however, believes that a member's debt or non-voting
equity interest in an issuer can present a conflict regardless of the structure of the transaction. The NASD notes
that recently, companies once subject to leveraged buy-outs are now de-leveraging by issuing equity. In these situations,
the member, who served as financial advisor and acquired subordinated debt in the buy-out, may now serve as lead manager
of the equity offering. The NASD believes that these situations raise potential conflicts that warrant the protections
of Schedule E.


Finally, the SIA argues that the 10% member ownership threshold for determining whether there is a potential conflict
should not apply to the member's holdings in an individual class of securities but rather, to the member's combined
securities holdings in the issuer.
 For example, under the SIA's approach, a member with a 10% interest in the issuer's subordinated debt would not have
a conflict of interest if its interest in all other classes of the issuer's securities including voting and non-voting
equity, does not rise to the 10% threshold. The NASD responds that it considered this approach but determined that
the potential conflict of interest occurs in connection with significant ownership of securities within an individual
class.





V. Discussion




The Commission has considered the above comments and has determined to approve the NASD's proposed rule change. The
Commission recognizes the NASD's obligation to ensure the objectivity and independence of members participating
in a securities offering. Furthermore, the Commission recognizes that a member's holdings of subordinated debt
or non-voting equity could influence the independence of the member's pricing and due diligence functions in a subsequent
offering of the issuer's securities. The Commission believes that the absence of an arms-length bargaining relationship
in these transactions potentially compromises due diligence, disclosure, and pricing.


Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to extend the requirements of Schedule E to situations
in which a member participating in a public offering owns debt or non-voting equity of the issuer.
 The Commission does not believe that disclosure of the member's interest in the issuer, by itself, is sufficient to
address the potential conflict of interest that arises when a member holds a substantial interest in the debt or non-voting
equity of an issuer. Rather, the Commission believes that the additional protections provided under Schedule E_including
a pricing opinion and due diligence by a qualified independent underwriter_are necessary to address these potential
conflicts.





Finally, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to provide an exception from the QIU pricing requirements
of Schedule E in recapitalizations or restructurings for members who are otherwise subject to Schedule E but are acting
solely as financial advisors. The Commission understands that in these transactions, the member acting as financial
advisor would not be participating in the pricing opinion. Consequently, it appears that in recapitalizations or
retructurings in which the conflicted financial advisor does not participate in the pricing of the offering, an exception
from the Schedule E qualified independent underwriter pricing opinion would not reduce investor protections.


For these reasons, and for the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular,
the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the NASD's rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to
foster cooperation and coordination with person engaged in regulating, clearing and settling, processing information
with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change will prevent manipulative acts and practices, promote just
and equitable principles of trade, and otherwise protect the public interest in connection with offerings in which
a member and/or its associated persons, parent, or affiliates may have a conflict of interest with the issuer.





It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the 
proposed rule change SR-NASD-92-46 be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Interpretation to Rule 345 Establishing a New Category of Limited Registration for Floor Clerks of Members and
the Content Outline for the Examination Module for Floor Clerks of Members Engaged in Public Business With Professional
Customers (Series 7B) </DOCTITLE>



May 10, 1994. 



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder
 notice is hereby given that on March 28, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization (``SRO''). The Commission
is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the propose rule change from interested persons. 






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The Exchange has filed a proposed interpretation to Rule 345 establishing a new category of limited registration
for floor clerks of members engaged in public business with professional customers and the Content Outline for the
Examination Module for Floor Clerks of Members Engaged in Public Business with Professional Customers (Series B).
The Exchange also seeks approval of the Series 7B examination module. 


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




(a) Purpose 



Recently, the Exchange established a new category of registration and developed a qualification examination module
(Qualification Examination for Floor Members Engaged in Public Business with Professional Customers_Series 7A)
for floor members who conduct a public business limited to accepting orders from professional customers for execution
on the trading floor.
 This Series 7A examination module, developed as a subset of the General Securities Registered Representative Examination
(``Series 7''), was created because the level of knowledge required to perform the activities engaged in by members
who conduct a professional public business limited to transactions in listed securities on the Exchange floor is
narrower in content and scope than that needed to conduct an overall general securities business with retail customers.






Currently, floor clerks associated with members and who take orders from public customers must become registered
representatives and pass the Series 7 examination. Floor members who conduct a public business limited to dealing
with professional customers (who may satisfy the Series 7A exam requirements in lieu of the Series 7) have requested
that their floor clerks who take orders solely from professional customers also be allowed to take a qualifying examination
more appropriate to the level of knowledge required to serve professional customers. 

The Exchange will continue to require the successful completion of the Series 7 examination for any floor clerk seeking
to become a registered representative dealing with other than professional customers. In addition, any person who
has successfully completed the Series 7 examination will not be required to complete the Series 7B examination. 

Since the Series 7A exam was developed for members, it assumes the member's level of qualification (

i.e.

, completion of new member orientation program and/or having passed the floor member qualification examination_Series
15). Consequently, the Series 7B examination module has been developed to test the knowledge of floor clerks who accept
orders only from professional customers on behalf of members qualified to conduct business with these professional
customers by complementing the Series 7A examination module with questions on basic information required to perform
floor functions. 

A committee of floor member representatives in conjunction with the Exchange staff developed the content outline,
which details the coverage of the examination module, as well as the actual examination. The committee and staff identified
the knowledge areas associated with the job tasks, determined the relative emphasis to be given across the knowledge
areas, reviewed examination questions and forms, and determined the passing score. 

The proposed interpretation to rule 345.15 establishes a new category of registration, limited registration for
floor clerks, and requires that those who conduct a public business limited to accepting orders directly from professional
customers for execution on the trading floor, successfully complete the Series 7B examination.

<TEXT>
 

(b) Statutory Basis



The statutory basis for the Series 7B Exam lies in section 6(c)(3)(B) of the Act. Under that section, the Exchange may
bar a natural person from becoming a member or person associated with a member, if such natural person does not meet
such standards of training, experience and competence as are prescribed by the rules of the Exchange. Pursuant to
this statutory obligation, the Exchange has developed examinations that are administered to establish that Exchange
floor members and persons associated with such members performing specific functions have attained specific levels
of competence and knowledge.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or 

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies
of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-13 and should be submitted by June 6, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Listing of Warrants Based on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index</DOCTITLE>



May 10, 1994.



On December 10, 1990, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to list warrants based on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index (``FT-SE 100''
or ``Index''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on January 7, 1991.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal.







The Exchange proposes to list index warrants based on the FT-SE 100, a broad-based, internationally recognized,
capitalization-weighted stock index based on the prices of 100 of the most highly capitalized and actively traded
stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'').

The Commission has previously approved the listing of FT-SE 100 warrants by other self-regulatory organizations
(``SROs'').
 The PHLX will list FT-SE 100 warrants consistent with the standards set forth in the FT-SE 100 Warrant Approval
Orders. Specifically, trading in FT-SE 100 warrants will be subject to Exchange Rule 1026 (Suitability), which
applies the options suitability standard to index warrant recommendations made by members and member organizations,
and to Exchange Rule 1027 (Discretionary Accounts), which requires that a Senior Registered Options Principal or
Registered Options Principal approve and initial any discretionary index warrant transaction on the day it is executed.
In addition, Exchange Rule 747 (Approval of Accounts), which requires that member organizations obtain certain
approvals prior to making brokerage transactions for customer accounts, shall apply to trading FT-SE 100 warrants.
Finally, the Exchange will also distribute a circular regarding suitability requirements to its membership.





Further, consistent with the proposals set forth and approved in the FT-SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders, FT-SE
100 warrants may be American-style
 or European-style,
 and may have a term of one to five years. Additionally, (1) issuers must exceed the Exchange's financial listing criteria
and have assets in excess of $100 million, (2) the warrants must have a minimum public distribution of one million warrants
with a minimum of 400 public warrant holders, and (3) the warrants must have an aggregate market value of at least $4
million.






The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, for the reasons stated in the FT-SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders, the Commission believes FT-SE
100 warrants may provide a valuable hedging vehicle for investors, allowing them to hedge against stock market fluctuations
in the United Kingdom.
 Additionally, the Commission notes the PHLX is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'')
 and that the LSE is an affiliate member of the ISG. As an affiliate member, the LSE has agreed to provide certain information
to other ISG members, including the PHLX, upon request.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes the LSE's affiliate membership in the ISG helps to ensure the effectiveness
of an information sharing arrangement that will assist the PHLX in its surveillance of trading in FT-SE 100 warrants.
Finally, the Commission notes that other U.S. SROs have listed FT-SE 100 warrants pursuant to the FT-SE
100 Warrant Approval Orders for several years and the Commission is not currently aware of any prior or existing problems
regarding the listing and trading of these warrants. Based on the above, the Commission finds that the Exchange's
proposal to list FT-SE 100 warrants as described herein is consistent with just and equitable principles of
trade and the protection of investors.








It is Therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHLX-90-35) is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Excessive Trading</DOCTITLE>


May 9, 1994.


On December 30, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend PHLX Rule 1015, ``Excessive Dealing in Options,'' to delete the phrase ``in view of
his financial resources'' from the rule and to renumber the rule as PHLX Rule 1021.





The proposed rule change was noticed for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33804 (March 22, 1994), 59
FR 14699 (March 29, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.





Currently, PHLX Rule 1015, ``Excessive Dealing in Options,'' prohibits a member from effecting purchases or sales
in options which are excessive in view of his financial resources or in view of the market for such security. The PHLX
proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1015 by deleting the phrase ``in view of his financial resources'' and by renumbering the
rule as PHLX Rule 1021. The PHLX proposes to delete the reference to the financial resources of a member from current
PHLX Rule 1015 because this phrase is already appropriately included in Exchange Rule 771, ``Excessive Trading of
Members.''
 The PHLX indicates that the financial responsibility reference included in the trade practice rule (PHLX Rule 1015)
was recently the source of confusion, which will be corrected by the PHLX's proposal. Specifically, under the proposed
rule change, PHLX Rule 771 will govern the financial aspect of excessive options trading and PHLX Rule 1021 will govern
the trade practice aspect of excessive options trading.







The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular
with section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, as well as
to protect investors and the public interest.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to protect investors and the public interest.
 specifically, the proposal will help to clarify the PHLX's rules by deleting the phrase ``in view of his financial
resources'' from PHLX Rule 1015, so that PHLX Rule 1015 will apply solely to the trade practice aspect of excessive
options trading and PHLX Rule 771 will apply to the financial aspect of excessive options trading. In its proposal,
the PHLX states that the financial responsibility reference in PHLX Rule 1015 has been a source of confusion. Because
PHLX Rule 771, which applies to both equities and options, contains the same financial responsibility provision
as that provided currently in PHLX Rule 1015, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the PHLX to delete the
redundant financial responsibility reference in PHLX Rule 1015 in order to eliminate confusion. Because PHLX Rule
771 applies to both equities and options, the proposal to delete the financial responsibility reference from PHLX
Rule 1015 will clarify PHLX Rule 1015 without affecting the substance of the PHLX's prohibition of excessive options
trading. In addition, the Commission believes that the increased clarity of PHLX Rule 1015 will help to facilitate
compliance with the rule.




It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHLX-93-51) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

$0.25 Par Value) File No. 1-11003</DOCTITLE>



May 10, 1994.



Unimed, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on May 2, 1994,

of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS'') and does not wish to be dually
listed. During 1993, the trading volume on the CHX was zero.

Any interested person may, on or before June 1, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Sunstates Corporation, Common
Stock, $0.331/3 Par Value; $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock, $25 Par Value) File No. 1-5300</DOCTITLE>



May 10, 1994.



Sunstates Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved a resolution on January 20,
1994, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock and Preferred Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common
Stock and Preferred Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market
Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS'').

The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market makers will result in increased visibility and
sponsorship for its Common Stock and $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist
on the Amex.

The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's shareholders a broader market, greater
liquidity and less volatility in quoted prices per share than is presently available on the Amex.

The Company believes that the firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock and $3.75 Cumulative Preferred Stock
on the NASDAQ/NMS system will also be inclined to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing
the number of firms providing research and advisory reports.

Any interested person may, on or before June 1, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue and order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Polestar Capital, Inc.; Issuance of a Small Business Investment Company License</DOCTITLE>



On March 23, 1994, a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 13755) stating that an application has been filed by Polestar Capital, Inc., 200 Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois
60601, with the Small Business Administration (SBA) pursuant to Section 107.102 of the Regulations governing small
business investment companies (13 CFR 107.102 (1994)) for a Transfer of Ownership and Control and Capital Reorganization
of Amoco Venture Capital Company.

Interested parties were given until close of business April 22, 1994 to submit their comments to SBA. No comments were
received. 

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, after
having considered the application and all other pertinent information, SBA has approved the Transfer of Ownership
and Control and Capital Reorganization of Polestar Capital, Inc., under the following terms and conditions, effective
April 29, 1994.

(1) At this time, subject to number two (2) below and current regulations, your application does not address the 3 percent
Preferred Stock Buy Back Program or the Preferential Payment Distribution to Amoco Corporation (``AMOCO'').

(2) No distributions, including the Preferential Payment Distribution, could be made to any shareholder or Amoco
without full repayment of the accrued dividends outstanding owed to the Small Business Administration (``SBA'')
for your outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock. Provided that Polestar Capital, Inc. (``PCI'') is in compliance
with SBA regulations, after the payment of the accrued but unpaid dividends owed to SBA, then PCI could make distributions
to other shareholders and to Amoco as long as PCI had the ability to make additional distributions in compliance with
all SBA regulations.

(3) Once the final regulations were completed for the Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would be eligible to apply under
the then current existing regulations. PCI could not request terms or conditions that were utilized in the pilot program,
if such conditions have been changed for the final program. Amoco Corporation has indicated that they do not desire
and would not apply for the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back Program prior to the actual change of ownership and control.
For the purposes of the 3 percent Preferred Stock Buy Back, PCI would agree that it could not claim distressed status
under the Buy Back regulations.

(4) Any future sale or conversion of a controlling interest (50 percent or more of the common stock) of the common stock
of PCI would continue to be subordinated to the accrued but unpaid interest and principal of the Small Business Administration's
(``SBA'') outstanding 3 percent Preferred Stock, and would require under existing regulation SBA's prior approval.

Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to OMB for Review



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

The Department of State has resubmitted the following public information collection requirement to OMB for review
and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Public Law 103-94, effective February 3, 1994, authorized the garnishment of salary of Federal employees for
unpaid debts. Under Executive Order 12897, the Office of Personnel Management was delegated authority to promulgate
regulations to implement the commercial garnishment provisions in section 9 of that law. OPM has issued interim regulations
which, among other things, specify the ``minimally required'' information to accompany legal process (5 CFR 582.203).
The law also requires that priority be given and special treatment be provided for garnishments for child support
and alimony under 42 U.S.C. 659, 661, and 662. The information proposed to be collected on the Department of State form
DS-1932 includes the minimally required information and facilitates differentiation between commercial
garnishments and those for child support or alimony. The following summarizes the information collection proposal
submitted to OMB:




Type of request_New collection
Originating office_Bureau of Legal Affairs
Title of information collection_U.S. Department of State Garnishment Application
Form No._DS-1932
Frequency_On occasion
Respondents_Parties seeking garnishment of employees' salary
Estimated number of respondents_500
Average hours per response_15 minutes
Total estimated burden hours_125




44 U.S.C. 3504(h) does not apply, as no rulemaking is being conducted in connection with this information collection.




ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR COMMENTS: 

Copies of the proposed forms and supporting documents may be obtained from Gail J. Cook, (202) 647-3538. Comments

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Noise Compatibility Program Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Gulfport, MS</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Authority under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal
and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On May 21, 1993, the FAA determined that
the noise exposure maps submitted by Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Authority under part 150 were in compliance
with applicable requirements. On April 1, 1994, the Administrator approved the Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport
noise compatibility program. Most of the recommendations of the program were approved. No program element relating
to new or revised flight procedures for noise abatement were proposed by the airport operator. The Gulfport-Biloxi
Regional Airport Authority has also requested under part 150,  150.35(f), that FAA determine that revised
noise exposure maps, submitted with the noise compatibility program and showing noise contours as a result of the
implementation of the noise compatibility program, are in compliance with applicable requirements of FAR part 150.
The FAA announces its determination that the revised noise exposure maps for the Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport
for years 1992 and 1997, submitted with the noise compatibility program, are in compliance with applicable requirements
of FAR Part 150 effective April 1, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Gulfport-Biloxi
Regional Airport, effective April 1, 1994, and that revised noise exposure maps for this same airport are determined
to be in compliance with applicable requirements of FAR Part 150.



A. Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

1. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;

2. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

3. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and 

4. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Jackson, Mississippi.

Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on October 16, 1991, the noise exposure maps, descriptions,
and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from October 16, 1991,
through October 5, 1993. The Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in
compliance with applicable requirements on May 21, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 7, 1993.

The Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions
designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion
to the year 1997. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program
as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 5, 1993, and was required
by a provision of the Act of approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program.

The submitted program contained proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed its
review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied.
The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Administrator effective April 1, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for 2 noise abatement actions, 3 remedial land use strategies, 6 preventive land use
strategies, and 5 implementation measures of the specific program elements.



Noise Abatement Actions



1. 

Construct 1500' runway extension

 at the north end of Runway 13/31 with a displacement of the Runway 13 landing threshold to maintain current threshold
position.

2. 

Establish Preferential North Flow

 runway use which maximizes operations on Runway 31, consistent with wind, weather, traffic and other operating conditions
as an informal runway use program.



Land Use Strategies





Remedial.

 It is recommended that, at the discretion of the Airport Authority, the implementation program for alleviating incompatibilities
within the 70-75 DNL contour be continued by the Airport Authority rather than the land owner (as is the case for
the 65-70 DNL contour)

1. 

Acquisition in Fee Simple.

 39 mobile homes in the 65-70 DNL contour. In the 70-75 DNL contour, there are 13 mobile homes recommended
for voluntary acquisition. In the DNL 75+ contour, fee simple, voluntary acquisition of two residential structures
is recommended.

2. 

Acquisition of Avigation Easements.

 In exchange for sound attenuation (item 3, below) the conveyance of an avigation easement to the airport authority
would be required. For those homes now participating in the sound attenuation program (and for some mobile homes (see
item 1, above)), it is recommended that avigation easements be acquired. In addition, the Airport Authority should
request that an avigation easement be provided if any change in zoning or land use is proposed (from compatible to noncompatible).

3. 

Sound Attenuation.

 In the 65-70 DNL contour, for three churches and one school, for 557 single-family and 93 multi-family homes.
In the 70-75 DNL contour, for 2 churches, 2 schools, 158 single-family homes and 276 multi-family homes.



Preventive.

 These strategies apply to the DNL 65 and above noise contour.

1. Enactment of new zoning, including the establishment of a joint zoning board. 

a. 

Zoning.

 The local jurisdictions (City of Gulfport, Harrison County, and the Regional Airport Authority) should work together
to develop a plan for proper airport zoning ordinance to comply with Part 150 noise land use compatibility criteria.

b. 

Establish a Joint Airport Zoning Board.

 Recommend that Chapters of the Mississippi Code be amended to permit the Joint Airport Zoning Board to enact airport
zoning regulations for areas impacted by airport noise. In addition, the GBRAA, County of Harrison, and City of Gulfport
should establish a Joint Airport Zoning Board which would enact appropriate zoning in the areas surrounding the airport.

2. 

Easement acquisition of undeveloped land.

 These easements would be structured so that they would prohibit the establishment of any incompatible land use within
the noise exposure area in the future. Because the FAA does not participate in acquisition of undeveloped land, in
fee or easement, regardless of the noise level affecting the area, it is recommended that the land uses be classified
in accordance with the noise levels.

3. 

Real estate disclosure.

 Enactment of a voluntary real estate disclosure policy notifying area residents of the potential for aircraft noise
impacts within the noise exposure area. It is recommended that local developers and lending institutions inform
potential buyers.

4. 

Revised building codes.

 Each jurisdiction should revise the building codes to require noise insulating materials be used in the construction
of structures within the noise exposure area. These standards include new construction and would be imposed on existing
homes being sound attenuated within the DNL 65 contour and above.

5. 

Comprehensive planning.

 Incorporation of the study findings into the local jurisdiction comprehensive plans.

<PARENT> FR940516-2-00084 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

6. 

Enactment of an environmental review process.

 Establish an environmental review process to ensure that proposed development within the airport noise exposure
area is compatible or that appropriate measures are undertaken to achieve compatibility.



Implementation Measures



1. 

Letter to Airmen.

 A Letter to Airmen would be an appropriate mechanism for the FAA to use in communicating ATC-related noise abatement
measures to pilots.

2. 

Noise Abatement Bulletin.

 A Noise Abatement Bulletin would be an appropriate mechanism to communicate the noise abatement program to pilots.

3. 

Distribution of Materials.

 The airport should provide copies of the Letter to Airmen and the Noise Abatement Bulletin to the military and airlines
for distribution to pilots and to FBO's.

4. 

Provision for Revision of Noise Exposure Maps and Noise Compatibility Program.

 The NCP calls for revision to the NCP and to the NEM's.

5. 

Continuation of the NCP Advisory Committee as a Noise Abatement Committee.

 It is recommended that the airport continue the advisory committees as a noise abatement committee.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on April 1, 1994.

B. The FAA also has completed its review of the revised noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Gulfport-Biloxi
Regional Airport Authority. The specific maps under consideration are Figure 5-1, ``Short-Term (1992) Noise
Abatement Contours with Existing Off-Airport Land Use,'' and Figure 5-2, ``Long-Term, (1997) Noise Abatement
Contours (1500' Runway Extension and North Flow Preferential Runway Use), with Existing Off-Airport Land Use.''
in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for Gulfport-Biloxi Regional Airport are in compliance
with applicable requirements. This determination was effective on April 1, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport
operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures
contained in Appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data,
information, or plans.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the maps depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator that submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

Copies of the noise exposure maps, and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and copies of the Record of Approval and other
evaluation materials and documents which comprised the submittal to the FAA are available for examination at the
following locations:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
project in Benton, Hickory, and Dallas Counties in Missouri.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to build a four lane relocation of U.S. Route 65 in Benton, Hickory, and Dallas
Counties in Missouri. The improved highway would have a positive economic and social impact on the Lake of the Ozarks
region by providing traffic relief, increased mobility, and enhanced social economic opportunities.



1. The proposed highway project begins in Benton County near the Route MM Junction at Warsaw, and proceeds southward
through Hickory and Dallas Counties. It ends 1.0 miles north of Route EE near Buffalo, Missouri. The total project
distance is 47.9 miles. The proposal will provide partial relocation of U.S. Route 65 through the Lake of the Ozarks
and Pomme de Terre Lake region. The proposed project will involve grading, paving, and bridges for a four-lane relocation
with freeway right of way for the entire length of the project. Interchanges will be provided at or near major arterial
crossroads.


2. Alternatives currently under consideration include ``build'' alternatives, the ``no build'' alternative,
mass transportation alternatives, and upgrading of existing facilities.


3. To date, preliminary information has been furnished to local officials, legislators, and other interested parties.
Presentation of the concept has been made at the local level and input received. The scoping process has been initiated
with Federal, State, and local agencies. Further public hearings also will be held. To ensure that the full range of
issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions
are invited from all interested parties. Comments and questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should
be directed to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the addresses provided above.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of Open Membership Application Period for the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In 1991 the IRS established the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC). The primary purpose of
IRPAC is to provide an organized public forum for discussion of relevant information reporting issues between the
officials of the IRS and representatives of the payer community. IRPAC offers constructive observations about current
or proposed policies, programs, and procedures, and when necessary, suggests ways to improve the operation of the
Information Reporting Program. IRPAC is currently comprised of 18 representatives from various segments of the
private sector payer community. Four of these appointments to IRPAC will expire at the end of 1994. Additional members
will be selected for two-year terms beginning in January 1995.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 IRPAC reports to the Executive Director, Information Reporting Program (IRP), who is the executive responsible
for information reporting and is charged with its system-wide planning and improvement. IRPAC is instrumental in
providing advice to enhance the IRP Program. Increasing participation by external stakeholders in the planning
and improvement of the tax system will help achieve the goals of increasing voluntary compliance and reduction of
burden. IRPAC members are not paid for their time or services, but consistent with Federal regulations, they will
be reimbursed for their travel and lodging expenses to attend a two-day meeting twice each year. 






The IRS is interested in representation from different areas of the payer community (e.g., real estate, property
& casualty insurance, small business, corporate compliance, software development, employee plans, and state
& local government, etc.). Anyone wishing to be considered for membership on IRPAC should so advise the IRS. Please
complete the following questionnaire and forward it to Ms. Kate LaBuda of the IRP Planning Staff, at 
the address below.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a proposed funding priority for fiscal years 
1994-1995 for the Knowledge Dissemination and 
Utilization Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary proposes a funding priority for the 
Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization (D&U) Program under the 
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research 
(NIDRR) for fiscal years 1994-1995. The Secretary takes this 
action to ensure that rehabilitation knowledge generated from 
projects and centers funded by NIDRR and others is utilized fully 
to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities and their 
families.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice proposes a project to 
support the international exchange of information and experts. 


Authority for the D&U program is contained in sections 
202(b)(2) and 204(a) and 204(b)(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 760-762). Under this program the 
Secretary makes awards to public and private organizations, 
including institutions of higher education and Indian tribes or 
tribal organizations. Under the regulations for this program 
(see 34 CFR 355.32), the Secretary may establish a priority by 
reserving funds to support particular activities. 
This proposed priority supports the National Education 
Goals. National Education Goal 5 calls for all Americans to 
possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global 
economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of 
citizenship. 
The Secretary will announce the final funding priority in a 
notice in the 

Federal Register

. The final priority will be 
determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and 
other considerations of the Department. Funding of particular 
projects depends on the final priority, the availability of 
funds, and the quality of the applications received. The 
publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the 
Secretary from proposing an additional priority, nor does it 
limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to 
meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.





Note:

 This notice of a proposed priority does 

not 

solicit 
applications. A notice inviting applications under this 
competition will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent 
with or following publication of the notice of a final priority.

Priority


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an 
absolute preference to applications that meet the following 
priority. The Secretary proposes to fund under this program only 
applications that meet this absolute priority: 


Proposed Priority: International Exchange of Information and 
Experts 


Background 


Since 1973, NIDRR has had statutory authority to conduct 
international research and development and to exchange 
rehabilitation and special education experts with other nations. 
International research and development activities significantly 
can change the perspectives of service providers and researchers, 
provide data for the evaluation of domestic programs, and offer 
new insights and new practices that can solve some of the old 
rehabilitation problems. Learning about the technical and 
cultural aspects of other countries' rehabilitation practices may 
assist U.S. rehabilitation practioners to improve the 
effectiveness of the the services they provide, especially for 
minority and immigrant populations. 
In the past, NIDRR approached international activities in 
two ways. NIDRR funded two projects to facilitate fellowships of 
non-governmental experts to other countries to gather data on 
practices, legislation, and policy. NIDRR also engaged in 
international activities on a government-to-government basis, 
participating in international policy and data generation through 
international organizations such as the U.N., Federal agencies 
such as the Department of State and the Peace Corps, direct 
grants to foreign research agencies, participation in foreign 
research consortia and conferences, and facilitation of site 
visits and study tours for foreign visitors. 
In order to enhance the impact of international activities 
on the rehabilitation field, NIDRR now seeks to fund a single 
project that will facilitate the exchange of both domestic and 
foreign experts in rehabilitation research and technical 
assistance; facilitate international conferences; disseminate 
useful information to rehabilitation personnel and researchers, 
independent living centers, and families; assist in relevant site 
visitations by foreign government officials; and develop training 
modules that increase participation in international activities 
by rehabilitation practitioners, policymakers, and individuals 
with disabilities. 


Proposed Priority 


A project on the international exchange of information and 
experts shall_
 Gather information on international rehabilitation 
issues, legislation, and programs, and maintain a library of such 
information for use by NIDRR and other researchers; 
 Facilitate small annual conferences to explore 
international issues or to share rehabilitation information and 
data with other governments; 
 Assist both foreign and domestic professionals or 
consumers to plan trips of particular policy and programmatic 
value through the development and listing of potential sites; 
 Establish an international exchange of research and 
technical assistance experts between foreign nations and the 
U.S.; 
 Share information with other Federal government agencies 
in order to assist them in the development of their research 
priorities in the area of disability; 
 Publish and disseminate data and information to relevant 
target audiencies on relevant policy issues and legislation, 
which are identified in conjunction with NIDRR; 
 Develop training activities and materials to sensitize 
rehabilitation personnel, including special education personnel, 
to cultural differences that can affect rehabilitation needs and 
approaches; and 
 Develop training activities and materials on comparative 
research techniques, bilateral consultation and technical 
assistance, utilizing the different international perspectives. 


Invitation to Comment


Interested persons are invited to submit comments and 
recommendations regarding this proposed priority. 
All comments submitted in response to this proposed priority 
will be available for public inspection, during and after the 
comment period, in room 3423, Switzer Building, 330 C Street 
SW., Washington, DC between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 
p.m., Monday through Friday of each week except Federal holidays.

agencies administering fair housing laws and to cooperate with, and render technical assistance to, public or private
entities carrying out programs to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing practices. 

Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. 3616 note, established the Fair Housing
Initiatives Program (FHIP) to strengthen the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing Act and to further fair
housing. This program assists projects and activities designed to enforce and enhance compliance with the Fair Housing
Act and substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. Implementing regulations are found at 24 CFR
part 125. 

Three general categories of activities were established at 24 CFR part 125 for FHIP funding under section 561 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: The Administrative Enforcement Initiative, the Education and Outreach
Initiative, and the Private Enforcement Initiative. Section 905 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), amended section 561 by adding specific eligible
applicants and activities to the Education and Outreach and Private Enforcement Initiatives, as well as an entirely
new Fair Housing Organizations Initiative.

More significantly, section 905 has established FHIP as a permanent program. As originally promulgated by section
561, FHIP was a demonstration program authorized to expire on September 30, 1992. Since this demonstration period
has passed, and FHIP is now a permanent program, the Department has determined that the requirements specifically
tied to the demonstration period, namely, the testing guidelines at  125.405, are no longer applicable to FHIP.
Accordingly, the use of these testing guidelines is not required under this NOFA. The Department has executed a waiver
of  125.405 for the purposes of this NOFA, pending the elimination of this provision in the revision of 24 CFR
part 125. Because section 905 does not eliminate any FHIP provisions other than those related to its status as a demonstration
program, the Initiatives and activities currently eligible under 24 CFR part 125 remain eligible under this NOFA.


This NOFA further incorporates the HCDA 1992 section 905 FHIP additions to the extent of including the new eligible
applicants and activities, and the new Fair Housing Organizations Initiative. For the purpose of future funding
rounds, the Department is soliciting in a separate proposed rule comments on the amendment of 24 CFR part 125 by section
905. The proposed rule will be published shortly in the 

Federal Register

. However, applications for FY 1994 funds will be subject to the requirements and deadlines in this NOFA. Eligible
applicants should not wait for the rule's publication to prepare and submit their FY 1994 applications in response
to this NOFA. 

Two of the new eligible applicants, fair housing enforcement organizations and qualified fair housing enforcement
organizations, are given specific definitions, which apply to this NOFA, in section 905: 



Fair housing enforcement organization 

means any organization that_ 

(1) Is organized as a private, tax-exempt, nonprofit, charitable organization; 

(2) Is currently engaged in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations and
enforcement of meritorious claims; and 

(3) Upon the receipt of FHIP funds will continue to be engaged in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing
for fair housing violations and enforcement of meritorious claims. 



Qualified fair housing enforcement organization 

means any organization, whether or not it is solely engaged in fair housing enforcement activities, that_ 

(1) Is organized as a private, tax-exempt, nonprofit, charitable organization; 

(2) Has at least 2 years experience in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations
and enforcement of meritorious claims; and 

(3) Is engaged in complaint intake, complaint investigation, testing for fair housing violations and enforcement
of meritorious claims at the time of application for FHIP assistance.

(d) Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors 


(1) Selection Criteria for Ranking Applications for Assistance


In addition to the preference points indicated in section I.(c) for particular activities, all projects proposed
in applications will be ranked on the basis of the following criteria for selection: 
(i) 

The anticipated impact of the project proposed on the concerns identified in the application. 

(25 points) In determining the anticipated impact of the proposed project, HUD will consider the degree to which a
proposed project addresses problems and issues that are significant fair housing problems and issues, as explained
in the application, or based upon other information available to HUD. (The clarity and thoroughness of the project
description can be considered in this determination.) This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's
submissions in response to paragraph III. (a)(1) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission
Requirements.'' 
(ii) 

The extent to which the project will provide benefits in support of fair housing after funded activities have been
completed. 

(25 points) In determining the extent to which the project will provide benefits after funded activities have been
completed, HUD will consider the degree to which the project will be of continuing use in dealing with housing discrimination
after funded activities have been completed. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions
in response to paragraph III.(a)(6) and III.(a)(7) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission
Requirements.''

<TEXT>
 

(iii) 

The extent to which the project will provide the maximum impact on the concerns identified in a cost-effective manner.


(20 points) In determining the extent to which the project will provide the maximum impact on the concerns identified
in a cost effective manner, HUD will consider the quality and reasonableness of the proposed activities, timeline
and budget for implementation and completion of the project. HUD will consider as well the adequacy and clarity of
proposed procedures to be used by the agency for monitoring the progress of the project and ensuring its timely completion.
These procedures may consist of a system for checking whether or not the milestones established by the project's timeline
are being met. The applicant's capability in handling financial resources (e.g., adequate financial control procedures,
accounting procedures) will be taken into account as part of the assessment. This may be evidenced by the applicant's
financial management of previous FHIP or other civil rights project management, a certification from cognizant
auditor, and other documentation. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response
to paragraphs III.(a)(2), and III.(a)(5) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.''

(iv) 

The extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience will further the achievement of
project goals. 

(20 points) In determining the extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience will
further the achievement of the project's goals, HUD will consider the applicant's experience in formulating and
carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory practices, including the applicant's management
of past and current FHIP or other civil rights projects, the experience and qualifications of existing personnel
identified for key positions, or a description of the qualifications of new staff that will be hired, including subcontractors/consultants.
For organizations submitting an application under the Education and Outreach Initiative, HUD will consider both
fair housing experience and experience in implementing education, outreach or public information programs. This
criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III.(a)(3) of this NOFA
under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.'' 
(v) 

The extent to which the project utilizes other public or private resources that may be available. 

(10 points). Both monetary and in-kind resources identified in the application are eligible for determining the
extent to which other public or private resources are available. The resources that will be considered must be targeted
specifically for the proposed project, and must be over and above the resources available to the applicant as a part
of its usual, non-project operations for such expenses as salaries, equipment, supplies, and rent. This criterion
will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to paragraph III.(a)(4) of this NOFA under the
heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements.'' 


(2) Selection Process


Each application for funding will be evaluated competitively, and awarded points based on the Selection Criteria
for Ranking Applications for Assistance identified in section I.(d)(1) of this NOFA. The final decision rests with
the Assistant Secretary or designee. After eligible applications are evaluated against the factors for award and
assigned a score, they will be organized by rank order. The rank ordering will be done separately for: Each Initiative;
each program component (national, National Fair Housing Month, regional/local, and community-based) of the Education
and Outreach Initiative; each purpose (continued development of existing organizations, and establishing new
organizations) under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative, or funding cycle (one-year and two-year projects)
under the Private Enforcement Initiative. Awards for each Initiative will be funded in rank order until all available
funds have been obligated, or until there are no acceptable applications. 


(3) Cost Factors


The Department expects to fund multiple applications as a result of this NOFA. At some point, however, two or more complete
and eligible applications, after evaluation against the Selection Criteria, may be considered equal in technical
merit. At that point, the project's cost will become the deciding factor. Furthermore, an applicant's proposal will
not be funded when costs are determined to be unrealistically low or unreasonably high. 


(e) Applicant Notification and Award Procedures 


(1) Notification


No information will be available to applicants during the period of HUD evaluation, except for notification in writing
to those applicants that are determined to be ineligible or that have technical deficiencies in their applications
that may be corrected. Selectees will be announced by HUD upon completion of the evaluation process, subject to final
negotiations and award.

(2) Negotiations




After HUD has ranked the applications and made an initial determination of applicants whose scores are within the
funding range (but before the actual award), HUD may require that applicants in this group participate in negotiations
to determine the specific terms of the cooperative or grant agreement. In cases where it is not possible to conclude
the necessary negotiations successfully, awards will not be made.


If an award is not made to an applicant whose application is in the initial funding threshold because of an inability
to complete successful negotiations, and if funds are available to fund any applications that may have fallen outside
the initial funding threshold, HUD will select the next highest ranking applicant and proceed as described in the
preceding paragraph.



(3) Funding Instrument




HUD expects to award a cost reimbursable or fixed-price cooperative or grant agreement to each successful applicant.
HUD reserves the right, however, to use the form of assistance agreement determined to be most appropriate after negotiation
with the applicant.



(4) Reduction of Requested Grant Amounts and Special Conditions




HUD may approve an application for an amount lower than the amount requested, fund only portions of an application,
withhold funds after approval, and/or require the grantee to comply with special conditions added to the grant agreement,
in accordance with 24 CFR 85.12, the requirements of this NOFA, or where:


(i) HUD determines the amount requested for one or more eligible activities is unreasonable or unnecessary;


(ii) the application does not otherwise meet applicable cost limitations established for the program;


(iii) The applicant has requested an ineligible activity;


(iv) Insufficient amounts remain in that funding round to fund the full amount requested in the application and HUD
determines that partial funding is a viable option;

(v) The applicant has demonstrated an inability to manage HUD grants, particularly Fair Housing Initiatives Program
grants; or


(vi) For any other reason where good cause exists.



(5) Performance Sanctions




A recipient failing to comply with the procedures set forth in its grant agreement will be liable for such sanctions
as may be authorized by law, including repayment of improperly used funds, termination of further participation
in the FHIP, reduction or limitation of further funding for administrative enforcement activities, and denial of
further participation in programs of the Department or of any Federal agency.



II. Application Process




An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the Management
Work Plan and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. An application may be obtained by writing the Fair Housing
Information Clearinghouse, Post Office Box 6091, Rockville, MD 20850, or by calling the toll free number 1-800-343-3442.
To ensure a prompt response, it is suggested that requests for application kits be made by telephone.


Completed applications are to be submitted to Aztec Jacobs, Funded Programs Division, Office of Fair Housing and
Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 5234, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20410.


The application due date will be specified in the application kit. However, applicants will be given at least 60 days
from today's date, until July 15, 1994, to submit their applications. Applications will be accepted if they are received
on or before the application due date, or are received within 7 days after the application due date, but with a U.S. postmark
or receipt from a private commercial delivery service (such as, Federal Express or DHL) that is dated on or before the
application due date.


The application deadline is firm as to date. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department
will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should
take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility
brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. A transmission by facsimile machine
(``FAX'') will not constitute delivery.


An applicant may apply for funding for more than one project or activity, but a separate application must be submitted
for each of the following categories of funding:


(1) Administrative Enforcement Initiative activities;


(2) National programs under the Education and Outreach Initiative;


(3) National Fair Housing Month activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative;

(4) Regional or local activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative;

(5) Community-based activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative;

(6) One-year projects under the Private Enforcement Initiative;

(7) Two-year projects under the Private Enforcement Initiative;

(8) Continued Development of Existing Organizations activities under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative;
and

(9) Establishing New Organizations activities under the Fair Housing Organizations Initiative.

<PARENT> FR940516-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Although a separate application is required for each funding category, an application may propose more than one type
of eligible activity under each category. For example, both production and distribution of a public service message
may be proposed in a single application for a national program under the Education and Outreach Initiative. 
Applicants must submit all information required in the application kit and must include sufficient information
to establish that the application meets the selection criteria set forth in section I.(d), above, of this NOFA. 


III. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements

law that has been certified by the Department under 24 CFR part 115 as being a substantially equivalent fair housing
law must provide, with its application, documentation that it has consulted with the agency or agencies to coordinate
activities to be funded under the Education and Outreach Initiative. This coordination will ensure that the activities

Applicants will not be disqualified from being considered for funding because of technical deficiencies in their
application submission, e.g., an omission of information such as regulatory/program certifications, or incomplete
signatory requirements for application submission. 

HUD will notify an applicant in writing of any technical deficiencies in the application. The applicant must submit
corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency.

1. Are not necessary for HUD review under selection criteria/ranking factors; and 

2. Would not improve the substantive quality of the proposal. 



V. Other Matters 



Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 



The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the Federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and sub-recipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.




Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's
regulations at 24 CFR part 50 which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42
U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



Executive Order 12606, The Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the
policies announced in this Notice would not have a significant impact on the formation, maintenance, and general
well-being of families except indirectly to the extent of the social and other benefits expected from this program
of assistance. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,
Federalism, that the policies contained in this Notice will not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject
to review under the Order. The promotion of fair housing policies is a recognized goal of general benefit without direct
implications on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and
responsibilities among various levels of government.

Drug-Free Workplace Certification 


The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of Federal agencies to certify that they will provide drug-free
workplaces. Thus, each applicant must certify that it will comply with drug-free workplace requirements in accordance
with 24 CFR part 24, subpart F. 


Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 


HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. On January 14, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942 additional information that gave the public (including
applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The
documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded
under this NOFA as follows: 


Documentation and Public Access Requirements 



HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements.)



Disclosures 



HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 


Section 103 HUD Reform Act 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making
of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized
employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage.
Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted
under 24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 


Section 112 HUD Reform Act 



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to
influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those
who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking
of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment
of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units
received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.

Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912) as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in appendix A of the rule. 





Authority:

 Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 3616 note); Title VIII, Civil Rights Act
of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619); Sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Indian Child Welfare Act makes grant funds available to off-reservation Indian organizations from the Bureau
of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior, for the purpose of establishing and operating off-reservation
Indian child and family service programs.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Title II of the Indian Child Welfare Act, Public Law 95-608, authorizes the utilization of funds for grants to
Off-reservation Indian organizations. The BIA published in the January 13, 1994, 

Federal Register

, Vol. 59. No. 9, regulations revising 25 CFR Part 23, the rules that govern the Title II, ICWA grant program. Pursuant
to 25 CFR Part 23, the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs hereby announces procedures necessary for eligible off-reservation
Indian organizations to apply for the FY 1994 Title II ICWA grant funds which shall be awarded competitively under
the revised 25 CFR Part 23. The revised rules became effective on February 14, 1994. Copies of the revised 25 CFR Part
23 ICWA grant regulations may be obtained from the Area Social Workers listed in Part IV of this notice. 


A two-year developmental plan for an ICWA grant program will be accepted under this notice. Applications received
under this notice must comply with all applicable requirements and criteria specified in the revised 25 CFR Part 23.
It is important that applicants carefully review all requirements detailed in this notice relative to application
contents, deadlines, and other special instructions. If an application is not received by the close of business on
June 30, 1994, it will not be considered. 
It is incumbent upon the respective Area Director to provide the necessary technical assistance requested in accordance
with 25 CFR Part 23.42. The timeframe for receipt of requests from the off-reservation applicants for technical assistance
is 10 days prior to the close of the application deadline. 
A national total of $1,735,000 in FY 1994 ICWA funds will be awarded competitively to off-reservation Indian organizations
nationwide for grants under Title II of the Indian Child Welfare Act. 


Part I. General Information 


A. Background 


It is the policy of the BIA to emphasize and facilitate the comprehensive design, development and implementation
of Indian child and family service programs in coordination with other Federal, state, and local programs which strengthen
and preserve Indian families and Indian tribes. Thus, applicants are encouraged to design their ICWA programs/activities
that integrate with or complement existing child and family service programs or those administered by the applicant.

Section 202 of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-608, 25 U.S.C. 1932) authorizes the Secretary
to make grants to off-reservation Indian organizations to establish and operate off-reservation Indian child and
family service programs for the purpose of stabilizing and preventing the breakup of Indian families and, in particular,
to ensure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or custodian shall
be an action of last resort. These programs are intended to promote the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. 1902;
25 U.S.C. 1932). 
This notice provides information on the FY 1994 ICWA grant application process for eligible off-reservation Indian
organizations to compete for FY 1994 ICWA grant funds.

The Board of directors of any nonprofit off-reservation Indian organization may apply for a grant under this announcement.
A new application for projects of two years duration may be submitted in response to this announcement. An applicant
may not submit more than one application nor be a beneficiary of more than one grant under this or other prior notices.



C. Purpose of Off-Reservation Grants 


The purpose of every Indian child and family services program shall be to prevent the breakup of Indian families, and
ensure that the permanent removal of an Indian child from the custody of his/her Indian parent or custodian shall be
a last resort. Off-reservation Child and family service programs may include, but are not limited to: 
(a) A system for regulating, maintaining, and supporting Indian foster and adoptive homes, including a subsidy program
under which Indian adoptive children may be provided support comparable to that for which they would be eligible as
Indian foster children, taking into account the appropriate state standards of support maintenance and medical
needs; 
(b) The operation and maintenance of facilities and services for the counseling and treatment of Indian families
and Indian foster and adoptive children with the goal of strengthening and stabilizing Indian families; 
(c) Family assistance (including homemaker services and home counselors), protective day care and after school
care, employment support services, recreational activities, and respite care with the goal of strengthening Indian
families and contributing toward family stability; and 
(d) Guidance, legal representation and advice to Indian families involved in state child custody proceedings. 


Part II 


A. Available Funds 


In FY 1994, off-reservation Indian organizations will compete for a national allocation of $1,735,000. Grants will
be awarded competitively to approved off-reservation Indian organizations on the basis of service area population
within the following categories: 
(a) A maximum of up to $27,500 for eligible applicants with a total service area population of 500 or less; 
(b) A maximum of up to $35,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 500 but less
than 1,500; 
(c) A maximum of up to $45,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 1,500 but less
than 3,000; 
(d) A maximum of up to $55,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 3,000 but less
than 5,000; 
(e) A maximum of up to $65,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 5,000 but less
than 8,000; 
(f) A maximum of up to $80,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 8,000 but less
than 20,000; 
(g) A maximum of up to $110,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 20,000 but
less than 40,000; 
(h) A maximum of up to $140,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 40,000 but
less than 60,000; 
(i) A maximum of up to $175,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 60,000 but
less than 90,000; 
(j) A maximum of up to $250,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 90,000 but
less than 140,000; 
(k) A maximum of up to $350,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population greater than 140,000 but
less than 180,000; and 
(l) A maximum of up to $500,000 for eligible applicants with a total service area population over 180,000. 
Under no circumstances may any off-reservation Indian organization receive Indian Child Welfare Act grant funds
greater than the maximum grant amount of $500,000 either through a direct grant or through subgranting procedures
with approved applicants. 
No ICWA grant funds will be withheld at the Central Office for appeals related to off-reservation funding levels;
therefore, approved applications will be funded strictly on the basis of funds available to each area office and in
accordance with the funding amounts published in this grant notice. The respective Area Director has final funding
authority. 


B. Service Eligibility 


The service area population is the total number of Indians eligible for services under 25 CFR 23.50(b) in the geographical
area to which an off-reservation Indian organization can realistically provide the services proposed in the application.
The service area population is used only to determine the maximum grant amount for which an applicant may be eligible.

For purposes of eligibility for services provided under 25 U.S.C. 1932 and 1933 of the Act, any person meeting the definition
of Indian, Indian child, Indian custodian, or Indian parent of any unmarried person under the age of 18 as defined in
25 CFR Section 23.2, or the definition of Indian as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(c), shall be eligible for ICWA services.

These service area population figures must be based upon substantiated, identifiable statistical sources. Applicants
must submit copies of recent statistical data from sources which support their service area figures, such as off-reservation
population information, U.S. Census data, or off-reservation service area population data maintained by the Indian
Health Service for urban Indian populations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction


The Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, as amended, at 16 U.S.C. 753 (a), authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary),
for the purpose of developing adequate, coordinated, cooperative research and training programs for fish and wildlife
resources, to continue to enter into cooperative agreements with colleges and universities, with game and fish departments
of the several states, and with non-profit organizations relating to cooperative research units. The Departments
of Commerce (DOC), Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994 makes funds available
to the Secretary.
The research to be funded is in support of the Oyster Disease Research Program, which provides information on American
oyster disease-related research and management concerns in the northeastern United States. The program investigates
selected aspects of the life cycle of oyster pathogens, physiological and genetic factors that influence disease
resistance in the American oyster, 

Crassostrea virginica,

 and management strategies that would enhance survival of the public fishery and prospects for resource rehabilitation.
Oyster disease research is essential, given the recent devastating effect of oyster diseases on the Maryland and
Virginia oyster fisheries. Oyster harvests from the Chesapeake Bay reached record lows in 1992-1993. Fishery
management approaches that manage around the diseases have not been able to guard against widespread disease outbreaks.
New research into the diseases should provide new knowledge and new tools for managing and restoring these oyster
populations.


II. Areas of Special Emphasis 


A. Proposals should exhibit familiarity with related work that is completed or ongoing. Where appropriate, proposals
should be multidisciplinary. Coordinated efforts involving multiple eligible applicants or persons are encouraged.
Eligible women and minority scientists, associated with eligible applicants, are encouraged to submit applications.
While the areas for special emphasis are listed below, proposals in other areas will be considered on a funds-available
basis. Primary consideration for funding will be given to applications addressing the specific priorities listed
in this section. These priorities are not listed in any implied order. NMFS will accept proposals that address other
significant areas of research on 

C. virginica;

 however, consideration cannot be guaranteed.
Consideration will be given to applications that address the following American oyster disease research and management
priorities for the northeastern United States:


1. Technical Priorities


a. Investigate the basic mechanisms (physiological, genetic, immunological, biochemical, etc.) that may make


C. virginica

 resistant/susceptible to the diseases currently affecting the Northeast Region's oyster populations. This includes
the genetic basis for disease resistance and the possible development of gene transfer techniques that could lead
to improved native oysters.
b. Investigate selected aspects of the life cycle and natural history of 

C. virginicus

 pathogens, with emphasis on transmission dynamics; identification of intermediate hosts; and determination of
the time/age when young oysters first become susceptible to 

Haplosporidium nelsoni,

 commonly known as MSX, or 

Perkinsus marinus,

 known as Dermo.
c. Utilize 

P. marinus

 cultures and isolated cells to investigate the biochemistry and physiology of this pathogen, with emphasis on osmotic
tolerance of cells 

in vitro

 and the role of virulence factors in pathogenicity.
d. Investigate juvenile oyster mortalities occurring in the Northeast Region, including the identification of
the definitive disease agent, its range, and impact on the oyster industry.

2. Management-Related Priorities 



a. Develop and test new management strategies that would enhance survival of a fishery in the continuous presence
of disease, such as the establishment of brood stock sanctuaries, genetic selection programs, aquaculture techniques,
and oyster reef research and development. 

b. Develop resource survey techniques that can be adopted to manage disease-affected oyster populations effectively
and provide background data to support development of management options for resource rehabilitation. 

c. Evaluate the potential of a Geographic Information System approach for characterizing the transmission dynamics
of oyster diseases throughout the Chesapeake Bay. 

B. Applications addressing the priorities should build upon, or take into account, any related past or current work.
During FY 92 and FY 93, funds under this program were awarded for the following projects, at a total cost of $1.3 million,
for each year. 

1. FY 93:

III. How To Apply 



A. Eligible Applicants 



The cooperative agreement has been determined as the appropriate funding instrument because of the substantial
involvement of NMFS in (1) developing program research priorities, (2) performing cooperative research jointly
with eligible applicants through the NMFS unit at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory, (3) evaluating the performance
of the program for effectiveness in meeting national and regional goals for Chesapeake Bay oyster conservation and
restoration, (4) monitoring the progress of each funded project, (5) holding periodic workshops with investigators
to encourage inter-disciplinary dialogue and forge synthesis of results, and (6) working with recipients in preparation
of annual reports summarizing current accomplishments of the Oyster Disease Research Program. 

Applications for cooperative agreements under the oyster disease research program may be submitted, in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this notice, by any state game and fish department, college or university, or other
nonprofit organizations relating to cooperative research units. Eligible applicants outside the northeastern
United States (Maine to Virginia) may submit proposals, as long as their objectives support the technical and management
priorities of the Northeast Region, as defined in sections II.A.1. and II.A.2. above. All solicited proposals received
by the closing date will be considered by NMFS. Applicants will be expected to identify the principal investigators
who will be conducting the research. Curricula vitae should also be provided for all essential personnel. 

Investigators submitting proposals in response to this announcement are strongly encouraged to develop interinstitutional,
inter-disciplinary research teams in the form of single, integrated proposals or as individual proposals that are
clearly linked together. Such collaborative efforts will be factored into the final funding decision. These efforts
may be among external eligible applicants, as well as with NMFS scientists at the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory.
NMFS personnel may participate in joint efforts with non-NMFS persons or groups in these projects, as long as these
non-NMFS persons or groups have applied and successfully competed for oyster disease research funds through the
process outlined in this announcement and as long as these applications refer to, or include, an internal NMFS proposal
that details how NMFS personnel plan to cooperate. Any activities to be undertaken by NMFS personnel under such cooperative
agreements will be funded by direct transfer of oyster disease research funds or regular appropriated funds within
NMFS. No such NMFS activity is to be funded by non-NMFS persons or groups using oyster disease research funds other
than those who have successfully competed for funds under this announcement. 



B. Amount and Duration of Funds 



Under this solicitation, NMFS will fund American oyster disease research projects under this program for 1-year
cooperative agreements. Project dates should be scheduled to begin on December 1, 1994. Cooperative agreements
are approved on an annual basis but may be considered eligible for continuation beyond the first project and budget
period subject to the approved scope of work, satisfactory progress, and availability of funds at the total discretion
of NMFS. However, there are no assurances for such continuation. Publication of this notice does not obligate NMFS
to award any specific cooperative agreement or to obligate any part of the entire amount of funds available. 



C. Cost-Sharing Requirements 



Applications must reflect the total budget necessary to accomplish the project, including contributions and/or
donations. Cost sharing is not required under the oyster disease research program. However, cost sharing is encouraged
to enhance the value of a project, and in case of a tie in considering proposals for funding, cost-sharing may affect
the final decision. The appropriateness of all cost-sharing will be determined on the basis of guidance provided
in applicable Federal cost principles. If an applicant chooses to share cost, and if that application is selected
for funding, the applicants will be bound by the percentage of cost sharing reflected in the grant award.

The non-Federal share may include funds received from private sources or from state or local governments or the value
of in-kind contributions. Federal funds may not be used to meet the non-Federal share of matching funds, except as
provided by Federal statute. In-kind contributions may be in the form of, but are not limited to, personal services
rendered in carrying out functions related to the project, and permission to use real or personal property owned by
others (for which consideration is not required) in carrying out the project. 
The total cost of a project begins on the effective date of a cooperative agreement between the applicant and an authorized
representative of the U.S. Government and ends on the date specified in the award. Accordingly, the time expended
and costs incurred in either the development of a project or the financial assistance application, or in any subsequent
discussions or negotiations prior to the award, are neither reimbursable nor recognizable as part of the recipient's
cost share. 


D. Format 


1. Applications for project funding must be complete. Applicants must identify the specific research priority or
priorities to which they are responding. For applications containing more than one project, each project component
must be identified individually using the format specified in this section. If an application is not in response to
a priority, it should be so stated. Applicants should not assume prior knowledge on the part of NMFS as to the relative
merits of the project described in the application. Applications are not to be bound in any manner and should be one-sided.
All incomplete applications will be returned to the applicant. Applicants must submit one signed original and two
copies of the complete application. 
2. Applications must be submitted in the following format: 
a. 

Cover Sheet: 

An applicant must use OMB Standard Form 424 (revised 4/92) as the cover sheet for each project. Applicants may obtain
copies of these forms from the NOAA Grants Management Division or the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office (see 

ADDRESSES

). 
b. 

Project Summary: 

Each proposal must contain a summary of not more than one page that provides the following: 
(1) Project title. 
(2) Project status (new). 
(3) Project duration (beginning and ending dates). 
(4) Name, address, and telephone number of applicant. 
(5) Principal Investigator(s). 
(6) Project objectives. 
(7) Summary of work to be performed. 
(8) Total Federal funds requested. 
(9) Cost-sharing to be provided from non-Federal sources, if any. Specify whether contributions are project-related
cash or in-kind. 
(10) Total project cost. 
c. 

Project Description: 

Each project must be completely and accurately described. Each project description may be up to 15 pages in length.
If an application is awarded, NMFS will make all portions of the project description available to the public for review;
therefore, NMFS cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any information submitted as part of any project, nor will
NMFS accept for consideration any project requesting confidentiality of any part of the project. 
Each project must be described as follows: 
(1) 

Identification of Problem(s): 

Describe the specific problem to be addressed and the area of emphasis to which the project responds (see section II
above). 
(2) 

Project Objectives: 

This is one of the most important parts of the Project Proposal. Use the following guidelines for stating the objective
of the project. 
(a) Keep it simple and easily understandable. 
(b) Be as specific and quantitative as possible. 
(c) Specify the ``what and when;'' avoid the ``how and why.'' 
(d) Keep it attainable within the time, money, and manpower available.

(e) Use action verbs that are accomplishment oriented. 
(3) 

Need for Government Financial Assistance: 

Demonstrate the need for assistance. Any appropriate database to substantiate or reinforce the need for the Project
should be included. Explain why other funding sources cannot fund all the proposed work. List all other sources of
funding that are or have been sought for the project. 
(4) 

Benefits or Results Expected: 

Identify and document the results or benefits to be derived from the proposed activities. 
(5) 

Project Statement of Work: 

The Statement of Work is the scientific or technical action plan of activities that are to be accomplished during each
budget period of the project. This description must include the specific methodologies, by project job activity,
proposed for accomplishing the proposal's objective(s). If the work described in this section does not contain sufficient
detail to allow for proper technical evaluation, NMFS will not consider the application for funding and will return
it to the applicant. Each Statement of Work must include the following information: 
(a) The applicant's name. 
(b) The inclusive dates of the budget period covered under the Statement of Work. 
(c) The title of the proposal. 
(d) The scientific or technical objectives and procedures that are to be accomplished during the budget period. Devise
a detailed set of objectives and procedures to answer who, what, how, when, and where. The procedures must be of sufficient
detail to enable competent workers to be able to follow them and to complete scheduled activities. 
(e) Location of the work. 
(f) A list of all project personnel and their responsibilities. 
(g) A milestone table that summarizes the procedures (from item III.D.(c)(5)(d)) that are to be attained in each month
covered by the Statement of Work.

will be made available to the fisheries and management communities. 
(11) 

Evaluation of Project: 

The applicant is required to provide an evaluation of project accomplishments at the end of each budget period and
in the final report. The application must describe the methodology or procedures to be followed to determine technical
feasibility, or to quantify the results of the project in promoting increased production, product quality and safety,
management effectiveness, or other measurable factors. 
(12) 

Total Project Costs: 

Total project costs is the amount of funds required to accomplish what is proposed in the Statement of Work, and includes
contributions and donations. All costs must be shown in a detailed budget. Cost-sharing must not come from another
Federal source. Costs must be allocated to the Federal share and non-Federal share provided by the applicant or other
sources. Non-Federal costs are to be divided into cash and in-kind contributions. A standard budget form (SF-424A)
