<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Travis, Texas, Nonappropriated Fund
(NAF) Federal Wage System wage area. The Travis NAF wage area is composed of Travis County, Texas (survey area), and
Burnet County, Texas (area of application). This regulation redefines Travis County, Texas, to the Bexer, Texas,
NAF wage area as an area of application and Burnet County, Texas, to the Bell, Texas, NAF wage area as an area of application.
Because of downsizing associated with a scheduled base closure, the Travis NAF wage area did not have the required
minimum of 26 NAF wage employees within the survey area, and no local activity within the Travis NAF wage area had the
capability to conduct a wage survey.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 30, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 45413) to abolish the Travis, Texas, NAF wage area and define
it to other NAF wage areas for pay-setting purposes. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment.
OPM received no comments during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is being adopted as a final rule. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they affect only Federal agencies and employees.

Accordingly, under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5343, the interim rule amending 5 CFR part 532 published on August 30,
1993 (58 FR 45413) is adopted as final without any changes.

<ACTION>
ACTION. 

Confirmation of regulations.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) has reviewed subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the Agricultural
Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (Act). Pursuant to this review, FGIS has determined that no change will be made to
these regulations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

An advance notice of proposed rulemaking requesting public comment on subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the
Act was published in the 

Federal Register 

on August 27, 1993, (58 FR 45295).


FGIS solicited data, views, and arguments concerning the need for revising these regulations, the potential for
improvement, and language clarity. FGIS also requested comments on several issues identified by interested parties.
The objective of this review was to ensure that the regulations continue to serve the needs of the marketplace to the
greatest extent possible. 
Within the 90-day comment period that ended on November 26, 1993, only one written comment was received. This comment,
submitted by the Rice Millers' Association (RMA), asked FGIS to postpone proposing any rulemaking action that would
``allow requests for divided-lot certificates to be made for up to 1 year from the outstanding certificate date and,
at the discretion of the Service, after the identity of the commodity has been lost'' pending further review of the
potential impact of much action. FGIS appreciates RMA's concern and will study this issue further. No changes will
be proposed at this time. 
Based on the information available, FGIS has determined that subpart A of the part 68 regulations under the Act are
meeting the needs of the industry and no changes are necessary at this time.

Rural Business Enterprise Grants and Television Demonstration Grants


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulation that is utilized by the Rural Development Administration
(RDA) to make grants to facilitate the development of small and emerging business enterprises in rural areas. A change
is needed to implement Title V, Section 516(d) of Public Law 102-552, Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety
and Soundness Act of 1992, which provides that grants may also be made to create, expand, and operate rural distance
learning networks and rural learning programs that provide educational or job training instruction related to potential
employment or job advancement for adult students. The intended effect is to make this an eligible grant purpose under
the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Classification


We are issuing this interim final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Office of Management and
Budget has determined that it is a ``significant regulatory action.''


Environmental Impact Statement


This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' RDA has
determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the 
quality of the human environment and, in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190),
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.


Executive Order 12778


This document regulation has been reviewed in light of Executive Order 12778 and meets the applicable standards provided
in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of that Order. Provisions within this part which are inconsistent with State law are controlling.
All administrative remedies pursuant to 7 CFR part 1900, subpart B, must be exhausted prior to filing suit.


Intergovernmental Review


This action affects the following RDA program as listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under 10.769
Rural Business Enterprise and Television Demonstration Grants and is subject to the provisions of E.O. 12372, which
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; 48 FR 29112,
June 24, 1983, 49 FR 2267, May 31, 1984, 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985.)


Paperwork Reduction Act


The information collection requirements contained in this regulation have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control number 0575-0132
in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This interim rule does not revise or impose
any new information collection requirement from those approved by OMB.


Discussion of the Interim Rule


It is the policy of the Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall
be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, the Department
is making this action effective 
immediately upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 without securing prior public comment. The purpose of this rule is to implement Title V, Section 516(d), of Public
Law 102-552, Farm Credit Banks and Association Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, which amends Section 310B(c)
(7 U.S.C. 1932(c)) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act which allows grants for the creation, expansion,
and operation of rural distance learning networks or rural learning programs that provide educational instruction
or job training instruction related to potential employment or job advancement for adult students. This rule making
action does not encompass discretionary decision making by the agency, but merely adds the text of Section 516(d)'s
amendment to Section 310B(c) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act into the regulations governing the
Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. That program provides grants to facilitate the development of small and
emerging private business enterprises in rural areas. This assistance is expected to further the development of
small and emerging private business enterprises in rural areas by making available to developing businesses qualified
employees necessary for successful startup or expansion. While the Department is reluctant to short circuit prior
public comment, it is certain that failure to implement the program will result in negative impact in rural areas by
not fully utilizing the grant program to its fullest authorization for avenues to help facilitate the development
of businesses in rural areas. Because the appropriated funds for the program are not available past the end of fiscal
year 1994, it is essential that this authorization be implemented this fiscal year.

The rule describing procedures and practices for applying for and obtaining this grant assistance is already in place
under the Rural Business Enterprise Grant program. This rule simply adds education and training of adult students
as an eligible grant purpose under the program. Requiring prior notice and comment would result in substantial delays
in making the use of these grant funds available to the public for education purposes. Public controversy over adding
this eligible use of grant funds is unlikely. The Agency, however, is also providing for public comment so that, in
the event that members of the public do wish to suggest alternative rule provisions or courses of action in implementing
this program, they will have an opportunity to give RDA the benefit of their views in the near future. In the event that
public comments are received, the Department will consider them, and issue such amendments to those rules as may be
appropriate, as quickly as possible.

Conditional Permanent Resident Regulations for Alien Entrepreneurs, Spouses, and Children


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule implements provisions of section 121 of the Immigration Act of 1990, by providing for removal of conditional
resident status of certain alien entrepreneurs, their spouses, and children. It sets forth the standards and procedures
for the removal of the conditional basis of permanent resident status through the filing of a petition by the alien
entrepreneur. This rule will allow alien entrepreneurs to continue their commercial enterprise while providing
jobs in the United States.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


As part of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649, November 29, 1990, Congress created the Employment
Creation immigrant visa category under section 203(b)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act). Section
203(b)(5) of the Act sets aside immigrant visas for aliens seeking to enter the United States for the purpose of engaging
in a new commercial enterprise. To qualify under this immigrant visa category, the alien must invest $1,000,000 (or
$500,000 in certain targeted areas) and create at least ten full-time jobs. On November 29, 1991, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (Service) issued a final regulation on implementing the provisions of section 203(b)(5)
of the Act.
Under section 121 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (section 216A of the Act), Congress determined that aliens admitted
to the United States under the Employment Creation category as alien entrepreneurs and their spouses and children
should be admitted as conditional permanent residents as a means to deter immigration-related entrepreneurship
fraud. Section 216A of the Act provides for a two-year conditional resident status for alien entrepreneurs and their
spouses and unmarried children. It also provides for termination of status if the Service determines that the qualifying
commercial enterprise was improper and sets forth the criteria and procedures for the alien entrepeneur to remove
conditional resident status.


Termination of Conditional Resident Status

Section 216A(b) of the Act calls for the termination of the alien's conditional permanent resident status during
the two-year period if the Service determines that establishment of the commercial enterprise was intended solely
as a means to evade United States immigration laws; that the alien did not establish the new commercial enterprise;
that the alien did not invest or was not in the process of investing the prescribed capital; that the alien was not sustaining
the new commercial enterprise or the investment of capital; or that the alien was not otherwise conforming to the requirements
of his or her status. In addition, in light of Congress' intent to prevent further processing of an alien's visa if it
becomes known that the alien obtained the money invested through other than legal means, this regulation adds an additional
ground to terminate an alien entrepreneur's conditional permanent resident status. Section 216A(b) of the Act provides
that if the Service decides to terminate the alien entrepreneur's conditional permanent resident status, the alien
shall be notified of such decision and may request a review of the Service's determination in a deportation proceeding.
In a deportation proceeding, the Service has the burden of proof to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that
one of the reasons for termination is true. Accordingly, 8 CFR 216.3 will be revised to allow for termination of conditional
permanent resident status for alien entrepreneurs.



Petition for Removal of Conditions



Section 216A(c)(1) and 216A(d)(2)(A) of the Act require that the alien entrepreneur file a petition for removal of
conditions during the 90-day period before the second anniversary of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent
resident status. The final regulation provides that the alien entrepreneur file Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur
to Remove Conditions, with the Service Center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien's commercial enterprise.
The petition should include the alien entrepreneur's spouse and children, even if the children marry or reach the
age of twenty-one during the period of conditional residence. The final rule also permits the spouse and children
of a deceased principal alien entrepreneur to file a petition and have conditions removed, if the spouse and/or children
can show that, despite the entrepreneur's death, the requirements for removal of conditions have been met. 

Under the final regulation, the Service Center will review the petition for removal of conditions. If the Service
Center director determines in his or her discretion that a decision may be made on the basis of the petition and accompanying
evidence without the necessity of an interview, the director will render a decision on the petition. If the director
determines that an interview is needed, the Service Center director will schedule the alien entrepreneur for an interview
at a local Service district office or sub-office having jurisdiction over the alien's commercial enterprise. The
district director will then render a decision on the petition. 

If the alien entrepreneur fails to file a timely petition for removal of conditions or, without good cause shown, fails
to appear for a scheduled personal interview, the alien's status will be terminated and an order to show cause will
be issued. The Service's decision may be reviewed in deportation proceedings, but, in all instances, the burden will
rest with the alien to show compliance with the filing and interview requirements. The Service may accept and consider
a late petition if the alien demonstrates good cause and extenuating circumstances for failing to file a timely petition.




Decision on Petition



Section 216A(d)(1) of the Act provides that each petition shall contain facts and information demonstrating that
a commercial enterprise was established by the alien, the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing
the requisite capital, and the alien sustained the commercial enterprise and the investment of the required capital
during the two years of conditional residence. Under 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii), the alien entrepreneur will be considered
to have ``sustained'' the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially
met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment
over the two years of conditional residence. This liberal interpretation of the term ``sustained'' permits the Service
maximum flexibility in determining whether the requirements for removal of conditional resident status have been
met, as well as following Congress' intent to ensure that ``all aliens receiving visas in this section * * *
continue their new commercial enterprises so that the creation of U.S. jobs and the infusion of capital into the U.S.
economy is sustained.'' See S. Rep. No. 101-55, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 22 (1989). The Service recognizes that
a bona-fide and good faith investment may not, by the end of the two-year period, meet all the expectations envisioned
when the alien entrepreneur obtained conditional resident status. The determination of whether the alien entrepreneur
has invested a substantial portion of the requisite capital in good faith will be made on a case-by-case basis. As discussed
in the preamble to the proposed rule, in determining whether the alien entrepreneur has demonstrated that he or she
invested the requisite capital in good faith, the Service will examine his or her intent based on both objective and
subjective standards. See 59 FR 1317-18. The alien entrepreneur has the burden of proof that he or she has, in
good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his
or her capital investment during the two-year conditional resident period.

On January 10, 1994, at 59 FR 1317-1323, the Service published a proposed rule with request for comments in the


Federal Register

. Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before February 9, 1994. The Service received three
comments relating to the proposed rule. 



Comments 



Two commenters criticized the proposed regulation for lacking any time limits for the Service to adjudicate a petition
for removal of conditions. One commenter suggested that if the Service takes no action on a petition, the petition
should be automatically granted after a set period of time. 

Section 216A(c)(3) of the Act provides that the Attorney General make a determination on a petition to remove conditions
within 90 days of the date the petition is filed or within 90 days of the interview, whichever is later. Accordingly,
8 CFR 216.6(b)(1) of the proposed regulation states that the Service Center director must either waive the interview
requirement and adjudicate the petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date the alien entrepreneur
filed the petition. This regulation is, of course, subject to the provisions of 8 CFR 103.2(b)(10)(i). 8 CFR 216.6(c)(1)
provides that a decision on a petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the date of
interview, whichever is later. The above provisions in the proposed regulation adequately address the commenters'
concerns as well as meet the adjudication time line set forth in section 216A(c)(3) of the Act. 

There is no provision in section 216A requiring the Service to approve a petition if the Service fails to adjudicate
a petition within 90 days after filing or after an interview. Section 216A(c)(3) of the Act states that the Service
must make a determination whether the facts and information described in the contents of the petition are true. Requiring
the Service to ``automatically'' approve a petition after the 90-day period has elapsed would be contrary to the language
of section 216A(c)(3) of the Act. 

Two of the commenters suggested that the Service list additional types of evidence in 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(ii) to show
that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. This regulation states
that such evidence may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement. The commenters contended that
although an audited financial statement is only a suggested document, it might set too high a standard in the mind of
a Service examiner. They suggested other types of evidence such as bank statements or certificates from certified
public accountants or officers of the investment entity. 

As clearly stated in the regulation, an audited financial statement is only a suggested type of evidence. There is
no basis for the contention that mentioning an audited financial statement in the regulation would set too high a standard.
The Service recognizes that it is not common practice for all companies to have audited financial statements. The
regulation will be amended to include ``other probative evidence'' indicating establishment of a commercial enterprise.
The Service notes that it is possible that the evidence necessary to meet the documentation requirements of 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii),
such as bank statements, would be sufficient to meet the evidence required under 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(i) and (ii). Accordingly,
8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(ii) will be amended to also include ``other probative evidence'' that a commercial enterprise
has been established. 

Two of the commenters were concerned that proposed 8 CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii) requires that the alien entrepreneur make
the full capital investment in cash within the two-year conditional residence period. They argued that the wording
of the proposed regulation should specifically cover situations where only a portion of the capital in the form of
cash has been invested, with the remainder of the capital to be invested by the commercial enterprise. The proposed
regulation refers to substantially meeting and maintaining the alien entrepreneur's capital investment. See 8
CFR 216.6(a)(4)(iii). As noted previously in this preamble, the regulation contemplates certain limited circumstances
in which the entire amount of the requisite capital has not been invested by the end of the two-year period. Further,
the word capital refers not only to a cash investment, but also to other types of investments which meet the definition
of capital found in 8 CFR 204.6(e). The proposed regulation is sufficiently flexible to permit situations in which
the requisite capital invested is in a form other than cash. For these reasons, the proposed rule, therefore, will
not be amended. 

One commenter contended that the Service should state in the regulations that a good faith commitment on a debt agreement,
which is secured by the alien entrepreneur's assets, should suffice to meet the requirement that the alien entrepreneur
has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement of the statute and continuously maintained
the investment. Under the statute, changing the wording of the regulation to include a good faith commitment is not
warranted. Section 216A(d)(1) of the Act requires that the alien entrepreneur invested or was actively in the process
of investing the requisite capital and sustained those actions during the two-year conditional residence period.
The language of section 216A(d)(1)(B) of the Act uses the past, rather than the present, tense in requesting information
showing that the alien entrepreneur invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. While
there is no statutory requirement with respect to when the requisite capital must have been invested during the two-year
period, it is clear that, by using the past tense, Congress expressed its intent that substantially all of the requisite
capital be invested by the alien entrepreneur before the expiration of conditional resident status. Accordingly,
the Service will not adopt the commenter's suggestion.

Two commenters recommended that the divorced spouse of the principal entrepreneur be entitled to have his or her conditional
resident status removed. One of those commenters also suggested that children who reach the age of 21 or marry during
the conditional residence period should be able to have their conditional resident status removed. Section 216.6(a)(1)
of the proposed regulation clearly states that children who marry or reach the age of 21 during the conditional residence
period can be included in the principal alien entrepreneur's petition to remove the conditions. The Service has carefully
considered the commenters' suggestion that divorced spouses of alien entrepreneurs should also be allowed to remove
their conditional residence status. The Service agrees with the commenters that divorced spouses of alien entrepreneurs
should be able to remove their conditional resident status as long as the divorce occurred during the conditional
residence period. Accordingly, section 216.6(a)(1) of the final regulation will allow divorced spouses of alien
entrepreneurs to remove their conditional resident status. The children and the present or former spouse of the alien
entrepreneur may be included in the entrepreneur's petition to remove the conditions or they may file a separate petition
to remove conditions. They are eligible to have their conditional resident status removed only if the Service removes
the alien entrepreneur's conditional resident status.

Two commenters urged the Service to state in the regulations that the legality of the source of the alien entrepreneur's
funds should be determined by U.S., rather than foreign standards. The commenters are concerned that aliens would
be precluded from applying lawfully acquired funds which were taken out of a country in violation of its export currency
laws and placed in a new commercial enterprise in the United States as qualifying capital. The only provision in the
proposed regulations concerning source of capital is 8 CFR 216.3(a), which states that the Service shall terminate
the alien entrepreneur's status if it becomes known to the government that the alien obtained his or her capital through
other legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). When the alien files Form I-526, Immigrant Petition
by Alien Entrepreneur, he or she must show that the capital invested was obtained through lawful means. See 8 CFR 204.6(j)(3).
The commenters' suggestion is more appropriately addressed to 8 CFR 204.6(j)(2)(ii), which addresses this issue
in more detail. The Service notes, however, that without more specific information about the particular country's
currency restriction laws, it is difficult to determine whether capital, in a given case, was obtained through other
than lawful means. Each petition must be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the Service does not feel
that it is appropriate to amend this regulation.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is intended to allow alien entrepreneurs to continue
their commercial enterprises thereby providing jobs in the United States. This rule merely sets forth the procedures
for terminating the conditional resident status of alien entrepreneurs already present in the country and for removing
the conditional basis of permanent resident status for such persons. This rule, therefore, will have, at most, an
indirect and attenuated effect on such business entities.



Executive Order 12866



This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).



Executive Order 12612



The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.



Executive Order 12606



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has addressed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.

This rule contains information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collections are
contained in 8 CFR 299.5. The OMB control number for the Form I-829 is 1115-0190.

 216.3 

Termination of conditional resident status.



(a) 

During the two-year conditional period

. The director shall send a formal written notice to the conditional permanent resident of the termination of the alien's
conditional permanent resident status if the director determines that any of the conditions set forth in section
216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable, are true, or it becomes known to the government that an
alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her investment capital
through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). If the Service issues a Notice of Intent
to Terminate an alien's conditional resident status, the director shall not adjudicate Form I-751 or Form I-829
until it has been determined that the alien's status shall not be terminated. During this time, the alien shall continue
to be a lawful conditional permanent resident with all the rights, privileges, and responsibilities provided to
persons possessing such status. Prior to issuing the Notice of Termination, the director shall provide the alien
with an opportunity to review and rebut the evidence upon which the decision is to be based, in accordance with  103.2(b)(2)
of this chapter. The termination of status, and all of the rights and privileges concomitant thereto (including authorization
to accept or continue in employment in this country), shall take effect as of the date of such determination by the director,
although the alien may request a review of such determination in deportation proceedings. In addition to the notice
of termination, the director shall issue an order to show cause why the alien should not be deported from the United
States, in accordance with part 242 of this chapter. During the ensuing deportation proceedings, the alien may submit
evidence to rebut the determination of the director. The burden of proof shall be on the Service to establish, by a preponderance
of the evidence, that one or more of the conditions in section 216(b)(1) or 216A(b)(1) of the Act, whichever is applicable,
are true, or that an alien entrepreneur who was admitted pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act obtained his or her
investment capital through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal drugs). 

(b) 

Determination of fraud after two years

. If, subsequent to the removal of the conditional basis of an alien's permanent resident status, the director determines
that an alien spouse obtained permanent resident status through a marriage which was entered into for the purpose
of evading the immigration laws or an alien entrepreneur obtained permanent resident status through a commercial
enterprise which was improper under section 216A(b)(1) of the Act, the director may institute rescission proceedings
pursuant to section 246 of the Act (if otherwise appropriate) or deportation proceedings under section 242 of the
Act. 

11. In  216.4, paragraph (a)(1) is amended by revising the phrase ``a Joint Petition to Remove the Conditional
Basis of Alien's Permanent Resident Status'' in the first sentence, to read: ``a Petition to Remove the Conditions
on Residence''. 

12. In  216.4, the heading is revised and paragraph (a)(1) is amended by adding a new sentence at the end of the
paragraph to read as follows:

14. In  216.4, paragraph (a)(6) is amended in the first sentence by removing the phrase ``or Form I-752''.

Waiver of requirement to file joint petition to remove conditions by alien spouse. 



(a) 

General

. A conditional resident alien who is unable to meet the requirements under section 216 of the Act for a joint petition
for removal of the conditional basis of his or her permanent resident status may file a Petition to Remove the Conditions

(a) 

Filing the petition

_(1) 

General procedures. 

A petition to remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status of an alien accorded conditional permanent
residence pursuant to section 203(b)(5) of the Act must be filed by the alien entrepreneur on Form I-829, Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions. The alien entrepreneur must file Form I-829 within the 90-day period
preceding the second anniversary of his or her admission to the United States as a conditional permanent resident.
Before Form I-829 may be considered as properly filed, it must be accompanied by the fee required under  103.7(b)(1)
of this chapter, and by documentation as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, and it must be properly signed
by the alien. Upon receipt of a properly filed Form I-829, the alien's conditional permanent resident status
shall be extended automatically, if necessary, until such time as the director has adjudicated the petition. The
entrepreneur's spouse and children should be included in the petition to remove conditions. Children who have reached
the age of twenty-one or who have married during the period of conditional permanent residence and the former spouse
of an entrepreneur, who was divorced from the entrepreneur during the period of conditional permanent residence,
may be included in the alien entrepreneur's petition or may file a separate petition.


(2) 

Jurisdiction. 

Form I-829 must be filed with the regional service center having jurisdiction over the location of the alien
entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.


(3) 

Physical presence at time of filing. 

A petition may be filed regardless of whether the alien is physically present in the United States. However, if the
alien is outside the United States at the time of filing, he or she must return to the United States, with his or her spouse
and children, if necessary, to comply with the interview requirements contained in the Act. Once the petition has
been properly filed, the alien may travel outside the United States and return if in possession of documentation as
set forth in  211.1(b)(1) of this chapter, provided the alien complies with the interview requirements described
in paragraph (b) of this section. An alien who is not physically present in the United States during the filing period
but subsequently applies for admission to the United States shall be processed in accordance with  235.11 of
this chapter.


(4) 

Documentation. 

The petition for removal of conditions must be accompanied by the following evidence:


(i) Evidence that a commercial enterprise was established by the alien. Such evidence may include, but is not limited
to, Federal income tax returns;


(ii) Evidence that the alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital. Such evidence
may include, but is not limited to, an audited financial statement or other probative evidence; and


(iii) Evidence that the alien sustained the actions described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) of this section
throughout the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained
the actions required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment
requirement of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional
residence. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, bank statements, invoices, receipts, contracts, business
licenses, Federal or State income tax returns, and Federal or State quarterly tax statements.


(iv) Evidence that the alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable time ten full-time jobs for qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien entrepreneur must
submit evidence that the commercial enterprise maintained the number of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment
level for the period following his or her admission as a conditional permanent resident. Such evidence may include
payroll records, relevant tax documents, and Forms I-9.


(5) 

Termination of status for failure to file petition. 

Failure to properly file Form I-829 within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary
of the date on which the alien obtained lawful permanent residence on a conditional basis shall result in the automatic
termination of the alien's permanent resident status and the initiation of deportation proceedings. The director
shall send a written notice of termination and an order to show cause to an alien entrepreneur who fails to timely file
a petition for removal of conditions. No appeal shall lie from this decision; however, the alien may request a review
of the determination during deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden of proof shall rest
with the alien to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the requirement to file the petition
within the designated period. The director may deem the petition to have been filed prior to the second anniversary
of the alien's obtaining conditional permanent resident status and accept and consider a late petition if the alien
demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that failure to file a timely petition was for good cause and due to extenuating
circumstances. If the late petition is filed prior to jurisdiction vesting with the immigration judge in deportation
proceedings and the director excuses the late filing and approves the petition, he or she shall restore the alien's
permanent resident status, remove the conditional basis of such status, and cancel any outstanding order to show
cause in accordance with  242.7 of this chapter. If the petition is not filed until after jurisdiction vests
with the immigration judge, the immigration judge may terminate the matter upon joint motion by the alien and the Service.

(6) 

Death of entrepreneur and effect on spouse and children. 

If an entrepreneur dies during the prescribed two-year period of conditional permanent residence, the spouse and
children of the entrepreneur will be eligible for removal of conditions if it can be demonstrated that the conditions
set forth in paragraph (a)(4) of this section have been met.

(b) 

Petition review

_(1) 

Authority to waive interview.

 The director of the service center shall review the Form I-829 and the supporting documents to determine whether
to waive the interview required by the Act. If satisfied that the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section have been met, the service center director may waive the interview and approve the petition. If not so satisfied,
then the service center director shall forward the petition to the district director having jurisdiction over the
location of the alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States so that an interview of the alien
entrepreneur may be conducted. The director must either waive the requirement for an interview and adjudicate the
petition or arrange for an interview within 90 days of the date on which the petition was properly filed.

(2) 

Location of interview.

 Unless waived, an interview relating to the Form I-829 shall be conducted by an immigration examiner or other
officer so designated by the district director at the district office that has jurisdiction over the location of the
alien entrepreneur's commercial enterprise in the United States.

(3) 

Termination of status for failure to appear for interview.

 If the alien fails to appear for an interview in connection with the petition when requested by the Service, the alien's
permanent resident status will be automatically terminated as of the second anniversary of the date on which the alien
obtained permanent residence. The alien will be provided with written notification of the termination and the reasons
therefore, and an order to show cause shall be issued placing the alien under deportation proceedings. The alien may
seek review of the decision to terminate his or her status in such proceedings, but the burden shall be on the alien to
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she complied with the interview requirements. If the alien
has failed to appear for a scheduled interview, he or she may submit a written request to the district director asking
that the interview be rescheduled or that the interview be waived. That request should explain his or her failure to
appear for the scheduled interview, and if a request for waiver of the interview, the reasons such waiver should be
granted. If the district director determines that there is good cause for granting the request, the interview may
be rescheduled or waived, as appropriate. If the district director waives the interview, he or she shall restore the
alien's conditional permanent resident status, cancel any outstanding order to show cause in accordance with  242.7
of this chapter, and proceed to adjudicate the alien's petition. If the district director reschedules that alien's
interview, he or she shall restore the alien's conditional permanent resident status, and cancel any outstanding
order to show cause in accordance with  242.7 of this chapter. If the interview is rescheduled at the request
of the alien, the Service shall not be required to conduct the interview within the 90-day period following the filing
of the petition.

(c) 

Adjudication of petition.

 (1) The decision on the petition shall be made within 90 days of the date of filing or within 90 days of the interview,
whichever is later. In adjudicating the petition, the director shall determine whether:

(i) A commercial enterprise was established by the alien;
(ii) The alien invested or was actively in the process of investing the requisite capital; and
(iii) The alien sustained the actions described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section throughout
the period of the alien's residence in the United States. The alien will be considered to have sustained the actions
required for removal of conditions if he or she has, in good faith, substantially met the capital investment requirement
of the statute and continuously maintained his or her capital investment over the two years of conditional residence.
(iv) The alien created or can be expected to create within a reasonable period of time ten full-time jobs to qualifying
employees. In the case of a ``troubled business'' as defined in 8 CFR 204.6(j)(4)(ii), the alien maintained the number
of existing employees at no less than the pre-investment level for the previous two years.
(2) If derogatory information is determined regarding any of these issues or it becomes known to the government that
the entrepreneur obtained his or her investment funds through other than legal means (such as through the sale of illegal
drugs), the director shall offer the alien entrepreneur the opportunity to rebut such information. If the alien entrepreneur
fails to overcome such derogatory information or evidence the investment funds were obtained through other than
legal means, the director may deny the petition, terminate the alien's permanent resident status, and issue an order
to show cause. If derogatory information not relating to any of these issues is determined during the course of the
interview, such information shall be forwarded to the investigations unit for appropriate action. If no unresolved
derogatory information is determined relating to these issues, the petition shall be approved and the conditional
basis of the alien's permanent resident status removed, regardless of any action taken or contemplated regarding
other possible grounds for deportation.
(d) 

Decision

_(1) 

Approval.

 If, after initial review or after the interview, the director approves the petition, he or she will remove the conditional
basis of the alien's permanent resident status as of the second anniversary of the alien's entry as a conditional permanent
resident. He or she shall provide written notice of the decision to the alien and shall require the alien to report to
the appropriate district office for processing for a new Alien Registration Receipt Card, Form I-551, at which
time the alien shall surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued.
(2) 

Denial.

 If, after initial review or after the interview, the director denies the petition, he or she shall provide written
notice to the alien of the decision and the reason(s) therefor, and shall issue an order to show cause why the alien should
not be deported from the United States. The alien's lawful permanent resident status and that of his or her spouse and
any children shall be terminated as of the date of the director's written decision. The alien shall also be instructed
to surrender any Alien Registration Receipt Card previously issued by the Service. No appeal shall lie from this decision;
however, the alien may seek review of the decision in deportation proceedings. In deportation proceedings, the burden
shall rest with the Service to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and information in the alien's
petition for removal of conditions are not true and that the petition was properly denied.

Admission of conditional permanent residents.


(a) 

General

_(1) 

Conditional residence based on family relationship.

 An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as the spouse or son or daughter of a United States
citizen or lawful permanent resident shall be examined to determine whether the conditions of section 216 of the Act
apply.
If so, the alien shall be admitted conditionally for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien shall
be notified that the alien and his or her petitioning spouse must file a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence
(Form I-751) within the 90-day period immediately preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission
for permanent residence.
(2) 

Conditional residence based on entrepreneurship.

 An alien seeking admission to the United States with an immigrant visa as an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section
216A(f)(1) of the Act) or the spouse or unmarried minor child of an alien entrepreneur shall be admitted conditionally
for a period of two years. At the time of admission, the alien shall be notified that the principal alien (entrepreneur)
must file a Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I-829) within the 90-day period immediately
preceding the second anniversary of the alien's admission for permanent residence.

(c) 

Expired conditional permanent resident status.

 The lawful permanent resident alien status of a conditional resident automatically terminates if the conditional
basis of such status is not removed by the Service through approval of a Petition to Remove the Conditions on Residence
(Form I-751) or, in the case of an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act), a Petition
by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions (Form I-829). Therefore, an alien who is seeking admission as a returning
resident subsequent to the second anniversary of the date on which conditional residence was obtained (except as
provided in  211.1(b)(1) of this chapter) and whose conditional basis of such residence has not been removed
pursuant to section 216(c) or 216A(c) of the Act, whichever is applicable, shall be placed under exclusion proceedings.
However, in a case where conditional residence was based on a marriage, exclusion proceedings may be terminated and
the alien may be admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form I-751) is filed jointly, or by
the alien alone (if appropriate), and approved by the Service. In the case of an alien entrepreneur, exclusion proceedings
may be terminated and the alien admitted as a returning resident if the required petition (Form I-829) is filed
by the alien entrepreneur and approved by the Service.

Ancillary matters, applications.



(a) 

Creation of the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 

The respondent may apply to the immigration judge for suspension of deportation under section 244(a) of the Act; for
adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, or under section 1 of the Act of November 2, 1966, or under section
101 or 104 of the Act of October 28, 1977; or for the creation of a record of lawful admission for permanent residence
under section 249 of the Act. The application shall be subject to the requirements of parts 244, 245, and 249 of this
chapter. The approval of any application made to the immigration judge under section 245 of the Act by an alien spouse
(as defined in section 216(g)(1) of the Act) or by an alien entrepreneur (as defined in section 216A(f)(1) of the Act),
shall result in the alien's obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident on a conditional basis in accordance
with the provisions of section 216 or 216A of the Act, whichever is applicable. However, the Petition to Remove the
Conditions on Residence required by section 216(c) of the Act or the Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions
required by section 216A(c) of the Act shall be made to the director in accordance with part 216 of the chapter. In conjunction
with any application for creation of status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence made to an immigration
judge, if the respondent is inadmissible under any provision of section 212(a) of the Act and believes that he or she
meets the eligibility requirements for a waiver of the ground of inadmissibility, he or she may apply to the immigration
judge for such waiver. The immigration judge shall inform the respondent of his or her apparent eligibility to apply
for any of the benefits enumerated in this paragraph and shall afford the respondent an opportunity to make application
therefor during the hearing. In exercising discretionary power when considering an application under this paragraph,
the immigration judge may consider and base the decision on information not contained in the record and not made available
for inspection by the respondent, provided the Commissioner has determined that such information is relevant and
is classified under Executive Order No. 12356 (47 FR 14874, April 6, 1982) as requiring protection from unauthorized
disclosure in the interest of national security. Whenever the immigration judge believes that he or she can do so while
safeguarding both the information and its source, the immigration judge should inform the respondent of the general
nature of the information in order that the respondent may have an opportunity to offer opposing evidence. A decision
based in whole or in part on such classified information shall state that the information is material to the decision.

Revision of Grounds for Deportation; Conforming Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule makes technical amendments to conform agency regulations with statutory provisions regarding general
classes of deportable aliens. These amendments are necessary due to statutory changes. They will ensure implementation
of, and regulatory compliance with, the statutory changes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



On August 13, 1991, an interim rule with request for comments was published in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 38331. This rule amended pertinent sections of 8 CFR parts 210a, 214, 241, and 242 to reflect the technical amendments
necessary for conformity with section 241 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), Ch. 477, 66 Stat. 163 (1952),
as amended by section 602 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90), Act of Nov. 29, 1990, Public Law 101-649,
104 Stat. 4978. Section 307(h) of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of
1991 (Technical Amendments), Act of Dec. 12, 1991, Public Law 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733, subsequently made minor
corrections in section 241 of the Act.

The majority of the amendments made to section 241 of the Act by section 602 of IMMACT 90 were technical in nature, relating
in large part to citation changes. Consequently, the majority of changes to 8 CFR parts 210a, 214, 241, and 242 in the
interim rule were also technical in nature. Those regulatory changes which did alter substantive rights were so identified
in the interim rule. The comment period for the interim rule ended on September 27, 1991. The Service did not receive
any comments. Moreover, the Technical Amendments did not substantively change the interim rule. The interim rule
is, therefore, adopted as final with minor technical changes.



Regulatory Citation in the Interim Rule



In the supplementary information to the interim rule, 8 CFR 214.2(a)(10) was erroneously referred to as ``(s)ection
241.2(a)(10).'' Also, 8 CFR 214.2(f)(12(i)(E), referred to in the supplementary information and amended by the
interim regulations, has since been redesignated as 8 CFR 214.2(f)(16)(i)(D). Finally, 8 CFR 242.7a was erroneously
referred to in the paragraph heading of 8 CFR 242.7a of the interim regulations as `` 241.7a.''



Changes to Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations



The regulations at 8 CFR 242.8(a), as well as at 8 CFR 242.17(d) (in both the paragraph heading and the regulatory text),
are amended by substituting ``241(a)(1)(E)(iii)'' for ``241(a)(1)(E)(ii).'' These changes are necessary because
the Technical Amendments redesignated section 241(a)(1)(E)(ii) of the Act as section 241(a)(1)(E)(iii). Although
this amendment is not directly related to the other citation changes in Part 242, 8 CFR 242.20 is amended by substituting
`` 3.39'' for `` 3.37,'' redesignated by a recent regulatory change.



Table of Citation Changes



A table of citation changes in section 241 of the Act resulting from section 602 of IMMACT 90 was included in the supplementary
information to the interim rule. The Technical Amendments have since resulted in the addition of a new section 241(a)(1)(E)(ii),
as well as redesignated of the former section 
241(a)(1)(E)(ii) as section 241(a)(1)(E)(iii). Further, section 241(a)(21), added by section 544(b)(3) of IMMACT
90, and section 241(a)(3)(C), added by the Technical Amendments, both relate to the same deportation charge. A new
table of citation changes is, therefore, included here for informational purposes. Not all current sections of law,
however, are, in all respects, identical to the corresponding former sections.

Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Attorney General, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation
and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities because the rule merely replaces the obsolete statutory citations with the current ones.



Executive Order 12866



This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).



Executive Order 12612



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.

Importation of Certain Animal Semen 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations to prohibit the importation of animal semen from any country other than the country
in which it was collected. This action is intended to prevent the introduction of exotic animal diseases into the United
States.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


The regulations in 9 CFR part 98 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation of animal germ plasm
so as to prevent the introduction of contagious diseases of livestock or poultry into the United States. Subparts
A and B of part 98 apply to certain animal embryos and subpart C applies to certain animal semen. 
 On October 25, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 55026-55027, Docket No. 93-032-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to prohibit the importation
of animal semen from any country other than the country in which it was collected. We solicited comments concerning
our proposal for a 60-day comment period ending December 27, 1993. During that period, we received three comments,
one in support and two opposed. They were from a national veterinary association, a foreign agricultural agency,
and a national association of zoological parks and aquariums. The comments opposing the proposal are discussed below.
 One commenter argues that this action would unreasonably restrict the trade of animal semen from certain European
storage banks which stockpile animal semen collected in various other countries for export to the United States and
elsewhere. The comment claims that because these banks are located in countries free of rinderpest, foot and mouth
disease (FMD), and other diseases, and because all animal semen imported into the United States from these banks would
have been collected in countries similarly free of disease, contaminated semen would only be imported into the United
States if the semen were misidentified, commingled with contaminated semen, or otherwise contaminated while at
the storage bank. Consequently, as an alternative to our proposal, the commenter suggests that we require veterinary
guarantees attesting to the storage conditions of animal semen at regional storage banks after its import from the
country of collection and before its export to the United States. 
 Though veterinary guarantees concerning storage of animal semen after its arrival at a regional bank would help to
prevent importation of contaminated animal semen into the United States, such guarantees still would not provide
us with the control over semen collection we believe necessary to ensure that contaminated semen is not introduced
into the United States. Under the regulations, in order to import animal semen into the United States from countries
free of rinderpest and FMD, an importer must supply the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) with information regarding
the health and origin of the donor animal and the location, date, and other details regarding the semen collection.
When animal semen is imported into the United States from countries other than the country of its collection, the nature
and quality of this required information is often deficient or incomplete, and, obtaining additional information
can be difficult. We believe that such problems expose the United States to increased risk of animal disease being
introduced inadvertently through the import of contaminated semen. 
 Similarly, the other comment in opposition claims that this action would hinder animal conservation programs which
depend on the use of regional storage banks containing animal semen of endangered species, including ruminants,
collected in various countries. As an alternative to our proposal, the commenter suggests that we provide for the
certification of foreign veterinary services with animal health standards equivalent to our own. After certification,
these foreign veterinary services could regulate the export to the United States of animal semen collected in various
countries and stored in their countries' regional banks. 
 Allowing for this sort of certification would not provide us with the control over semen collection we believe necessary
to ensure that contaminated semen is not introduced into the United States. We also believe that it would be especially
difficult to certify foreign veterinary services as having animal health standards equivalent to our own; varying
biological and epidemiological factors in different countries and regions compel some veterinary services to test
imported and exported animals for diseases and pests that other veterinary services might not.
 Furthermore, there are and will continue to be available alternative conservation methods for endangered animals
involving the importation of animal semen. For example, following the effective date of this action, animal semen
still may be imported directly into the United States from the country of collection, even from FMD countries, if collected
and transported in accordance with the regulations. 
 Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change.


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act
 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
 We anticipate that the provisions of this rule will have little or no economic effect. The prohibition against importing
animal semen from a country other than the country in which it was collected will not affect significantly the cost
of doing business for importers. This rule only requires importers to import animal semen directly from the country
in which it was collected; no countries currently allowed to export animal semen under the various regulations will
be excluded as a source of animal semen as a result of this rule.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace areas at military airports in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina,
Kentucky and Mississippi. Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace when the associated control
tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the control towers located at these
areas are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight
rule (IFR) operations when these control towers are closed.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments on the Rule


Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments and, if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the regulation or amend the regulation.
Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule, and in determining whether additional rulemaking is required. Comments are
specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects
of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.


The Rule


This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace areas at military airports
in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and Mississippi. Currently, this airspace is designated
as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is
needed for IFR operations at Homestead AFB, FL, Patrick AFB, FL, Lawson AAF, GA, Dobbins AFB, GA, Moody AFB, GA, Beaufort
MCAS, SC, Cherry Point MCAS, NC, Godman AAF, KY and Keesler AFB, MS, when the control towers are closed. The intended
effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at these airports when these control
towers are closed.
As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented,
the FAA concludes that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe
and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C.
553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace areas at numerous locations
in South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama. Currently, this airspace is designated
as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is

FL, Gainesville, FL, Orlando, Executive, FL, Melbourne, FL, St. Petersburg-Clearwater, FL, Atlanta, Fulton County

AL, when the control towers are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E Airspace for
IFR operations at these airports when these control towers are closed.

As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).

Job Training Partnership Act: Veterans' Employment Programs Under Title IV, Part C; Removal of Regulations 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

The Employment and Training Administration and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and
Training, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor is removing regulations for Veterans' Employment Programs authorized under title IV, part
C, of the Job Training Partnership Act, administered by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment
and Training. This action is necessitated by the diminishing number of states applying for state formula-allocated
monies, and the need to improve the delivery of services. This action allows for the establishment of a more competitive
process to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to title IV, part C, of JTPA, the Secretary of Labor conducts programs to meet the employment and training
needs of service-connected disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era, and veterans who are recently separated
from military service. The programs are administered through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment
and Training, who conducts the programs through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements with public agencies
and private non-profit organizations.



The Department of Labor (DOL) originally issued regulations at 20 CFR part 1005 to define specifically the manner
in which the funds from this program would be disbursed. See 54 FR 39354 (September 26, 1980); and 48 FR 49198 (October
24, 1983). They provided for formula-based grants to States and required matching funds. However, the number of States
applying for title IV-C formula grants has diminished and the Department has determined that a competitive
methodology would more efficiently meet the needs of program participants. Program administration will be greatly
enhanced as the result of the elimination of those regulations, by increasing competition and lowering administrative
costs through larger grant awards. However, while this action removes those regulations, all specifications, special
conditions, 

etc

., that were in effect with the award of existing grants are binding until completion of the grant activity, including
information collection.
Part 1005 (1993 ed.) identified the process used to provide grant funds to states for Federal training programs for
veterans. A Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) will be developed and disseminated to eligible applicants
for the title IV-C program. The formula-based annual grants process is replaced by a multi-year competitive
grants process. This will result in fewer grants of greater dollar value, and will enable recipients of the grants
to provide expanded services to eligible veterans. By having larger, competitive grants, services can be targeted
to those eligible veterans most in need in areas of high impact, with greater customer satisfaction realized.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-0-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


It is now possible for JTPA title IV-C programs to be created to better enhance and complement other JTPA programs
that do not focus on veterans' services, while continuing efforts to improve the targeting of employment and training
services to eligible veterans who face serious barriers to employment. Larger multi-year grants allow for enhancement
of the quality of services provided and the outcomes attained by strengthening program activity through increased
efficiency in program scope and grant management, improving the linkages between services provided and local labor
market needs, and ensuring the provision of a coherent system of outcome-oriented human resource services through
changes in the direction and focus of the Veteran's Employment Programs to eligible veterans.



Immediate results will manifest themselves in the form of: eliminated regulations; fewer, but larger grants; establishment
of a system of awards through SGA's that can be renewed, modified or changed as deemed necessary. In addition, these
SGA's can be drawn to incorporate by reference the essential parts and requirements of the JTPA and the Departmental
JTPA regulations. See, 

e.g., 

20 CFR parts 627 and 636; and 29 CFR parts 96-98. For further information regarding the SGA or for copies, please
contact Mr. Jeffrey C. Crandall at the number provided above. A copy of the SGA will be published in the 

Federal Register

 in the immediate future.



This rulemaking supersedes that portion of the rulemaking announced at 56 FR 5124 (February 7, 1991) that related
to JTPA title IV-C programs.



Few comments were received in response to the publication of the proposed rule at 59 FR 10769 (March 8, 1994). One commenter
expressed total support for the action. Five commenters expressed concern that the action would have an adverse affect
upon small states, especially those small states with effective programs and proven track records although they
operated with the minimal amount of $55,000 under the formula-based funding process. In response, the competitive
process is to be structured to ensure that emphasis will be on the technical merits of the proposal and cost efficiency.
Thus, small states with effective programs should not be adversely affected.



One commenter expressed support for efforts to lower the program's administrative costs through larger grant amounts
and longer grant periods, but believed that a competitive bidding process is not as effective as an allocation formula
in ensuring that the dollars serve the intended clientele. He believed that an allocation component must be kept in
place that ensures that the bulk of the funding continues to go to those states in which the majority of veterans needing
service reside. In response, as stated above, due to funding limitations, the change from formula-based state allocated
funds to a nationwide competition was instituted to maximize service delivery and to target veterans most in need.
Other factors such as the technical merit of the proposal and cost efficiency will also be considered.





Publication in Final





For the reasons described above, and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), this rule is effective on the publication
date of this document. In light of the agency's desire to have an effective and efficient program, and in keeping with
mandates of the President to remove unnecessary and restrictive rules, it is in the public interest to eliminate those
regulations and establish a new system of grant administration for the title IV-C program. Given the impending
start of the program year, it is unnecessary and impracticable to delay the effective date.

Civil Actions by Persons Other Than Taxpayers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations adding language to the existing regulations regarding civil actions by
persons other than taxpayers, to clarify language that is ambiguous or confusing. The final regulations provide
that when the IRS levies on property that is in the custody of an agency of the Federal Government, a third party (i.e.,
someone other than the taxpayer) who is injured by such levy may have a cause of action against the Government for wrongful
levy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



This document contains final regulations amending the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26 CFR part 301)
under section 7426 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). On December 23, 1993, a notice of proposed rulemaking relating
to civil actions by persons other than taxpayers was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68092). No written comments were received. No public hearing was requested or held. Because no comments were
received, the proposed regulations under section 7426 are adopted without revision by this Treasury decision. The
preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking contains the explanation of the provisions of this Treasury decision.



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Jerome D. Sekula, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (General Litigation),
IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development.



List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 301



Employment taxes, Estate taxes, Excise taxes, Gift taxes, Income taxes, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping
requirements.



Adoption of Amendment to the Regulations



Accordingly, 26 CFR is amended as follows: 






Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows: 






Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *






Par. 2. 

Section 301.7426-1 is amended as follows: 




1. Paragraph (a)(1) is revised to read as set forth below.

2. Paragraph (c) is added to read as set forth below.



 301.7426-1 

Civil actions by persons other than taxpayers.



(a) 

Actions permitted

_(1) 

Wrongful levy

_(i) 

In general. 

If a levy has been made on property or property has been sold pursuant to a levy, any person (other than the person against
whom is assessed the tax out of which such levy arose) may bring a civil action against the United States in a district
court of the United States based upon such person's claim_

(A) That such person has an interest in, or lien on, such property which is senior to the interest of the United States;
and

(B) That such property was wrongfully levied upon.

(ii) 

Debt owed by another Federal agency. 

Section 7426 and this paragraph (a) apply when a levy is made by the Internal Revenue Service on a debt owed to a taxpayer
by another Federal agency. By contrast, section 7426 and this paragraph (a) do not apply if the Internal Revenue Service
requests payment from another Federal agency pursuant to a request for setoff.

Foreign Assets Control Regulations; Unblocking of Certain Bank Transfers Involving Vietnam


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Foreign Assets Control, Treasury.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As an additional step in the normalization of relations with Vietnam, the Treasury Department is amending the Foreign
Assets Control Regulations to authorize United States banking institutions to unblock certain funds which came
into their possession or control through wire transfer instructions or check remittances received after December
31, 1989, in which Vietnam or a Vietnamese national has or has had an interest.

WordPerfect 5.1 and ASCII.


Background


Effective February 3, 1994, the Office of Foreign Assets Control authorized new transactions involving property
in which Vietnam or its nationals have an interest, effectively lifting the embargo against that country for all new
transactions. Property blocked at that time, however, remained blocked. The Foreign Assets Control Regulations,
31 CFR part 500 (the ``Regulations''), are being amended to add  500.579, which authorizes banking institutions
subject to U.S. jurisdiction to unblock and return to the remitter certain funds that came into their possession or
control through wire transfer instructions or check remittances received after December 31, 1989. This general
license does not authorize the unblocking of funds in which Vietnam or a Vietnamese national has an interest that were
blocked as of February 3, 1994, other than wire transfers and check remittances blocked after December 31, 1989, which
are not being returned to the Government of Vietnam or persons in Vietnam. Nor does it affect enforcement actions involving
prior violations of the Regulations. 
Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, does not apply.


List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 500


Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, Banking, Finance, Foreign investments in U.S., Foreign trade, International
organizations, North Korea, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Services, Telecommunications,
Travel restrictions, Vietnam.



For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR part 500 is amended as set forth below:


PART 500_FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS


1. The authority citation for part 500 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 50 U.S.C. App. 1-44; E.O. 9193, 3 CFR, 1938-1943 Comp., p. 1174; E.O. 9989, 3 CFR 1943-1948 Comp.,
p. 748.




2. Section 500.579 is added to subpart E to read as follows:




Subpart E_Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy


 500.579 Authorization for release of certain blocked transfers by banking institutions subject to U.S. jurisdiction.


Banking institutions subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are authorized to unblock and return to the
remitting party funds that were blocked pursuant to this part because of an interest of Vietnam or a Vietnamese national
and that came into their possession or control by wire transfer or check remittance received after December 31, 1989,
provided that no funds are released to the Government of Vietnam or any person in Vietnam.

A. Regulatory History



In accordance with 21 CFR 10.85, Calgene, Inc., submitted to FDA on November 26, 1990, a request for advisory opinion
regarding whether the 

kan

r

 gene, a selectable marker, may be used in the production of genetically engineered tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape
plants intended for human food and animal feed uses (

kan

r

 Gene: Safety and use in the production of genetically engineered plants, Docket Number 90A-0416). In the 

Federal Register

 of May 1, 1991 (56 FR 20004), FDA announced that the request had been received and solicited comments from interested
persons. The data submitted to the agency with the request for advisory opinion and the comments received were made
available to the public at the Dockets Management Branch.

Subsequent to the submission of the request for advisory opinion, FDA published its ``Statement of Policy: Foods
Derived From New Plant Varieties'' (the 1992 policy statement) in the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984). This policy statement clarified FDA's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to human foods and animal feeds derived from new plant varieties, including plants
developed by new methods of genetic modification such as recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques.

In the 1992 policy statement, FDA stated that the postmarket authority under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C.
342(a)(1)) would continue to be the primary legal tool for ensuring the safety of whole foods derived from genetically
modified plants. FDA also noted that under the statutory definition of ``food additive'' in section 201(s) of the
act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the transferred genetic material and the intended expression products could be subject to
regulation as food additives, if such material or expression products were not generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
(57 FR 22984 at 22990). FDA further stated that the agency would use its food additive authority to the extent necessary
to ensure public health protection (such as when an intended expression product in a food differs significantly in
structure, function, or composition from substances found currently in food) (57 FR 22984 at 22990).

The 1992 policy statement specifically discussed selectable markers that provide antibiotic resistance in product
selection and development. With such markers, both the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene product, unless removed,
are expected to be present in foods derived from such plants. FDA stated:






Selectable marker genes that produce enzymes that inactivate clinically useful antibiotics theoretically may
reduce the therapeutic efficacy of the antibiotic when taken orally if the enzyme in the food inactivates the antibiotic.
FDA believes that it will be important to evaluate such concerns with respect to commercial use of antibiotic resistance
marker genes in food, especially those that will be widely used.






(See 57 FR 22984 at 22988.)






Subsequently, in January 1993, Calgene requested that FDA convert its request for advisory opinion to a food additive
petition under section 409 of the act. FDA then announced in the 

Federal Register

 of July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38429), that a food additive petition (FAP 3A4364) had been filed by Calgene, Inc., 1920 Fifth
St., Davis, CA 95616, proposing that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of APH(3
')II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton.

After completing its review of the data submitted by Calgene, FDA convened a public meeting of its Food Advisory Committee
on April 6 through 8, 1994, to undertake a scientific discussion of the agency's approach to evaluating the safety
of whole foods produced by new biotechnologies; a genetically modified tomato developed by Calgene containing the


kan

r

 gene served as an example and focus of the discussion. The membership of the standing committee was supplemented with
temporary members and consultants to the committee, representing scientific disciplines appropriate to the evaluation
of foods derived from new plant varieties developed using recombinant DNA techniques.

At the meeting, Calgene presented a summary of the data they considered adequate to show safety of the tomato, and FDA
presented its evaluation of the data. The committee was asked to comment on the approach used by FDA to evaluate whole
foods and specifically, on the approach used for the Calgene tomato (Ref. 1). During committee discussion of the Calgene
and FDA presentations, the committee members generally expressed the view that the approach used by FDA to evaluate
the safety of the tomato, including the safety of the 

kan

r

 gene, was appropriate and that all relevant scientific questions had been adequately addressed.

In regard to the use of the 

kan

r

 gene, Calgene and the agency presented, and the committee discussed, such issues as the potential allergenicity
of APH(3
')II and the potential for ingested APH(3
')II to inactivate orally administered antibiotics. Most of the discussion concerning the 

kan

r

 gene focused on the potential transfer of the gene to microorganisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or in the environment.
In evaluating Calgene's food additive petition for the use of the 

kan

r

 gene product, APH(3
')II, in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton, FDA has considered the committee's
discussions and recommendations on this subject, which are summarized in section III.B.3. of this document. 


B. Scope of the Regulation 


Having completed its evaluation and having considered the deliberations of the Food Advisory Committee, the agency
is amending the food additive regulations to permit the use of APH(3
')II in the development of genetically modified tomatoes, oilseed rape, and cotton intended for food use.
Only the translation product of the 

kan

r

 gene, APH(3
')II, and not the gene itself, is being regulated as a food additive. As the 1992 policy statement indicated,
FDA does not anticipate that transferred genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) would itself be regulated
as a food additive (57 FR 22984 at 22990). DNA is present in the cells of all living organisms, including every plant
and animal used for food by humans or animals, and is efficiently digested (Ref. 2). In this respect, the DNA that makes
up the 

kan

r

 gene does not differ from any other DNA and does not itself pose a safety concern as a component of food. 
This final rule is being promulgated after consideration of the issues relating to the safety of the use of APH(3
')II in the selection of transgenic plants. In addition, as noted above, because of the property of the 

kan

r

 gene to confer antibiotic resistance, the agency has considered the possibility that the gene might be transferred
to other organisms (discussed in section III.B. of this document). 
Potential safety issues specific to particular food products that contain the 

kan

r

 gene are not addressed by the agency in this document because such issues are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. For
example, issues associated with other co-transferred DNA sequences, including other genes intended to impart specific
traits, and issues related to potential genetic instability are not addressed because such issues will vary with
specific products. 
Developers of new plant varieties are responsible for addressing potential safety issues associated with specific
food products resulting from the transfer of genetic materials and for ensuring the safety of the food products that
they market. The policy statement contains a ``Guidance to Industry'' section (57 FR 22984 at 22991) that outlines
an approach for the safety evaluation of foods derived from transgenic plants and suggests that the agency be consulted,
as needed, to resolve critical issues. 
As noted, issues related to genetic instability are not addressed because such issues are not unique to the 

kan

r

 gene but apply to any transferred genetic material irrespective of the transfer techniques used. Genetic instability
could arise as a result of insertion of multiple copies of a given construct, especially if insertion occurs at multiple
loci. Recombinations of the transferred DNA could cause deletions, duplications, or rearrangements within the
plant genome (Ref. 3). Hence, in the 1992 policy statement, the agency noted that the genetic stability of a new plant
variety is an important safety consideration and further stated that, ``Factors that favor stability include a minimum
number of copies of the introduced genetic material, and insertion at a single site.'' (57 FR 22984 at 23004). 
In developing new plant varieties, developers are therefore responsible for following good manufacturing and good
agricultural practices to ensure that they have developed a genetically stable transgenic plant. As a practical
matter, this would ordinarily include using such techniques as segregation and Southern blot analysis to ensure
that new plant varieties chosen for development have the new genetic material inserted into a single locus and that
the number of copies of inserted DNA at a given site is limited to the minimum sufficient to achieve the intended effect.

C. Determination of Safety 


Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in the
Food Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative history of the provision: ``Safety requires proof
of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not_and cannot_require
proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will result under any conceivable circumstance.'' (H. Rept. 2284, 85th
Cong., 2d sess. (1958)). FDA has incorporated this concept of safety into its food additive regulations. Under 21
CFR 170.3(i), a food additive is ``safe'' if ``there is a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists
that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.'' 
The agency has reviewed the data and studies submitted in the request for advisory opinion, material that was submitted
subsequent to the conversion of the request for advisory opinion to a food additive petition, the deliberations of
the Food Advisory Committee that took place at the April 1994 meeting, as well as other information in its files. In
addition, the agency has considered the comments that were received in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice announcing receipt of the request for advisory opinion. The comments are addressed in section IV. of this document.
As discussed below, FDA has concluded, based upon its review, that the use of aminoglycoside 3
'-phosphotransferase II is safe for use as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed
rape, and cotton intended for food use. 


II. Use of the 

kan

r

 Gene As a Selectable Marker in Transgenic Plants


A. Background


Developers have for many years used plant breeding techniques to introduce desirable genetic traits into new varieties
that can be used in agriculture. Traditionally, breeders have relied on selection of mutants and on hybridization
between different varieties of the same species to achieve this goal. More recently, recombinant DNA techniques
(commonly referred to as ``genetic engineering'' techniques) have come into use to generate new plant varieties
with desirable characteristics. Recombinant DNA techniques involve the isolation, and subsequent introduction
into a host plant, of discrete DNA segments containing the gene(s) of interest. This introduction of exogenous DNA
into a cell, resulting in its acquisition of a new phenotype, is commonly referred to as ``transformation,'' and transformed
plants that contain genetic material derived from sources other than the host plant itself are called transgenic.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The desired gene(s) may be introduced into a host plant by one of several methods, including: (1) Direct DNA uptake
by the plant cells mediated by chemical or electrical treatments; (2) microinjection of DNA directly into plant cells;
(3) biolistics, or firing tiny particles coated with the DNA of interest into plant cells; and (4) the use of a bacterium,
such as the soil bacterium 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 

as a vehicle to carry the DNA into plant cells. (For a discussion of these processes, see Ref. 4).


B. Need for a Selectable Marker


Transformation of plant cells by introducing exogenous DNA is an inefficient process and, in general, only a small
proportion of cells will successfully take up, integrate, and express the new genetic material (Ref. 5). Further,
the few cells that do so are not readily distinguishable from the vast majority of cells that do not. Therefore, developers
of transgenic plants need a means to distinguish cells that are successfully transformed from those that are not.
Selectable markers, such as the 

kan



r

 gene, perform this function.
The 

kan



r

 gene is linked to the gene (or genes) of interest and then this genetic material is inserted into plant cells. Because
plant cells are sensitive to the antibiotic kanamycin, incorporation of the 

kan



r

 gene into cells and subsequent expression of APH(3
')II provides a convenient method for selecting successfully transformed cells. 

Kan



r

 works as a marker because only successfully transformed cells (which contain both the 

kan



r

 and the desired genetic material) survive when grown in a kanamycin-containing medium. These cells are subsequently
regenerated into transgenic plants. 


C. Identity of the Additive


APH(3
')II

1

 (CAS Reg. No. 58943-39-8) is encoded by the 

kan



r

 gene, which was originally isolated as a component of transposon Tn

5



2

 from the bacterium 

Escherichia coli 

(Refs. 6 and 7). APH(3
')II is an enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 25,000 that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group
from adenosine 5
'-triphosphate (ATP) to a hydroxyl group of aminoglycoside antibiotics (see below), thereby inactivating
the antibiotics.





APH(3
')II inactivates the aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, ribostamycin, gentamicins
A and B, as well as butirosins (Refs. 8 and 9). Of the antibiotics that are inactivated by APH(3
')II, only neomycin and kanamycin are currently approved for use in humans or animals in the United States (Refs.
10 and 11).

3






The APH(3
')II evaluated in this document is the enzyme whose synthesis is directed by the 

kan



r

 gene derived from transposon Tn

5

. This enzyme is not to be confused with enzymes that may be similarly named (e.g., a type I aminoglycoside phosphotransferase
encoded by a gene isolated from transposon Tn601) or other bacterial enzymes (including acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases,
and phosphotransferases) that inactivate kanamycin and neomycin (Refs. 8 and 12).


D. Use and Intended Technical Effects


Aminoglycoside antibiotics exert their effect on bacteria by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein
synthesis. Phosphorylation of the antibiotics by APH(3
')II interferes with this binding and thus prevents the antibiotics from inhibiting protein synthesis (Ref.
13). In this way, cells that contain the 

kan



r

 gene and that express APH(3
')II are rendered resistant to the action of the antibiotics. In plant cells, the antibiotics exert their effect
on mitochondria and chloroplasts where protein synthesis takes place on ribosomes that resemble bacterial ribosomes
(Ref. 14).
The proposed use of the 

kan



r

 gene and gene product APH(3
')II is as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape intended
for food use. As discussed above, because transformation of plant cells is an inefficient process, the presence of
APH(3
')II and the consequent ability of the plant cells to grow in the presence of antibiotics is used to distinguish
between transformed and nontransformed cells. Therefore, the intended technical effect of APH(3
')II is to permit, in the early phases of development of genetically modified plants, the selection of transformants
carrying the 

kan



r

 gene along with the genetic material of interest. However, APH(3
')II has no intended technical effect in the final plant or final crop product.


III. Safety Evaluation


A. APH(3
')II


Safety issues associated with APH(3
')II can be divided into two areas: (1) Those associated with the direct effects of ingestion of the protein,
including the possibility of allergenicity; and (2) those associated with the biological activity of APH(3
')II (i.e., the effect of the enzyme on the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered antibiotics).

<TEXT>
 

1. Direct Effects of Ingestion


Calgene provided evidence that APH(3
')II is rapidly inactivated by stomach acid, is degraded by digestive enzymes, and is not modified by glycosylation
(i.e., does not contain sugar molecules attached to the protein) when produced in the transgenic plants under consideration.
In addition, Calgene noted that enzymes such as APH(3
')II are heat labile. Thus, Calgene concluded that APH(3
')II does not possess any of the characteristics associated with allergenic proteins such as proteolytic
stability, glycosylation, or heat stability (Ref. 15). In April 1992, Calgene also conducted protein and DNA sequence
comparisons using sequences in four separate databases (GenBank, EMBL, PIR 29, and Swiss-Prot) and established
that APH(3
')II does not have significant homology to any proteins listed as food allergens or toxins in these databases.
FDA agrees with Calgene that the characteristics of APH(3
')II do not raise a safety concern. First, each whole food, on average, contains several thousands of different
proteins (Ref. 16). As a class, proteins are rarely toxic (Ref. 17) and APH(3
')II is not known to be toxic. Second, APH(3
')II is a phosphorylating enzyme, and all plants and animals that are part of the food supply contain such phosphorylating
enzymes without adverse consequences. Third, APH(3
')II has been shown to be rapidly degraded under simulated gastric conditions (Refs. 18 through 21). Finally,
the estimated dietary exposure to APH(3
')II is very low (480  u g APH(3
')II per person per day,

4

 or 0.16 part per million in the diet, based on a 100-percent market share for tomatoes containing APH(3
')II (Ref. 18)).




Based upon the available evidence, the agency believes that this protein does not possess any properties that would
distinguish it toxicologically from other phosphorylating enzymes in the food supply. Further, because of the low
exposure levels and normal digestibility of APH(3
')II, the agency concludes that no limits other than good manufacturing practice are needed to ensure the safety
of the petitioned use of APH(3
')II (Ref. 20).

2. Effects on the Therapeutic Efficacy of Orally Administered Antibiotics


a. 

APH(3
')II in human foods. 

i. 

Relevant source of APH(3
')II. 

Calgene considered whether APH(3
')II could affect the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered aminoglycoside antibiotics. In doing
so, Calgene stated that only APH(3
')II from fresh tomatoes is relevant because it is the only form that is enzymatically active. Processed tomato
products (such as processed whole tomatoes, chili, juice, pulp, paste, catsup, and soup) are subjected to temperatures
in the range of 82 to 100 
 C; these temperatures would be expected to inactivate the APH(3
')II enzyme. For edible oils extracted from cottonseed and rapeseed, high temperature treatment, solvent
extraction, and subsequent purification steps generally included in the processing of such oils would also be expected
to inactivate APH(3
')II.
FDA agrees that high temperature treatment denatures proteins and inactivates enzymes and therefore, processed
products that contain tomatoes with the 

kan



r

 gene are unlikely to contain any enzymatically active APH(3
')II. In addition, purified oils essentially do not contain protein; therefore, oils derived from transgenic
cottonseed and rapeseed modified using the 

kan



r

 gene would not be expected to contain active or inactive APH(3
')II (Refs. 18 and 23). Thus, FDA agrees that fresh tomatoes from plants developed using the 

kan



r

 gene are the only source of active APH(3
')II.

ii. 

Effect of APH(3
')II in fresh tomatoes on the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered antibiotics. 

Calgene performed several experiments intended to address whether APH(3
')II consumed as a component of fresh tomatoes could render orally-administered kanamycin ineffective.
These experiments were performed under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions (i.e., appropriate pH, reagent
concentrations, temperature, and reaction times) chosen to reflect conditions expected in vivo. In some studies
both tomato extract and nonfat milk were added to determine whether the presence of additional food-source proteins
in the simulated gastric and intestinal fluids might slow the proteolytic degradation of APH(3
')II by competition. After evaluating the loss of immunologically detectable APH(3
')II, Calgene concluded that, under normal gastric and intestinal conditions, APH(3
')II would be effectively degraded before the enzyme could inactivate kanamycin or neomycin and therefore,
APH(3
')II would not interfere with orally administered kanamycin or neomycin therapy. The results of Calgene's
experiments were the same whether done in the presence or the absence of tomato extract and nonfat milk. 

In addition, Calgene presented the results of in vitro degradation studies performed under simulated abnormal gastric
conditions, such as may exist in patients treated with drugs that reduce stomach acidity. Calgene stated that these
studies demonstrated that APH(3
')II is not degraded in neutralized (pH 7.0) simulated gastric fluid and thus, APH(3
')II may remain active in such abnormal gastric conditions. However, Calgene pointed out that, even under
those conditions, APH(3
')II would not be expected to inactivate orally administered kanamycin or neomycin because the concentration
of ATP, which the enzyme requires to inactivate kanamycin and neomycin, would be limiting. In support of this contention,
Calgene presented data from the published literature on ATP levels in fresh fruits and vegetables. Calgene then estimated
ATP intake and calculated the fraction of neomycin that would be phosphorylated assuming that all of the available
ATP reacted with the antibiotic. Under the worst-case situation (high intake of ATP-containing food, low dose of
antibiotic) Calgene's calculations showed that only a small fraction (no more than 1.5 percent) of the antibiotic
would be inactivated. Moreover, Calgene presented data that showed that no significant inactivation of kanamycin
was observed during in vitro studies conducted with tomato extract containing APH(3
')II and kanamycin over a 4-hour incubation period. 

iii. 

Agency conclusions. 

The agency has evaluated the data and other information presented by Calgene (Refs. 18 through 21 and 24). FDA agrees
that Calgene's in vitro digestion studies show that, as is the case for dietary protein in general, the biological
activity of APH(3
')II is destroyed during gastric and intestinal phases of digestion. Further, the agency has determined that
any active APH(3
')II that might remain would not significantly inactivate kanamycin or neomycin in the gut because the small
amount of ATP in fruits and vegetables would limit the amount of antibiotic that could be phosphorylated. ATP is an
extremely labile molecule that is susceptible to inactivation both by heat (e.g., cooking) and by enzymes, such as
alkaline phosphatases (Ref. 25), that are found in the intestine. Because the ATP in meat, poultry, fish, and cooked
vegetables would be broken down by cooking, the primary source of ATP in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of patients
would be uncooked fruits and vegetables. However, the amount of ATP in a variety of fruits and vegetables would provide
enough ATP to inactivate only a small percentage of kanamycin or neomycin, even if one makes the conservative assumption
that all of the ATP in these fruits and vegetables would survive the alkaline phosphatases in the intestines and would
be available for catalytic phosphorylation of kanamycin or neomycin. 

In addition, the agency has considered the patient population likely to be exposed to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
Oral aminoglycosides are most commonly administered to either pre-operative patients (prior to bowel surgery)
or patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Neither patient population would be expected to be ingesting tomatoes
or any other fresh fruits and vegetables; therefore there is little or no risk of inactivating the oral antibiotic
in these patients (Refs. 24 and 26). For these reasons, FDA concludes that the presence of APH(3
')II in food will not compromise the therapeutic use of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin.

b. 

APH(3
')II in animal feed. 

Calgene also considered the potential inactivation of neomycin that is used in animal feeds manufactured using cottonseed
meal and rapeseed meal obtained from transgenic plants. The transgenic tomato was not considered because only small
amounts of tomato and tomato byproducts are used in the animal feed industry. Further, neomycin is primarily used
to treat calves and swine whereas tomato byproducts, to the extent that they are used in animal feed, are primarily
used as ingredients in cattle diets (Ref. 27). 

Calgene analyzed neomycin levels both in nontransgenic medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals and in transgenic
medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals over a storage period of 56 days (considered a worst-case situation) and
concluded that there was no significant inactivation of neomycin. 

FDA reviewed the data submitted by Calgene and concludes that there was no significant difference with respect to
neomycin stability between medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals prepared from transgenic cottonseed and rapeseed
containing APH(3
')II, and appropriate controls (Ref. 28). Therefore, the agency concludes that transgenic strains of cottonseed
and rapeseed containing APH(3
')II have no apparent untoward effect regarding the stability of neomycin and that the therapeutic efficacy
of neomycin in animal feed will not be affected. The agency also considers this conclusion applicable to other aminoglycoside
antibiotics, e.g., gentamicin, when orally administered.



B. The Kan

r

 Gene 



The agency also evaluated issues relevant specifically to the safety of the use of the 

kan

r

 gene in tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. In particular, FDA evaluated the potential for horizontal transfer of the
gene and subsequent expansion of the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The agency evaluated whether
efficacy of oral antibiotic treatment of humans or animals could be compromised by consumption of food containing
the 

kan

r

 gene either because of the development of resistant intestinal microflora in humans and animals or because the cells
lining the intestinal lumen might become transformed. In addition, the agency considered the possible transfer
of the 

kan

r

 gene from transgenic plants to soil microorganisms and expansion of the antibiotic-resistant bacterial population.




1. Potential Transfer of the 

kan

r

 Gene to Intestinal Microorganisms and Cells Lining the Intestinal Lumen 



Calgene presented theoretical and experimental evidence to demonstrate that the potential for compromise of antibiotic
therapy by horizontal transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene to gut microorganisms or intestinal epithelial cells is not of significant concern. Calgene considered the
sources of the 

kan

r

 gene, the role digestion plays in degrading DNA, and possible DNA transfer mechanisms. 

a. 

Relevant source of the kan

r

 gene available for transformation. 

Calgene considered potential transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene only from fresh tomatoes because processing is expected to inactivate the 

kan

r

 gene in processed tomato products and in food products derived from cotton and oilseed rape. The 

kan

r

 gene is not expected to survive procedures used to process tomatoes because heating processes, such as those used
in commercial processing, can directly degrade DNA or can damage DNA by releasing cellular DNA-degrading enzymes.


The 

kan

r

 gene is also not expected to survive the process of oil production from cottonseed and rapeseed. Mechanical grinding
or flaking of oilseeds during the production of oils and meals from oilseeds is expected to liberate degradative enzymes
normally present within the cell that would degrade the 

kan

r

 gene. In addition, oil processing also includes high temperatures and solvent extractions, both of which would be
expected to inactivate the 

kan

r

 gene. Moreover, because DNA is hydrophilic, it is unlikely to fractionate into oil, which is hydrophobic, during
the extraction of oil from cottonseed and rapeseed. Therefore, intact DNA, including the 

kan

r

 gene, is not expected to survive the production of oils and animal feeds from cottonseed and rapeseed. 

b. 

Effect of digestion on the availability of the kan

r

 gene for possible transformation. 

Calgene demonstrated that most if not all of the DNA comprising the 

kan

r

 gene ingested by humans will be degraded in the stomach and upper small intestine before it reaches the lower small
intestine, cecum, and colon, and would be unavailable for potential transformation of gut microorganisms. Calgene
estimated that 99.9 percent of fresh tomato DNA would be digested to fragments smaller than 1,000 base pairs. This
estimate was based on in vitro studies that found that only 0.1 percent of DNA could be detected as fragments of 1,000
base pairs or longer after exposure to stomach-simulating fluids for 10 minutes and to intestinal-simulating fluids
for another 10 minutes. Thus most of the DNA remaining after digestion would be smaller than the 

kan

r

 gene which is about 1,000 base pairs long.

Regarding animal feed, food-producing animals consume primarily processed forms of cottonseed and rapeseed, in
which, as discussed above, the 

kan



r

 gene is not expected to remain intact. In addition, researchers have shown that nucleic acids introduced into the
rumens of calves, or incubated with calf, sheep, or cow rumen contents in vitro, were rapidly and completely degraded
to nucleotides and nucleosides (Ref. 29). 
c. 

Calculation of worst-case transformation frequencies. 


In its submission, Calgene addressed the potential for horizontal transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene. Natural transformation, i.e., the uptake and incorporation into the genome of free DNA, is known to occur in
some bacterial species. This is the only possible mechanism by which intestinal microflora could take up free DNA
(Ref. 30). However, none of the species known to be present in the GI tract has been found capable of acquiring exogenous
DNA by natural transformation. Nonetheless, to consider the worst-case scenario, Calgene assumed that all microbes
in the intestine would be able to take up and incorporate exogenous DNA at a frequency found for certain species of the
genus 

Streptococcus. 

Calgene noted that although the firm developed its transformation model for certain 

Streptococcus 

species, they are not aware of any information indicating that 

Streptococcus

 species found in the GI tract can be naturally transformed. 
To undergo natural transformation, the recipient bacterium must be transformation-competent, i.e., ready to take
up DNA. As noted, none of the bacterial species that occur in the GI tract is known to be capable of becoming transformation-competent.
In addition, the genome of a recipient bacterium should contain DNA homologous to the incoming DNA (Refs. 31 and 32).
Because the genomes of intestinal 

Streptococci 

or other intestinal bacteria are not expected to exhibit homology to the DNA constructs containing the 

kan



r

 gene

6

, Calgene assumed that the 

kan



r

 gene could only undergo ``illegitimate'' recombination, a process that does not require significant DNA homology.
Calgene noted that illegitimate recombination occurs in microorganisms at a much lower rate than homologous recombination.






Under the foregoing worst-case assumptions, Calgene estimated that if a person consumes fresh tomatoes at the 90th
percentile level (i.e., eats more tomatoes than 89 percent of the individuals in the population), the transformation
frequency of the intestinal microorganisms with the 

kan



r

 gene will be approximately 3 x 10

^15 

transformants per day. This transformation frequency is more than 5 orders of magnitude less than the frequency of
mutation to kanamycin resistance per bacterial replication, i.e., 10

^9

 (Ref. 12). Thus, Calgene showed that for every 300,000 bacteria that mutate to kanamycin resistance per replication
(generally a matter of hours), there would be, at most, under worst-case conditions, one kanamycin-resistant bacterium
per day added to that number due to transformation. 
Calgene stated that the potential for food-producing animals to experience decreased efficacy of antibiotic therapy
as a result of pathogenic intestinal microflora incorporating and expressing the 

kan



r

 gene would be similar to that described for humans, i.e., equally improbable. In reaching this conclusion, Calgene
relied on the finding that DNA is rapidly and completely digested in the gut of food animals (Ref. 29) and on the contention
that the worst-case transformation scenario described above for human gut microorganisms also applies to microorganisms
found in the gut of food-producing animals. 
With respect to epithelial cells lining the intestinal lumen, Calgene provided information that no transformation
of human epithelial cells has been demonstrated in vivo (Ref. 2). In addition, even if transformed, intestinal epithelial
cells are terminally differentiated (i.e., do not divide) and have a relatively short life span (Ref. 34), and thus
would continually be shed and replaced by nontransformed cells. 


2. Potential Transfer of the 

kan



r

 Gene to Soil Microorganisms 


Calgene also considered the possibility that the 

kan



r

 gene might be transferred to soil microorganisms, thereby increasing the level of antibiotic-resistant organisms
in the environment. Calgene pointed out that the only plausible mechanism by which gene transfer could occur between
plants and bacteria is through natural transformation. Taking this mechanism into consideration and using worst-case
assumptions similar to those discussed above for intestinal microorganisms, Calgene calculated that, at worst,
kanamycin-resistant transformants resulting from plant DNA left in the fields would represent not more than one
in 10 million of the existing kanamycin-resistant soil population.

3. Food Advisory Committee Discussions Regarding Potential Horizontal Transfer of the 

Kan



r

 Gene 



As part of its discussion of the scientific issues related to the evaluation of Calgene's genetically engineered
tomato, the Food Advisory Committee discussed the possibility that the 

kan



r

 gene might be transferred to microorganisms in the GI tract and in the environment (Ref. 1). 
The committee members concluded that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene consumed as a component of tomatoes to microorganisms in the GI tract was highly unlikely based on published data
in the scientific literature. Similarly, the committee members judged that the potential for transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene from plants to microorganisms in the environment is highly unlikely based on the members' knowledge of mechanisms
of gene transfer. In addition, members of the committee pointed out that the rate at which such transfer could take
place, if at all, was of so small a magnitude that, coupled with the high prevalence of kanamycin resistant organisms
already present in the environment, it would not cause a significant environmental impact. 
Some members of the committee, while convinced by the information presented at the meeting that the transfer of the


kan



r

 gene from tomato plants to microorganisms in the soil was improbable, expressed concern regarding the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops that may be grown on a wide scale. In addition, some committee members were concerned that a determination
of safety with regard to the use of 

kan



r

 gene in Calgene's tomato might signal to producers that it is now permissible to use the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops. In light of such concerns, these committee members advised that use of the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 


4. Agency Conclusions 


The agency has considered the recommendations of the members of the Food Advisory Committee. The agency agrees that
the potential transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene, as well as other antibiotic resistance marker genes, from crops to microorganisms should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis. As noted, Calgene petitioned for the use of the 

kan



r

 gene product, APH(3
')II, in the development of genetically engineered cotton and oilseed rape in addition to tomato. As discussed
below, the agency has evaluated data and information concerning horizontal transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene from its use in all three crops. This is consistent with the committee's advice that safety of the use of the 

kan



r

 gene be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In addition, Calgene's petition seeks to amend the food additive regulations
to permit the use of APH(3
')II only in tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape; approval of Calgene's petition would not mean that developers
could use the 

kan



r

 gene in crops other than those identified in the petition. 
FDA has also evaluated the information submitted by Calgene and has determined that the probability of transfer of
the 

kan



r

 gene to gut microflora is remote and that even under worst-case conditions, the number of microorganisms that would
be converted to kanamycin resistance is negligible when compared to the reported prevalence of gut microflora that
are already resistant to kanamycin (Ref. 35). This conclusion applies to both humans and animals. The agency has determined
that exposure to foods that contain the 

kan



r

 gene will not compromise the efficacy of antibiotic treatment because the likelihood of increasing the number of
antibiotic resistant microorganisms is extremely low. Further, the agency has determined that there is no evidence
that free DNA containing the 

kan



r

 gene, even if present, can transform cells lining the GI tract (Ref. 2).

FDA has also evaluated the information submitted by Calgene concerning soil microorganisms and agrees with Calgene
that there would be no increase in kanamycin-resistant soil microorganisms because it is highly unlikely that the


kan



r

 gene could move from the plant genome into soil microorganisms via horizontal gene transfer. Further, the agency
has determined that, even if such transfer could occur, the rate at which it could occur is such that it would not result
in a detectable increase over the existing background population of kanamycin-resistant bacteria (Ref. 36). Based
on the foregoing, FDA has concluded that the use of the 

kan



r

 gene does not pose safety concerns in terms of increase in the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to
the potential for horizontal transfer of the gene.


IV. Response to Comments


FDA received 47 comments on Calgene's request for an advisory opinion on the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton plants. Comments were received from members
of academia, industry and industry-related organizations, State and Federal agencies, environmental groups and
other nonprofit organizations, and individual consumers. Additionally, several comments on the agency's 1992
policy statement addressed the use of the 

kan



r

 gene.
Most of the comments supported the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in crop development, stating that there were no health or environmental issues precluding its use. Several comments
expressed opinions on a wide range of issues including regulatory approaches for genetically engineered foods,
concerns relating to human and animal food safety, and to the environmental effects of the 

kan



r

 gene, and whether foods containing the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
')II should be specially labeled.


A. Regulatory Issues


Some comments stated that it was not appropriate for FDA to evaluate the safety of the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
')II under an advisory opinion and that the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
')II should be treated as food additives by FDA. FDA has discussed above the basis for its decision not to regulate
the DNA that makes up the 

kan



r

 gene itself as a food additive. Further, in light of Calgene's conversion of its request for advisory opinion on the
use of the 

kan



r

 gene to a food additive petition, the comment concerning the regulation of APH(3
')II as a food additive no longer requires a response.


B. Food Safety


Several comments stated that the presence in food of APH(3
')II raised no food safety concerns whatsoever. Others questioned whether Calgene had supplied adequate
data to ensure the safety of the 

kan



r

 gene and gene product, APH(3
')II, when present in food. The substantive questions raised are discussed in sections IV.B.1 through 5 of
this document.


1. Glycosylation


Two comments stated that APH(3
')II might be glycosylated (i.e., might contain sugar molecules attached to the protein via the amino acid
asparagine (N-linked) or via the amino acids serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline (O-linked)) when produced in
tomatoes or other plants and, therefore, might become a food allergen. One of the comments asserted that for this reason,
Calgene should be required to test whether APH(3
')II is glycosylated. The comments, however, did not provide any information showing that glycosylated APH(3
')II is likely to be, or is, allergenic.
At this time, FDA is unaware of any practical method to predict or assess the potential for new proteins in food to induce
allergenicity. Although many food allergens that have been characterized at a structural level are glycosylated
(Ref. 37), the agency is not aware of any information on structural or other properties of glycosylated proteins that
would be predictive of their allergenicity. As noted, the comments did not provide such information. Moreover, glycosylated
proteins are widespread in food. For these reasons, glycosylation is not a useful positive predictor of a potential
allergenic effect. Accordingly, FDA did not request that Calgene determine whether APH(3
')II is glycosylated.
Nevertheless, in a submission dated October 24, 1991, entitled ``Response to Public Comments,'' Calgene addressed
whether APH(3
')II is likely to be glycosylated and concluded that it is not. Calgene noted that APH(3
')II lacks the amino terminal sequence of amino acids (commonly referred to as a ``signal peptide'') that is
necessary to direct the protein into the cellular compartments where glycosylation occurs. Calgene also asserted
that the unchanged molecular weight of APH(3
')II in plants (relative to the molecular weight of bacterial APH(3
')II, which is not glycosylated) supports the conclusion that APH(3
')II is not glycosylated in plants. Finally, Calgene stated that the amino acid sequence (asparagine-X-serine/threonine)
that is required to direct N-linked glycosylation to specific asparagine moieties is not present in APH(3
')II. (Calgene noted that a corresponding argument for the lack of the appropriate amino acid sequence to direct
O-linked glycosylation cannot be made because the sequences that direct O-linked glycosylation have not been defined.)
FDA has considered the information and arguments submitted in the comments and Calgene's response and has concluded
that the available evidence indicates that APH(3
')II is not glycosylated in plants. However, even if glycosylation had been demonstrated, FDA emphasizes
that glycosylation alone does not necessarily establish that APH(3
')II is likely to produce an allergenic response because the positive predictive value of glycosylation with
respect to the potential for inducing allergenicity has not been demonstrated.

2. In Vitro Digestibility Studies


In its original submission, Calgene presented the results of in vitro digestibility studies that demonstrated that
APH(3
')II enzymatic activity is rapidly decreased in simulated gastric fluid and in simulated intestinal fluid.
One comment asserted that Calgene should provide a more thorough study of degradation of APH(3
')II in the digestive tract because the conditions of the in vitro digestibility study submitted by Calgene
did not fully mimic the complex environments of the human gut. The comment further asserted that it was not clear whether
the digestibility data also apply to neonates and to people with coeliac disorders or ulcers who can absorb peptides
and intact proteins through their intestines. The comment noted that the applicability of the data to neonates would
be of special importance should 

kan



r

 be used in soybeans because soy protein is a major component of some infant formulas. Importantly, however, the comment
presented no information to provide a basis for concluding that the absorption of APH(3
')II occurs, or that if it does, such absorption presents a health concern greater than that posed by the absorption
of any other protein in the diet.
As discussed above, FDA has evaluated the studies presented by Calgene to demonstrate the normal digestibility of
the enzyme and concurs with Calgene's conclusion that APH(3
')II is rapidly degraded under normal conditions in the GI tract. Therefore, FDA believes that the intestinal
transfer of intact or large fragments of APH(3
')II is not likely to occur in individuals with normal GI tracts.
In regard to the possibility of increased intestinal absorption of proteins in neonates and individuals with special
conditions (e.g., ulcers), FDA has concluded that there is no reason to expect that absorption of the intact or partially
digested APH(3
')II protein would present a safety problem different from absorption of any other protein in the diet. As discussed
above, proteins, as a class, are rarely toxic. Furthermore, APH(3
')II is a phosphorylating enzyme and does not contain any properties that would distinguish it toxicologically
from any other phosphorylating enzymes that historically have been part of the food supply without adverse consequences.
Finally, because Calgene did not petition FDA for the use of APH(3
')II in soybeans, it is not necessary to address the comment concerning the applicability of Calgene's digestibility
data to neonates fed soybean-derived formulas.


3. Copy Number of the 

kan



r

 Gene and Expression Level of APH(3
')II


In its submission of November 26, 1990, Calgene stated that it did not intend to commercialize lines that contained
more than 10 copies of the 

kan



r

 gene. In addition, Calgene also declared that, in tomatoes, the APH(3
')II level would be no more than 0.1 percent of the total protein of the tomato and that processing procedures
would destroy APH(3
')II in processed tomatoes and edible oils extracted from cottonseed and rapeseed.
One comment asserted that Calgene inadequately described the methods by which it would ensure that no lines with greater
than 10 copies of the 

kan



r

 gene would be marketed. The comment further asserted that many of the analyses offered by Calgene to prove the safety
of the 

kan



r

 gene depend on estimates of the number of genes per cell and that, if the company cannot ensure this relatively low level
of gene incorporation, many of its safety arguments are undermined. The comment, however, did not identify which
of Calgene's safety analyses depended on estimates of the numbers of genes per cell.
The comment may have been referring to Calgene's assumption that each plant cell would contain 10 copies of the gene
when it calculated a worst-case frequency of transformation of microorganisms with the 

kan



r

 gene that would result from use of the gene in transgenic plants. However, the agency notes that the outcome of those
calculations, i.e., Calgene's conclusion that the transformation frequency of microorganisms with the 

kan



r

 gene is insignificant, would not change had Calgene assumed much higher gene copy numbers in its calculations. Therefore,
FDA's safety assessment does not depend on precise estimates of gene copy number. Nor does the comment provide a basis
for concluding that it is necessary to have precise methods for ensuring that no plants with more than 10 copies of the
gene will be marketed.
A second comment maintained that Calgene provided an inadequate description of the quality control and assurance
procedures the company would use to ensure that APH(3
')II would be kept to no more than 0.1 percent of total protein of the tomato, and that a number of the company's
safety analyses rely on the amount of APH(3
')II in the food. The comment, however, did not identify which of Calgene's safety analyses relied on estimates
of the concentration of APH(3
')II in the food.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-0-00044 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FDA has determined that there is no need to set a tolerance for the amount of APH(3
')II that will be consumed because the agency knows of no reason why this protein would have any properties that
would distinguish it toxicologically from any other phosphorylating enzymes in the food supply. Also, as discussed
above, APH(3
')II will not affect efficacy of orally administered antibiotics because APH(3
')II is rapidly digested under normal conditions in the GI tract, and even in abnormal gastric conditions where
APH(3
')II may not be rapidly digested, the amount of ATP available in food would allow only a small proportion of kanamycin
and neomycin to be inactivated. Therefore, the agency concludes that there is no need to require quality control and
assurance procedures to ensure that the APH(3
')II level will be no more than 0.1 percent of the total protein in commercial tomato varieties. 

A third comment argued that Calgene did not provide data to establish that APH(3
')II would not be present after tomato processing and after extraction of edible oils. 

The agency's exposure estimates included an assumption that APH(3
')II would be present in both processed tomatoes and fresh tomatoes even though the high temperatures involved
in processing inactivate enzymes and therefore, processed tomato products are unlikely to contain enzymatically
active APH(3
')II (Ref. 18). In addition, well-established processing procedures used to extract edible oils from oilseed
crops do not extract significant amounts of protein (Ref. 23). Therefore, exposure to APH(3
')II obtained from rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil would be negligible (Ref. 18). The comment did not present
any information to contradict FDA's analysis and conclusion on this point. 



4. The Potential for Side Effects From Consumption of Genetically Engineered Foods 



One comment asked whether there might be side effects from consumption of genetically engineered foods, and if so,
whether these side effects would be short term or long term. Another comment noted that food plants and humans exhibit
complex and unpredictable behavior and that therefore, the safety of a food substance should be based on thoughtfully
gathered empirical evidence. 

The comments did not point to any specific side effects of genetically engineered foods. FDA has evaluated the safety
of APH(3
')II and has determined that it is safe for its proposed use. This safety assessment is in fact based on empirical
evidence, such as the structure and function of APH(3
')II, the low level at which APH(3
')II occurs in foods, the digestibility of APH(3
')II, and the inability of APH(3
')II to interfere with clinically useful antibiotics under usual conditions of use for the antibiotics. 



5. Relevance of Clinical Studies 



Several comments noted that a National Institutes of Health (NIH) gene therapy trial in which cancer patients were
infused with cells containing the 

kan

r

 gene, and which was cited by Calgene as strong evidence for the safety of the 

kan

r

 gene, provides little information concerning the safety of the 

kan

r

 gene and APH(3
')II in food. One comment also noted that the combination of data from the in vitro studies and the gene therapy
study was an inadequate basis for a safety determination of the 

kan

r

 gene and APH(3
')II in food that millions of people might eat. 

In determining that APH(3
')II is safe for its proposed food additive use, FDA did not rely on the NIH gene therapy trial. However, FDA does
believe that the in vitro degradation data provide important information that should be and was considered by the
agency as part of its overall safety assessment of the 

kan

r

 gene and APH(3
')II, as discussed earlier in this document. 



C. Possible Effect on Clinical Efficacy of Orally Administered Kanamycin or Neomycin 



Several comments questioned whether the presence of APH(3
')II in tomatoes or other foods might compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or
neomycin. One comment noted that Calgene claimed that at most only 76,800 people annually were administered kanamycin
or neomycin orally, and argued that those people deserved not to be put at risk. The comment further requested that
Calgene be required to perform animal studies on the effects of ingestion of APH(3
')II on the efficacy of orally administered kanamycin and neomycin. The comment asserted that if APH(3
')II were shown to compromise clinical efficacy of kanamycin or neomycin, food containing APH(3
')II should be appropriately labeled. 

Other comments observed that ingested APH(3
')II would not impair the efficacy of orally administered kanamycin and neomycin, that these antibiotics
are rarely administered orally, and that the 

kan

r

 gene is therefore a good choice as a selectable marker gene. 

FDA agrees with Calgene that kanamycin and neomycin are rarely administered orally. The primary clinical role for
orally administered neomycin, and to a lesser extent kanamycin, is cleansing the bowel of microbes prior to bowel
surgery. This use is relatively minor because of severe side effects (auditory nerve damage and kidney damage) that
may result from the antibiotic that is absorbed from the GI tract (Ref. 38). 

As discussed above, for most individuals receiving oral kanamycin or neomycin, APH(3
')II will be inactivated by the acidic environment of the stomach and degraded by the digestive enzymes present
in the GI tract. More important, even for patients receiving simultaneous treatment to reduce stomach acidity, the
amount of ATP available from food would allow, at most, only a small fraction of kanamycin or neomycin to be inactivated.
The comment advocating animal studies did not contradict directly or indirectly FDA's analysis concerning the inactivation
and degradation of APH(3
')II or the information concerning ATP levels. FDA has therefore determined that the presence of APH(3
')II in food will not compromise therapy with orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. On this basis, FDA
has concluded that neither animal studies on the effects of ingestion of APH(3
')II on the efficacy of the antibiotics, nor special labeling of foods containing APH(3
')II for patients receiving orally administered kanamycin or neomycin, are necessary.

D. Fate of the 

kan

r

 Gene in the Environment 



1. Potential Transfer of the 

kan

r

 Gene From Crops to Microorganisms 



One comment posited a connection between ``the prophylactic use of antibiotics [resulting] in antibiotic-resistant
bacteria reaching the human population'' with a health risk from the possible addition of up to ``10 antibiotic genes
[sic] in most of the cells of major crops.'' The comment agreed with Calgene's documentation that the widespread use
of antibiotics has led to an increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment, but went on to postulate
that this was evidence that introducing antibiotic-resistance genes into plants has human health implications.


The comment further asserted that the ``scientific question is whether the resistance genes in the crops can be transferred
by any mechanism [to] organisms that might be human pathogens,'' and that the company should be required experimentally
to ``determine the rates of gene transfer to soil bacteria from plant debris, the persistence or selection of organisms
containing such genes in soil ecosystems, and other important factors in the assessment of the likelihood of releases
compromising the use of antibiotics.'' The comment noted that Calgene analyzed these issues ``in some detail,''
but with ``arm chair calculations, most based on extrapolations from experiments done with other organisms under
other circumstances.'' 

A second comment noted that Calgene had supplied information that three kinds of bacteria, with and without plasmids

7

 carrying antibiotic resistance genes, had little effect on several measures of soil ecosystems, but wrote that the
``relevance of experiments on bacteria to releases of plants is marginal, at best.'' A third comment asserted, without
any supporting evidence, that ``genetic resistance to antibiotics in these plants could be transferred by plasmids
to microorganisms in the soil and elsewhere in the food chain.'' 





FDA agrees that increasing the number and prevalence of antibiotic-resistant microbes may have serious human health
implications if those microbes are themselves pathogens of humans or domesticated animals, or share the same microenvironment
as such pathogens. FDA considers the relevant scientific question to be whether there would be a meaningful increase
in antibiotic-resistant pathogenic microbes in the human environment due to transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene from plants to microbes. This issue was also the subject of considerable discussion at the April 1994 Food Advisory
Committee meeting. As discussed in detail above, FDA has determined, based on the body of evidence presented by Calgene
and based on the discussions of the Food Advisory Committee (Ref. 1), that the transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene from plants to microbes will not occur at a detectable frequency and overall will result in no significant increase
in the numbers of antibiotic-resistant microbes. Regarding whether Calgene should be required to determine experimentally
the rate of transfer, the agency notes that Calgene's calculations represent worst-case scenarios, and the agency
believes it would not be useful to do experiments to attempt to measure that which is too small to measure. 

Regarding the relevance of experiments on bacterial releases to the environment, FDA finds that information concerning
the lack of an environmental effect from the release of microbes with and without antibiotic resistance genes is of
limited direct relevance to the environmental effects of plants with antibiotic resistance genes. The agency did
not rely on this information in reaching its determination that there will be no significant increase in the antibiotic-resistant
microorganism population of the soil. 

Finally the claim that the 

kan

r

 gene could be transferred from plants to bacteria by plasmids is without basis because there is no evidence that plasmids
exist in plants. 



2. Potential Transfer of the 

kan

r

 Gene to Other Crops and to Wild Relatives 



Comments were also received on the potential transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene to other crops and wild relatives. These comments address environmental issues and do not bear on the safety of
APH(3
')II for its proposed food additive use and are therefore addressed in section VII. of this document.

E. Possible Effects of Consumption of Animal Feeds Containing APH(3
')II on Animals and Their Gut Microflora 


One comment argued that empirical evidence should be gathered to assess the potential effects of modified foods on
animals and their gut microflora. 
The agency is aware of no information that APH(3
')II would affect animals or their gut microflora any differently than any other protein in the diet, nor did
the comment provide such information. The comment may have been referring to the theoretical potential for APH(3
')II in animal feed to affect efficacy of neomycin administered to animals, and the theoretical potential
for the gut microflora to take up the 

kan



r

 gene and become resistant to neomycin. As discussed above, the likelihood of transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene to gut microflora of food animals is extremely remote. Also, as discussed above, FDA has evaluated the study presented
by Calgene addressing the possibility of inactivation of neomycin by APH(3
')II in animal feed and has concluded that the therapeutic efficacy of neomycin in animals would not be affected
by consumption of feed containing transgenic cottonseed and rapeseed modified through the use of the 

kan



r

 gene. 



F. Labeling of Foods Containing the Kan

r

 Gene and APH(3
')II 




One comment asserted that APH(3
')II should be labeled as an ingredient. The comment further stated that, if FDA exempted APH(3
')II from ingredient labeling requirements (based on its classification as a processing aid that is present
at insignificant levels in a finished food and has no technical or functional effect in that food), FDA should require
special labeling if the ingestion of food containing APH(3
')II could compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. 
FDA's authority over food labeling is based on section 403 of the act (21 U.S.C. 343). Section 403(i) of the act requires
that, in the case of foods fabricated from two or more ingredients, a food product bear on the label the common or usual
name of each ingredient, unless compliance with the requirement for labeling is impracticable or results in deception
or unfair competition. FDA considers an ``ingredient'' to be a substance used to fabricate (i.e., manufacture or
produce) a food. FDA does not consider those substances that are inherent components of food to be ingredients that
must be disclosed in the food's label. 
A genetic substance introduced into a plant by breeding becomes an inherent part of the plant as well as of all foods
derived from the plant. Consistent with FDA's general 
approach on ingredient labeling, the agency has not treated 
as an ingredient a new constituent of a plant introduced by 
breeding, regardless of the method used to develop the new plant variety. The comment provides no basis for FDA to deviate
from its current practice in the case of APH(3
')II.

8

 Accordingly, FDA has determined that neither the 

kan



r

 gene nor APH(3
')II is an ingredient that, under section 403(i) of the act, must be individually identified in labels of foods
containing them. 




FDA has also determined that the presence of APH(3
')II is not a material fact that must be disclosed in the labeling of foods that contain the enzyme. Under section
403(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)), a food is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading. Under section
201(n) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)), labeling is misleading if it fails to reveal all facts that are ``* * *
material with respect to consequences which may result from the use of the article * * *.'' As discussed
at length above, FDA has determined that the ingestion of food containing APH(3
')II will not compromise the clinical efficacy of orally administered kanamycin or neomycin. Because the
consequences alleged in the comment_compromise of clinical efficacy_will not occur, the presence of APH(3
')II is not a material fact requiring disclosure. 


V. Conclusions 


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of APH(3
')II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton is safe, and
that 21 CFR parts 173 and 573 should be amended as set forth below. 


VI. Inspection of Documents 


In accordance with   171.1(h) and 571.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h) and 571.1(h)), the petition and the documents
that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection
at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above.
As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h) and 571.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available
for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection.

VII. Environmental Impact 



Calgene's initial submission requesting an advisory opinion regarding whether the 

kan



r

 gene may be used in the production of genetically engineered tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants included an environmental
assessment (EA). The agency received comments on this EA. As noted earlier, the request for advisory opinion was later
converted to a food additive petition at Calgene's request at which time Calgene submitted an updated EA. At the time
the notice of filing was published in the 

Federal Register

, FDA announced that the petitioner's EA was being made available to the public at the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) and expressly solicited comments on the EA. No additional comments were received in response to this request
for comments. The comments received on the original EA are discussed below. 
One comment asserted that the 

kan



r

 gene could spread from tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants to other crops and related weeds by pollen flow when
the 

kan



r

 gene-containing crops are grown near nontransgenic crops, and in locations where the 

kan



r

-gene containing crops have wild relatives. The comment noted that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene would create a problem if it were to make wild and weedy relatives more difficult to control. 
The comment also criticized the Calgene submission for not addressing whether it is ``wise to contribute foreign
genes to the gene pools of wild plants even where the plants do not become weeds or manifest other obviously harmful
traits'' and stated that Calgene's submission ``too easily dismissed the problem of 
outcrossing from the engineered oilseed rape.'' The comment noted that oilseed rape has wild and weedy relatives
with which it can breed, and that ``it is not sufficient to rely on traditional commercial control practices to control
gene flow,'' but that the rate of gene flow must be experimentally determined and then ``controlled by procedures
that are demonstrated, not assumed, to work.'' 
The agency has considered the potential for adverse environmental effects from the commercial use of cotton, tomato,
and oilseed rape plants modified to contain the 

kan



r

 gene. The agency notes that it is possible for cotton and tomato plants to transfer the 

kan



r

 gene to neighboring plants of the same species via cross-pollination, although commercially grown cotton and tomatoes
are primarily self-pollinating. Oilseed rape plants are also capable of pollinating sexually compatible wild relatives,
although not all crosses with wild relatives prove fertile. Importantly, however, introduction of the 

kan



r

 gene will not confer a competitive advantage upon a plant receiving it. That is, the gene will not enhance the plant's
capacity to compete with other plants for available resources. In particular, there will be no selective pressure
on plants containing the 

kan



r

 gene because kanamycin will not be present in the environment in sufficient concentrations to create such pressure.
First, there are no specific therapeutic uses of kanamycin that would result in its widespread application to agricultural
crops. Also, kanamycin does not accumulate in the environment from production by soil microbes or by land application
of animal wastes (Ref. 36). Accordingly, FDA has concluded that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene to other crops or related weeds will have no significant adverse environmental effects. 
With regard to the comment about outcrossing from engineered oilseed rape, the comment provided no information to
show that the transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene to wild or weedy relatives of oilseed rape will be any more frequent or have any greater significance than the transfer
of other genes from cultivated oilseed rape. FDA is aware of no human health or environmental concern associated with
such transfer. Therefore, the agency does not agree that the cultivation of 

kan



r

-containing oilseed rape should be subject to control practices any different from those used traditionally. 
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action, including those described
in the comments discussed in this document. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant
impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets
Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

I. Introduction and Background


A. Statutory Authority


Title X of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Sections 1001-1004 of Public Law 102-486, 42 U.S.C. 2296a 

et seq. 

(hereinafter ``the Act'')), enacted on October 24, 1992, requires the Department of Energy (hereinafter the ``Department'')
to reimburse eligible uranium and thorium licensees for certain costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation,
and other remedial action at active uranium or thorium processing sites, which also include vicinity properties.
Consistent with section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-1) the Department is promulgating this final rule to
implement the requirements of Title X and to establish procedures for eligible applicants to submit claims for reimbursement.
Title X provides that, with certain exceptions, remedial action costs at active uranium or thorium processing sites
shall be borne by persons licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2092,
2111) (hereinafter the ``Atomic Energy Act''). Section 1001(b)(1)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(1)(B)) requires
the Department to reimburse eligible licensees of an active processing site a portion of the costs determined by the
Department to be attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and either
(a) Incurred by such licensee not later than December 31, 2002; or (b) placed in escrow not later than December 31, 2002,
and incurred by the licensee in accordance with a plan for subsequent decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation,
and other remedial action approved by the Department.
In order to be reimbursable, such costs must be for work which is necessary to comply with applicable requirements
of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901 

et seq.

) (hereinafter ``UMTRCA'') or, where appropriate, with requirements established by a state pursuant to a discontinuance
agreement under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2021), hereinafter ``Agreement State''. In addition,
claims for reimbursement of costs of remedial action must be supported by reasonable documentation as determined
by the Department.
Section 1001(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)) limits the amount of reimbursement paid to any one licensee
of an active uranium mill tailings site to an amount not to exceed $5.50 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct
material located at the site on October 24, 1992, and generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Total reimbursement,
in the aggregate, for work performed at active uranium sites shall not exceed $270 million. Total reimbursement for
work performed at the active thorium site shall not exceed $40 million, and is limited to costs incurred for offsite
disposal. Under sections 1001(b)(2)(D) and 1003(a) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(D) and 2296a-2(a)),
the $5.50 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement to individual uranium site licensees and aggregate ceilings shall
be subject to annual adjustment for inflation based upon an inflation index chosen by the Department.


B. Background


1. Overview of Uranium Processing Activity Licensed Under the Atomic Energy Act


The U.S. Army's Manhattan Engineer District, from 1942 to 1946, and later the Atomic Energy Commission (hereinafter
``AEC''), from 1947 through 1970, entered into several contracts for the purchase of uranium concentrate to support
the Nation's defense programs. Initially, four mills provided uranium for the Army, primarily through reprocessing
radium and vanadium mill tailings. Eventually a total of 34 commercially operated mills produced uranium concentrate
for sale to the United States Government.
These contracts were for the purchase of an agreed-upon quantity of uranium concentrate. Contract specifications
addressed physical characteristics, grade, and impurities but did not include provisions for mill decommissioning,
long-term management of the milling-process wastes, known as tailings, or stabilization of tailings piles. When
these contracts were executed, the potential hazards of tailings were not fully recognized. Over the ensuing decades,
however, potential radiological and chemical hazards associated with uranium and thorium mill tailings were identified
and standards and requirements were developed for the control and management of tailings.
Between 1975 and 1979, the Department and the Energy Research and Development Administration, successor agencies
to the AEC, completed studies of uranium mill sites that had produced uranium concentrate for the AEC, had subsequently
ceased operations, and were considered inactive. These studies determined that uranium mill tailings located at
these inactive uranium milling sites posed potentially significant health hazards to the public and that a program
should be developed to ensure proper stabilization or disposal of these tailings to prevent or minimize radon diffusion
into the environment and other related hazards.

2. Overview of Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act


As a result of these studies, in November 1978, Congress enacted UMTRCA, which authorizes the Department to undertake
remedial action at ``inactive'' uranium milling sites and at vicinity properties contaminated with residual radioactive
material

1

 generated at a site. Inactive uranium milling sites are those which were no longer licensed under the Atomic Energy
Act on January 1, 1978, and where all or substantially all of the uranium concentrate was produced for the Federal Government.
The Department conducts remedial action in coordination with affected States and Indian tribes under cooperative
agreements at 24 inactive sites.




In addition, UMTRCA established a program authorizing the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (hereinafter
``NRC'') to regulate mill tailings generated during processing operations at ``active'' processing sites (

i.e., 

sites with active licenses under the Atomic Energy Act on or after January 1, 1978) to ensure sound management of tailings
throughout the production, reclamation and disposal phases.


3. Legislative Background


UMTRCA did not provide for payment of costs of remedial action incurred at active uranium processing sites which were
contaminated with uranium mill tailings generated under Federal contract. Two reports prepared subsequently for
Congress, by the Department in January 1979

2

 and by the General Accounting Office in February 1979,

3

 concluded that Federal assistance should be provided to licensees at these sites to address the cost of remediating
mill tailings that were generated under contracts with the United States Government.





Congress directed the Department, through section 213 of Public Law 96-540, to develop a plan for establishing
a cooperative program to provide Federal assistance in the stabilization and management of uranium mill tailings
generated as an incident of sales to the United States Government which are commingled with other tailings. The Department
was directed to identify, among other things, the amount of tailings generated under Federal contract at each active
site. This determination was to be used to calculate the percentage of such tailings in relation to total tailings
at each site, and the corresponding share of Federal assistance appropriate to meet the costs of stabilizing and managing
tailings as required by Federal law.
Title X establishes the authority and framework for providing this Federal assistance. The Department is required
to issue regulations governing reimbursement to licensees at active uranium and thorium processing sites for certain
costs of remedial action. This final rule establishes the requirements and procedures under which the Department
will implement this reimbursement program.

II. Response to Public Comments on the Proposed Rule 


The Department's proposed rule was published on August 9, 1993 (58 FR 42450). A public hearing was held on September
14, 1993 in Denver, Colorado. A total of 16 written comments were received, of which four identical comments were also
presented orally at the public hearing. Most of the comments concerned eligibility for reimbursement, reimbursable
costs, determination of the Federal reimbursement ratio, definition of byproduct material, and claim documentation
requirements. These and all other comments to the proposed rule are discussed below. 


A. Eligibility for Reimbursement 


Subject to certain specific limitations set forth in section 1001(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296(a)(b)), Title X requires
the Department to reimburse licensees of active uranium or thorium processing sites for that portion of remedial
action costs that may be attributed to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Parties
eligible for reimbursement must be, or have been, licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, and must
have incurred costs of ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, or other remedial action'' at an ``active
uranium or thorium processing site,'' as those terms are defined by Title X, sections 1004(3) and 1004(1), respectively
(42 U.S.C. 2296a-3(3) and 2296a-3(1)). A number of comments were received requesting clarification
or revision of the proposed rule's requirements concerning eligibility for reimbursement. 
One commenter requested that the proposed rule's definition of ``licensee'' be changed to specifically include
entities licensed by an Agreement State. Sections 1001(a) and (b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(a) and (b)) require that
the Department reimburse ``persons licensed under section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.'' Both section
62 and section 81 confer licensing authority to AEC and its successor agency, the NRC. 
However, NRC and a state may enter into an agreement pursuant to section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act which provides
for discontinuance of the regulatory authority of the NRC under Chapters 6, 7, and 8, and section 161 of the Atomic Energy
Act when the NRC finds, upon certification by the Governor, that the state's program is in all respects compatible
with the NRC's program for the regulation of byproduct and source material. The discontinuance of NRC authority is
coupled with the Agreement State's issuance of licenses pursuant to a counterpart to section 62 or 81 of the Atomic
Energy Act, under state law. 
If an Agreement State has received authority pursuant to a discontinuance agreement to issue licenses under either
section 62 or section 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, recipients of an Agreement State-issued license, that was in effect
or pending on January 1, 1978, are eligible to apply for reimbursement under Title X. In addition, some active site
licensees have been subject to remedial action requirements established both by NRC and an Agreement State. Accordingly,
the definition of ``licensee'' in the proposed rule has been revised to clarify that a person licensed under the authority
of either section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, by NRC, or under state law by an Agreement State, or both, is eligible
to apply for reimbursement of costs of remedial action. This approach is consistent with, and reflected by, the definition
of ``active uranium or thorium processing site'' in section 1004(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-3(1)), which
specifies that the license for the production of uranium or thorium derived from ore may be issued by NRC, AEC, or by
an Agreement State. 
Several comments were also received concerning the proposed eligibility requirement that a licensee also be a ``site
owner'' of an active processing site. These commenters pointed out that land ownership was not intended by Congress
to be a requirement for reimbursement. One commenter indicated that ownership of the property on which its processing
site is located is divided between private, Federal, and state parties. Other commenters were concerned that the
intent of Title X would be contravened if land ownership was a condition of eligibility for reimbursement. These commenters
suggested that land ownership could also be difficult to define and determine. 
While section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-1) appears to contemplate that applications for reimbursements
will be made by ``a site owner,'' section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A)) specifically refers
to reimbursements paid ``to any licensee,'' and the remainder of Title X is also drafted in terms of payments to licensees.
The term site owner, as used in section 1002 (42 U.S.C. 2296a-1), is not defined nor is there any legislative history
that sheds light on the single reference to ``site owner'' in section 1002. Consistent with apparent Congressional
intent, the Department has interpreted the term ``site owner'' to include any person that currently holds, or held
in the past, any interest in land, including but not limited to a fee simple absolute, surface or subsurface ownership
of mining claims, easements, or a right of access for the purposes of remediation, or any other legal or equitable interest.
The Department has concluded that this definition will encompass all eligible current and former licensees. To avoid
unnecessary confusion, the term ``site owner'' is not used in the rule and the term ``licensee'' is used instead.

B. Costs Eligible for Reimbursement 


Several commenters proposed changes to, or requested clarification of, the language in  765.11(a) of the proposed
rule concerning reimbursable costs and the definition of ``costs of remedial action.'' The proposed rule defined
such costs as those costs incurred by a licensee that were necessary to perform ``decontamination, decommissioning,
reclamation, and other remedial action.'' The phrase ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other
remedial action'' is defined by section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-3(3)), as well as the proposed rule,
as work ``necessary to comply with all applicable requirements of'' UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with requirements
established by an Agreement State. 
Several commenters asked that the definition of ``costs of remedial action'' specifically include a list of cost
categories that are eligible for reimbursement. Furthermore, some commenters suggested that this list should specifically
include the cost of capital, cost of equipment, and interest that might have been earned over the period between the
expenditure and reimbursement; administrative costs; and costs in implementing other environmental program requirements.

In response to these comments, the Department has revised the definition of ``costs of remedial action'' to include
those activities specified in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference that accompanied the
enactment of Title X which states: 



Funds made available under this program are intended to be provided for all costs that result from the disposition
of by-product [sic] material at active processing sites (subject to the limitations of sec. 1001(b)), including
groundwater remediation, treatment of contaminated soil, disposal of process wastes, removal actions, air pollution
studies, mill and equipment decommissioning, site monitoring, administrative expenses, and additional expenditures
required by related standards and regulations.'' (H.R. CONF. REP. NO. 102-1018, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. 392 (1992))



Rather than further attempt to enumerate more precise activities and circumstances for which costs are reimbursable,
the Department has determined that this issue should be resolved on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the statutory
requirements. Section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-3(3)) limits reimbursement to costs for ``work performed
. . . which is necessary to comply'' with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement
State requirements. Therefore, whether work for which reimbursement is sought is necessary to comply with UMTRCA
or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements as required by section 1004(3) of the Act (42
U.S.C. 2296a-3(3)), will depend on specific circumstances that may vary from one site to the next. 
However, in the absence of specific statutory authority, the Department has determined that the carrying cost of
past expenditures or other costs of capital or lost interest are not eligible for reimbursement. Costs incurred for
activities required by other Federal and state regulatory authorities may only be considered reimbursable if the
activity falls within the final rule's definition of ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other
remedial action.'' For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency or a state regulatory authority
may require a licensee to obtain a storm water discharge permit pursuant to the Clean Water Act before the licensee
is able to conduct a remedial action. Therefore, a licensee may be able to demonstrate that the cost in obtaining and
maintaining the a discharge permit is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with Agreement State
requirements. 

Administrative costs and other costs associated with cleanup or restoration of the site may be eligible for reimbursement
provided that a licensee can demonstrate that the costs were necessary to comply with the requirements of UMTRCA or,
where appropriate, with applicable requirements of an Agreement State. 
Several commenters construed the proposed rule to limit costs of remedial action to activities required by an approved
site reclamation plan. These commenters requested that the rule be clarified to provide for reimbursement of other
activities required by other written authorization from NRC or an Agreement State. 
The final rule clarifies that costs for activities required by NRC or an Agreement State and established by a license
condition or other authorization or directive may be eligible for reimbursement. The phrase ``or other written authorization''
is used throughout the final rule to specify that the activity may be authorized by the applicable regulatory authority
by some mechanism other than an approved reclamation plan. 
Several commenters requested that the final rule specify that costs incurred prior to the enactment of UMTRCA are
reimbursable. This request is consistent with section 1001(b)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(1)), which provides
that the Secretary shall reimburse a licensee for costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and
other remedial action which are attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United
States and incurred by the licensee not later than December 31, 2002. Furthermore, section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C.
2296a-3(3)) specifies that the term ``decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial
action'' means work performed that is necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, requirements established
by an Agreement State. 
Therefore, the final rule states that pre-UMTRCA costs may be eligible for reimbursement if the licensee can demonstrate
and obtain the Department's approval that the work was necessary to comply with UMTRCA. A licensee can make this demonstration
by providing a written authorization from the NRC or an Agreement State which indicates that the work performed by
the licensee prior to the enactment of UMTRCA was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable
Agreement State requirements. 

Some commenters objected to  765.11(a) of the proposed rule, concerning the requirement that reimbursable
costs must be for activities ``contributing to final closure.'' These commenters were concerned that the applicable
regulatory authority may revise an approved reclamation plan, license condition, or other directive for the remediation
of the site. Under the proposed rule, a licensee's previously incurred costs of remedial action would not be reimbursable.
The Department acknowledges this concern and has revised the final rule by deleting this requirement. 
In addition, commenters objected to  765.20 of the proposed rule which required licensees to certify that remedial
action work was completed as required by a reclamation plan or other written authorization. These commenters were
concerned that licensees might not be reimbursed prior to completion of remedial actions for individual tasks, as
specified in an approved reclamation plan or other written authorization, upon the licensees completion of these
tasks. The Department agrees with these commenters and notes that it is the Department's intent to reimburse these
costs upon completion of the individual tasks instead of the entire remediation.

Finally, one commenter suggested that  765.2(d) of the proposed rule be modified to clarify that expenses incurred
as a result of an NRC directive, an Agreement State directive, or both, are eligible for reimbursement. A mill may have
been regulated by both the NRC and an Agreement State during the mill's history, and may have therefore incurred costs
for activities required by directives from both regulatory authorities. This commenter urged that references to
``NRC or Agreement State'' be revised to read ``NRC and/or an Agreement State.'' 
The Department has retained the proposed language but wishes to clarify that use of the phrase ``NRC or an Agreement
State'' refers to NRC, an Agreement State, or both. 


C. Determining the Federal Reimbursement Ratio 


The proposed rule provided that the Department would establish a ``Federal reimbursement ratio'' to determine the
portion of costs of remedial action attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United
States. Under the proposed rule, the Federal reimbursement ratio would be the ratio of Federal-related dry short
tons of byproduct material to total dry short tons of byproduct material present at each site on the date of enactment
of Title X. 
Some commenters suggested that the Department should allow licensees to use a method other than the proposed rule's
tonnage or quantity-based approach to establish a site's Federal reimbursement ratio. These commenters argued
that at some sites the tonnage-based Federal reimbursement ratio may not accurately reflect the true costs of remediation
attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States. These commenters also
suggested that the rule allow greater flexibility in the methods available to determine the Federal reimbursement
ratio. In particular, these commenters requested that the rule allow such ratio to be based on the acreage covered
by Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material compared to the total acreage covered by all dry short tons
of byproduct material at the site. 
Title X limits reimbursement to costs ``attributable to'' byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to
the United States, but does not require a specific method for determining how to attribute costs to byproduct material
generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A))
establishes a $5.50 per dry short ton of byproduct material limit on reimbursement. This indicates that the tonnage
approach is an appropriate method for determining the Federal portion of remedial action costs. However, the tonnage
approach may not, in some cases, most accurately reflect the portion of costs attributable to byproduct material
generated as an incident of sales to the United States. As the Department recognized in the ``Commingled Uranium Tailings
Study, Volume II: Technical Report,'' (Department of Energy, June 30, 1982) different approaches for allocating
costs attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States may be appropriate,
depending on the unique characteristics at each site. 
Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to allow a licensee to demonstrate that an alternative method for determining
the Federal reimbursement ratio, other than the tonnage approach, should be used. In order to make this demonstration,
the final rule requires the licensee to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that such alternative method
is more accurate than the tonnage-based approach in delineating between costs of remedial action attributable to
byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and costs attributable to other byproduct
material at the site. Any licensee requesting that the Department consider an alternative approach for establishing
a site's Federal reimbursement ratio, must submit the request in writing, together with any information the licensee
wants the Department to consider in support of the request. The Department reserves the right to approve or reject
the alternative method, based on the Department's determination of whether such method may provide an effective,
accurate, and verifiable means of attributing costs of remedial action for byproduct material generated as an incident
of sales to the United States. Regardless of the methodology used to establish the Federal reimbursement ratio, the
statutory ceiling on reimbursements to licensees will not change. 


D. Definition of Byproduct Material and Dry Short Tons of Byproduct Material; and Determination of Reimbursement
Ceiling at Each Active Uranium Processing Site 


One commenter disagreed with the proposed rule's definition of ``dry short tons of byproduct material.'' This commenter
requested that the definition be expanded to include other wastes as well as tailings. For the reasons stated below,
the Department has not adopted this approach. 
Section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296(a)(b)(2)(A)) requires that the ceiling for uranium mill tailings
sites shall not exceed an amount equal to $5.50 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct material onsite on the
date of Title X's enactment and generated as an incident of sales to the United States. Although Title X incorporates
by reference the Atomic Energy Act's definition of ``byproduct material,''
 the phrase ``dry short ton of byproduct material'' is not defined in either Act. While the definition of ``byproduct
material'' could be read to suggest that the term includes wastes other than tailings, section 1001(b)(2)(A) of the
Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(A)) appears to use the phrase ``uranium mill tailings'' interchangeably in the same sentence
with the phrase ``byproduct material.'' The apparent interchangeable use of these terms is further reflected by
the fact that House Bill 776
, which ultimately was enacted, established a reimbursement limit of $5.50 per ``dry short tons of byproduct 

material

,'' (emphasis added) while the section-by-section analysis of the House Energy and Commerce Report
 accompanying the bill described the limit as ``$5.50 per dry ton for uranium 

tailings

'' (emphasis added). 







Consequently, for the purposes of this rule's maximum reimbursement ceiling determination for active uranium processing
site licensees and Federal reimbursement ratio for uranium and thorium licensees, the Department is defining the
phrase ``dry short ton of byproduct material'' in the final rule to mean ``the quantity of tailings generated from
the extraction and processing of 2,000 pounds of uranium or thorium ore-bearing rock.'' 

One commenter requested that the proposed definition of ``tailings'' be revised to conform to the definition established
by section 101(8) of UMTRCA (42 U.S.C. 7911(8)). The Department agrees with this comment and has revised the definition
accordingly.

The following table establishes the Department's determination as to the quantity of Federal-related dry short
tons of byproduct material and total dry short tons of byproduct material present at each active uranium or thorium
processing site as of October 24, 1992. The data from which these quantities are derived were obtained from the reports
entitled ``Commingled Uranium Mill Tailings Study, Volume II: Technical Report,'' (DOE, June 30, 1982) and ``Integrated
Data Base for 1992: U.S. Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste Inventories, Projections, and Characteristics'' (DOE/RW
0006, Rev. 8). In some cases, this data was updated based on the Department's review of quantity information provided
by some licensees in response to the proposed rule. These quantity reports are available in the Department's Freedom
of Information Reading Room indicated in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. These quantities shall be the basis for the Department's determination of the Federal reimbursement
ratio applicable to each active processing site, unless a licensee requests and the Department agrees to use an alternative
method for computing the ratio. These quantities will also be the basis for the Department's determination of the
individual maximum reimbursement ceiling applicable to each active uranium processing site. 
Although Title X provides that the per dry short ton limit on reimbursement for each eligible uranium licensee shall
not exceed an amount equal to $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, the Department is authorized to establish a lower per
dry short ton limit if necessary. Based on the total quantity of 56.231 million Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct
material, the Department is establishing an initial per dry short ton limit of $4.80. This is necessary because the
aggregate $270 million statutory ceiling will not support the maximum allowable reimbursement of $5.50 per dry short
ton, as established by the Act, if remedial action costs at all of the eligible uranium processing sites reach or approach
this per dry short ton limit (

i.e.

, $270 million divided by 56.231 million Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material equals $4.80 per dry
short ton). The Department will adjust the preliminary limit on reimbursement accordingly when the $270 million
statutory ceiling is adjusted annually for inflation or if other circumstances, as determined by the Department,
enable the adjustment of the preliminary limit.

E. Documentation Requirements


Section 765.20 of the proposed rule required that each claim for reimbursement of costs of remedial action be supported
by adequate documentation. All costs for which reimbursement was sought and all supporting documentation were to
be organized and cross-referenced to specific requirements or activities in an approved reclamation plan. Further,
the proposed rule expressed a preference for documentation that was prepared contemporaneously to the time the costs
were incurred.
A number of commenters questioned the use of the word ``adequate'' to describe the documentation necessary to support
a claim for reimbursement. Section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-1)) requires a licensee to submit a claim
together with ``reasonable'' documentation. In the final rule, the word ``adequate'' has been replaced with ``reasonable''
in  765.20(a) to make the language of the rule consistent with that of Title X.
The proposed rule also generated several comments concerning the amount and type of documentation necessary. Many
commenters contended that the documentation requirements were unduly burdensome. Several commenters recommended
that the Department consider accepting a summary of the available documentation, while reserving the right to audit
the actual documentation at the licensee's facility.
As a result of these comments, the Department has modified the documentation requirements in the final rule to specifically
permit the submission of claims that summarize the supporting documentation, without requiring the submission
of all supporting documentation with the claim itself. Under the final rule, licensees may submit a claim which outlines
all costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is sought and summarizes the documentation available to support
the claim. The Department may audit or may require the licensee to audit, on a case-by-case basis, any documents used
in support of a claim. Under the final rule, licensees are still required to organize and cross-reference summary
documentation supporting a claim to the activity or requirement established in the reclamation plan, or other written
authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs of remedial action, in order to facilitate such an audit. These
documents also must be retained by each licensee until 4 years after final payment of a claim is made by the Department,
access to which must be made available to the Department upon request.
In addition, many commenters indicated that contemporaneous documentation might not be available to support claims.
Various reasons, including the passage of time since costs were incurred, were provided to support the request that
non-contemporaneous documentation be permitted to support the claim for reimbursement.
The proposed rule did not prohibit the use of non-contemporaneous documentation. Instead it established a preference,
but not a requirement, for contemporaneous documentation. The final rule has been clarified to indicate that documentation
prepared contemporaneous to the time the costs were incurred should be used where available. To support a claim for
reimbursement, the most appropriate documentation, but not the only acceptable documentation, is documentation
that was prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred. If contemporaneous documentation is not available,
 765.20(d)(2) provides that non-contemporaneous documentation may be submitted, provided that the documentation
is the only means available to document the costs for which reimbursement is sought. This approach reflects the Department's
understanding that Title X establishes a test of reasonableness regarding the level of documentation necessary
to support a claim for reimbursement. The level of documentation that reasonably can be expected will depend on the
specific circumstances involved in each claim, including the time that has elapsed since the costs were incurred
and the activity for which costs were incurred. The Department intends to evaluate each claim on a case-by-case basis
using this standard of reasonableness.
Some commenters requested that  765.20(e) of the proposed rule be revised to exclude the requirement that the
licensee certify that a quality assurance program was implemented. The Department has determined that this certification
is not required by the Act, but rather is a responsibility of NRC or an Agreement State. Therefore, this requirement
has been deleted from the final rule.
Finally, one commenter encouraged the Department to provide a standardized claims format guide so that guidance
for preparing claims will be available to licensees when the rule is finalized. The Department is preparing guidance
to aid licensees in claim submission procedures. This guide will be distributed to eligible licensees shortly after
publication of the final rule. In addition, the guide will be made available to other interested parties upon written
request to the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, 2155 Louisiana NE.,
suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM 87110, or by visiting the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Reading Room,
1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.

F. NRC or Agreement State Concurrence


Several commenters objected to the provision in  765.21(d) of the proposed rule requiring NRC or Agreement
State concurrence in the reimbursement claim approval process. These commenters asserted that involving the NRC
or Agreement States in the process will cause undue delay. Furthermore, commenters argued that the Department's
review will be adequate because of the Department's experience with UMTRCA Title I sites and because approved reclamation
plans, or other written authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs, will be submitted to support claims for
reimbursement. Some commenters argued that NRC or Agreement State concurrence is unnecessary for those claims that
fall clearly within the scope of an approved plan or license condition. However, another commenter strongly supported
the requirement for written certification from NRC or an Agreement State that claims be substantially in conformance
with NRC or Agreement State authorization.
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, section 1004(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-3(3)) requires that remedial
action costs for which reimbursement is claimed must be for work ``necessary to comply with all applicable requirements''
of UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable requirements established by an Agreement State. Whether work is
necessary to comply with UMTRCA or Agreement State requirements often may be determined, at least in part, by a review
of a site's approved reclamation plan or other written authorization. Licensees are required to link each cost of
remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed to a specific element or activity contained in an approved reclamation
plan or other NRC or Agreement State authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs. This will facilitate the Department's
review of claims, and help to ensure that reimbursement is made only for costs incurred for activities necessary to
comply with UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements.
There may be situations, nevertheless, where the Department's review of the site's reclamation plan or other written
authorization does not confirm that an activity for which reimbursement is claimed was necessary to comply with UMTRCA
or, where appropriate, Agreement State requirements. To address these situations,  765.21(d) of the proposed
rule provided that before approving a claim for reimbursement, the Department would request NRC or the Agreement
State to review the claim and provide written concurrence that the activities for which reimbursement is claimed
are ``substantially in conformance with the licensee's approved reclamation plan.''
In response to the concerns raised by commenters, however, the Department has revised the requirement for NRC or Agreement
State written concurrence. When it is not clear from a comparison of a claim and the approved site reclamation plan
or other written authorization that an activity for which reimbursement is sought was necessary to comply with UMTRCA
or, where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements, the Department will consult with the appropriate
regulatory authority to determine whether the activity was necessary to comply with these requirements.
In addition, some commenters urged that  765.21(c) of the rule explicitly provide licensees with a right to
attend and participate in informal conferences between Department and NRC or Agreement State personnel concerning
a claim for reimbursement. The Department has decided not to adopt this approach. The claim submittal and review process
provide a licensee with ample opportunity to present any relevant information or clarification necessary for the
Department to be fully informed in reviewing and acting upon a claim. In addition, the Department may, at its discretion,
provide a licensee with additional opportunities to clarify any issues which could arise with regard to a claim prior
to reaching a final decision. However, to conform with the above revision to  765.21(d) the Department has deleted
the reference to the informal conference with NRC or an Agreement State in  765.20(c). Any informal conference
would be conducted as part of the Department's consultation with these regulatory agencies pursuant to 765.21(d).


G. Reimbursement of Costs of Subsequent Remedial Action


Section 765.30 of the proposed rule required licensees seeking reimbursement of costs after December 31, 2002 to
submit a subsequent plan for remedial action to the Department in accordance with section 1001(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the
Act. Specifically, reimbursement of costs incurred after December 31, 2002 would be subject to Department's approval
of a plan containing: (1) Applicable remedial action requirements established by NRC or an Agreement State pursuant
to UMTRCA that had not yet been satisfied by the licensee; and (2) the total cost of remedial action required at the site,
with supporting documentation, segregated into actual costs incurred and anticipated future costs.
Several commenters indicated that the proposed rule provided inadequate guidance on the criteria the Department
will use in approving a subsequent plan for remedial action. Specifically, these commenters construed proposed
 765.30(c) to mean that the Department would, if necessary, require a licensee to make changes to a reclamation
plan approved by NRC or an Agreement State. In addition, some of these commenters claimed that the Department's review
should be limited to matters of schedule.

The Department did not intend the proposed rule to require a licensee to make any changes to a reclamation plan approved
by NRC or an Agreement State. On the other hand, the statutory authority to review and approve such plans is by no means
limited to the scheduling of subsequent remedial action. To clarify the scope and purpose of this review,  765.30(c)
has been revised to state that the intended purpose of the Department's review is to determine conformance with an
NRC- or Agreement State-approved reclamation plan, as well as the reasonableness of anticipated future costs. 
Several commenters requested that the Department clarify in  765.30(b) of the proposed rule the time in which
it would approve a subsequent plan for remedial action which was previously rejected by the Department and modified
by a licensee. 
The final rule has been revised to provide that a licensee may continue to resubmit a subsequent plan for remedial action
until the Department approves the plan or September 30, 2002, whichever date is earlier. This deadline for submission
of plans provides sufficient time for a licensee to resubmit such a plan. It also allows the Department sufficient
time to review and approve the plan and to designate by December 31, 2002 available amounts deposited in the Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, an escrow account established at the United States Treasury
Department pursuant to section 1801 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2297(g)), for reimbursement. 
Some of these commenters requested that the Department allow for the reimbursement of remedial action costs incurred
after December 31, 2002 for plans which have been submitted, but not yet approved by the Department, before this date.
The Department does not have statutory authority to reimburse licensees for costs of remedial action after December
31, 2002 for which a plan has not been approved. Therefore, the final rule does not allow for the reimbursement of remedial
costs incurred after December 31, 2002, for those plans which have not been approved by this date. 
One commenter questioned how the Department intends to address costs incurred prior to December 31, 2002, but not
yet approved by the Department at the time the plan is submitted by the licensee. 
To ensure that all incurred and future costs of remedial action are included in a subsequent plan for remedial action,
the Department has revised  765.30(b)(2) to include a third category of costs: Those costs incurred or expected
to be incurred prior to December 31, 2002. This category includes those costs incurred prior to December 31, 2002 but
not yet submitted in a claim for reimbursement, or approved by the Department. 
Finally, many commenters requested that   765.20(e) and 765.30(b)(2) of the proposed rule eliminate
the provision that claims for reimbursement will be reviewed by the Department to assure that the costs are consistent
with the surety requirements provided by the licensees to NRC or an Agreement State. These commenters argued that
there are many significant differences between the anticipated costs upon which the surety requirements are based
and the anticipated costs contained in plans for subsequent remedial action. These commenters also noted that in
some circumstances the surety may not take into consideration all costs that may be reimbursed under Title X. 
The Department acknowledges these concerns and has eliminated the surety requirement in the final rule. To conform
with this change, the Department has deleted the definition of ``surety requirements'' contained in  765.3
of the proposed rule.

H. Actions Subject to Appeals Procedures 


Section 765.22 of the proposed rule provided procedures for appealing the Department's determination concerning
the total dry short tons of byproduct material quantity and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material
quantity present at a site. Although proposed  765.22 provided licensees the opportunity to appeal the Department's
dry short tons of byproduct material quantity determination, several commenters argued that proposed  765.10(b),
which required a licensee to either concur with the Department's determination or waive or exhaust its right of appeal
prior to submitting a claim for reimbursement, effectively forced licensees to forego their right of appeal to obtain
timely reimbursement. These commenters expressed concern that licensees would be unfairly penalized if denied
reimbursement during the potentially lengthy appeals period. 
The Department agrees with these commenters and has eliminated the requirement that a licensee waive its right of
appeal with respect to a quantity determination of dry short tons of byproduct material prior to submitting a claim.
However, in order to define the Federal reimbursement ratio that the Department will use to calculate reimbursement,
the Department must, prior to providing any reimbursement to a licensee, make a determination concerning the total
and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material quantities present at each site on October 24, 1992. Therefore,
although under the final rule a licensee may submit a claim for reimbursement while appealing the Department's dry
short tons of byproduct material quantity determination, the appeal must be made within 45 days after receiving notice
of such determination. The 45-day limit provides a licensee with the right to appeal without foregoing the right to
timely reimbursement and helps ensure that the Department is able to make the determinations necessary for orderly
administration of the reimbursement program. 
Under  765.10(b), the Department's dry short tons of byproduct material quantity determinations will be used
to calculate that portion of an approved claim that will be reimbursed. If the licensee's appeal of the Department's
initial determination is successful, the difference between the initial quantity determination and that established
by the appeals process will be paid to the licensee. 
Some commenters noted that the proposed rule did not provide a licensee an opportunity to appeal the Department's
decision concerning plans for subsequent remedial action, as well as other determinations required by this rule.
This omission in the proposed rule was unintentional. Section 765.22 has been revised and streamlined in the final
rule to allow appeals of any Department determination required by this rule, including a decision to reject or modify
a plan for subsequent remedial action. While the decision to appeal a Department determination associated with this
rule lies in the discretion of each eligible licensee, the rule requires that any appeal comply with the appeals process
specified in  765.22. 


I. Miscellaneous Comments 


Under  765.3 of the proposed rule, the definition of ``offsite disposal'' refers to disposal of byproduct material
from the sole existing thorium mill site pursuant to a plan approved by, or written authorization from, the Illinois
Department of Nuclear Safety or other appropriate state agency. One commenter urged that the specific reference
to the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety be deleted from the definition in the event of a name change or revision
of responsibilities of that agency, and the definition also include approvals and authorizations from the NRC. The
Department has determined that the language of Title X does not limit reimbursement for offsite disposal to activities
required by a specific state regulatory authority. Therefore, the definition of ``offsite disposal'' in the final
rule has been modified to include activities required by the NRC or the State of Illinois. 
Another commenter suggested that the Department consider making partial provisional advance payments to licensees,
subject to an audit of expenditures. The Department does not have the statutory authority to make partial provisional
advance payments. 
A number of commenters suggested that the Department clarify how available funds will be disbursed if there are insufficient
funds for full payment of all claims. Language in the proposed rule did not explicitly specify the priority for disbursement
of funds among claims submitted by different review submission deadlines established by the Department. The final
rule has been revised to specify that, if funds available are insufficient to make full payment in any given review
cycle, all outstanding approved claims will be reimbursed on a prorated basis, regardless of when the claims were
submitted or approved. This approach is consistent with the requirement of Title X that reimbursements be made to
licensees at least annually. 
Commenters also requested that claims be processed and paid twice a year. Title X requires that licensees be reimbursed
at least annually. Therefore, the Department intends to provide payments to the licensees on at least an annual basis,
but the Department is not prepared to commit in the rule to a more frequent reimbursement schedule. 
The Department has modified  765.20(a) and (d) of the proposed rule to clarify that the claim submission deadline(s)
for a given year will be announced in the Federal Register

 shortly after the annual appropriation of funds by the Congress. To ensure an equitable distribution of annual appropriations,
DOE will make payments for approved costs of remedial action from the Fund within one year of the claim submission deadline.

Some commenters also urged the Department to modify the proposed rule's application of the inflation index adjustment
provided in  765.12 for claims approved for reimbursement. Some commenters argued that claims for reimbursement
should be adjusted for inflation from the date the costs were incurred until the date of reimbursement. Others thought
that an inflation adjustment should be made for the period between the submission or approval of a claim and the date
of reimbursement. 
Section 1001(b)(2)(D) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
2296(a)(b)(2)(D)) specifies the authority provided to the Department to adjust certain amounts for inflation.
While the Secretary is given discretion to determine the appropriate inflation index to apply, this section dictates
the amounts that are subject to adjustment for inflation. Congress explicitly and unequivocally limited the application
of the inflation index to ``the amounts in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph [section 1001(b)(2) of
the Act]'' (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(D)). The amounts in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph 1001(b)(2) are
$5.50, $270,000,000, and $40,000,000, respectively. The Department is not authorized to adjust for inflation any
claims for reimbursement. As a result, the approach taken in the proposed rule has been retained in the final rule.

In addition to the revisions discussed above, the Department also made minor clarifying or editorial changes to the
proposed rule which are not specifically discussed in this preamble.

2. Section 765.2 Scope and Applicability 



Section 765.2 describes the general scope and applicability of the rule. In particular, the section provides that
reimbursements shall be made to a licensee of an active uranium or thorium processing site for costs of decontamination,
decommissioning, reclamation, or other remedial action, which are supported by reasonable documentation and determined
by the Department to be attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States.
Costs of decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation, and other remedial action must be for work that is necessary
to comply with the requirements of UMTRCA or, where appropriate, with applicable requirements established by an
Agreement State. Moreover, except as provided by  765.32, reimbursement of a uranium site licensee shall be
limited to $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, per Federal-related dry short ton of byproduct material. The total reimbursement
paid to all uranium licensees shall not exceed $270 million, as adjusted for inflation. Reimbursement of the thorium
site licensee shall not exceed $40 million, as adjusted for inflation. 



3. Section 765.3 Definitions 



Section 765.3 defines the acronyms and key terms used in the rule. Many of the definitions contained in  765.3
are taken verbatim, or with minor changes, from Title X, UMTRCA, or the Atomic Energy Act. Additional definitions,
discussed below, were developed specifically for this rule. 

The term ``active uranium or thorium processing site'' or ``active processing site'' means:

1992. The ratio shall be established by comparing Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material to dry short
tons of total byproduct material present at the site on October 24, 1992, or by another means of attributing costs of
remedial action to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States which the Department
determines is more accurate than a ratio established using dry short tons. 

The term ``Federal-related dry short ton(s) of byproduct material'' is defined as the dry short ton(s) of byproduct
material present at the site on October 24, 1992 that was generated as an incident of sales to the United States.

the requirements of UMTRCA, or where appropriate with applicable Agreement State requirements.


B. Subpart B_Reimbursement Criteria


1. Section 765.10 Eligibility for Reimbursement


Section 765.10 outlines the basic eligibility requirements governing reimbursement. In particular, as required
by section 1001 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a),  765.10 specifies that licensees shall be eligible for reimbursement
of certain costs of remedial action, subject to the procedures and limitations specified in this rule.
Section 765.10(a) of the rule provides that costs of remedial action attributable to byproduct material generated
as an incident of sales to the United States are reimbursable. Section 765.10(b) states that prior to reimbursement,
the Department must determine the number of total dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site on October
24, 1992 and Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. This section provides that these determinations
are subject to the appeals procedures specified in the rule. Provisions are made concerning reimbursement in the
event of an appeal.


2. Section 765.11 Reimbursable Costs


Section 765.11 defines the requirements that a licensee must meet to be reimbursed for costs of remedial action at
its active uranium or thorium processing site. Reimbursable costs of remedial action must be incurred prior to December
31, 2002, or be in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department. These costs of
remedial action shall be reimbursed only if supported by reasonable documentation and approved by the Department
in accordance with this rule. This documentation must demonstrate that the costs of remedial action incurred by a
licensee are necessary to comply with applicable requirements of UMTRCA, or, where appropriate, with requirements
established by an Agreement State. These requirements are contained in a reclamation plan, or other written authorization,
issued or approved by NRC or an Agreement State, for work performed prior to or after enactment of UMTRCA. In addition,
costs of remedial action are reimbursable only if the Department determines that they are attributable to byproduct
material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and present at the site on October 24, 1992. These costs
are equal to the total costs of remedial action at a site multiplied by the Federal reimbursement ratio established
for the site, and approved by the Department for reimbursement.
Section 765.11 limits the amount of reimbursement paid to any one licensee of an active uranium processing site to
an amount not to exceed $5.50, as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons
of byproduct material. Total reimbursement in the aggregate of uranium site licensees is limited to $270 million,
as adjusted for inflation. Reimbursement of costs of remedial action at the eligible thorium processing site may
only be made for costs incurred for offsite disposal, and is limited to $40 million, as adjusted for inflation.


3. Section 765.12 Inflation Index Adjustment Procedures


Title X directs the Department to determine an appropriate inflation index by which to increase annually (1) The $5.50
per dry short ton of byproduct material limit on reimbursement to individual uranium site licensees, (2) the amount
of $270 million authorized for payment to active uranium processing site licensees, (3) the amount of $40 million
authorized for payment to the active thorium processing site licensee, and (4) the aggregate amount of $310 million
authorized for payment to all licensees by Title X. As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the Department intends
to use the Consumer Price Index-Urban (CPI-U) as the appropriate inflation index for these adjustments. Section
765.12 of the rule provides that the   
CPI-U will be used to adjust these amounts annually beginning in 1994, to account for inflation that occurred
in the previous calendar year.


C. Subpart C_Procedures for Filing and Processing Reimbursement Requests


Subpart C establishes the procedures for preparing and processing reimbursement claims. These procedures are designed
to ensure that all information the Department needs to review a claim is made available to the Department, that claims
are evaluated on a consistent basis, and that claims are processed in an efficient and equitable manner.


1. Section 765.20 Reimbursement Request Filing Procedures


Section 765.20 of the rule establishes the filing procedures, content, and format that a licensee must follow when
submitting a claim for reimbursement. Each claim for reimbursement of remedial action costs must be supported by
reasonable documentation.
A copy of the licensee's approved reclamation plan or other written authorization from NRC or an Agreement State must
be submitted with the initial claim. Any revisions to this plan or authorization by NRC or an Agreement State must be
submitted with the next claim prepared following approval of the revision. Each claim must provide a summary of all
costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed. The summary of costs must identify the pre- and post-UMTRCA
costs associated with each major activity or requirement established by the site's reclamation plan or other written
authorization.
The claim for reimbursement must also include a summary of the documentation available to support the claim. All summary
documentation used in support of a claim must be cross-referenced to the relevant page and activity of the licensee's
reclamation plan or other written authorization for pre- and post-UMTRCA costs. All documentation used in support
of a claim must be made accessible to the Department, and the documentation should demonstrate that each cost for which
reimbursement is claimed was incurred for a pre- or post-UMTRCA specific activity included in a reclamation plan
or other written authorization, approved by NRC or an Agreement State. Where available, invoices, payroll records,
receipts, and other documents should be used by the licensee to support claims for reimbursement. The rule requires
licensees to utilize documents that were prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost which they support was incurred,
whenever these documents are available. Documents prepared substantially after the cost was incurred will be considered
by the Department in reviewing claims if that documentation is the only means available to document costs for which
reimbursement is sought. The Department may audit, or require a licensee to audit, any documentation used to support
a claim on a case-by-case basis and will exercise its discretion in determining the weight to accord to various supporting
documents.


2. Section 765.21 Processing Reimbursement Requests


Section 765.21 outlines the procedures to be followed by the Department in processing each claim for reimbursement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940523-0-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940523-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Sections 765.21 (a)-(c) provide that the Department will conduct a preliminary review of each claim within
60 days of the claim submittal deadline to determine if additional information is necessary. The Department may audit
documentation used in support of the claim or request additional information or clarification necessary to verify
any information provided by the licensee in a claim for reimbursement. In addition, the Department may request an
informal conference with the applicant and, if necessary, with NRC or an Agreement State, to obtain information or
clarification concerning any aspect of a claim. While the applicant is not required to provide additional information
or clarification requested by the Department, a failure to do so may result in the denial of that portion of the claim
for which information is requested.
The Department will conduct a final review of all relevant information to make a reimbursement decision. The Department
will notify the claimant of its decision regarding a claim within 10 days of completing the final review.
Sections 765.21 (f)-(g) discuss the timing for processing and for payment of reimbursement requests. Reimbursements
will be made on a prorated basis if there are insufficient funds available to reimburse all claims in full. Amounts
not initially disbursed will be paid on a prorated basis, until satisfied in full, as funds become available. All outstanding,
approved claims will be paid on the same prorated basis, regardless of when the claim was submitted or approved. Payments
will be provided from the Fund, as required by the Act. Payment or obligation of funds shall be subject to the requirements
of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) as specified by  765.21(g) of this rule. Following each annual appropriation
by Congress, the Department will issue a Federal Register notice informing licensees of the availability of funds
for reimbursement and whether the Department anticipates that approved claims for that year may be subject to prorated
payment.
Section 765.21(h) requires an officer or other authorized official of a licensee to certify the accuracy of a claim
for reimbursement, and subjects the individual making the certification to Federal statutes which provide civil
and criminal penalties for making false claims.


3. Section 765.22 Appeals Procedures


Section 765.22 requires a licensee to utilize the Department's administrative appeals process (see 10 CFR part 205,
subpart H) to appeal any Department determination required by this rule, including decisions that: (1) Determine
tailings quantities of dry short tons of byproduct material or the Federal reimbursement ratio; (2) deny, in whole
or in part, any claim for reimbursement; or (3) require modification of or reject a plan for subsequent remedial action.
Any appeal must be filed with the Department's Office of Hearing and Appeals (hereinafter ``OHA'') within 45 days
after the licensee receives notice, actual or constructive, (

i.e.

, by a publication in the 

Federal Register

) of the Department's determination. OHA is a quasi-judicial body that reports to the Secretary of Energy and, except
as otherwise provided by law, is responsible for conducting informal adjudicative proceedings of the Department,
where there is a provision for separation of function. In connection with these duties, OHA holds hearings, receives
evidence, develops a record, and issues a final determination, which is the Department's final decision, subject
to review in the federal courts. A licensee must file an appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies, and
the receipt of an OHA decision is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of any determination made under this Part.


4. Section 765.23 Annual Report


The Department will prepare an annual report, available to the public, summarizing pertinent information from the
preceding year regarding the reimbursement program. The information may include, but not be limited to, individual
and aggregate reimbursement claims approved and paid, approval of plans for subsequent remedial action, completion
of particular elements of remedial action at active sites, total amounts paid and remaining for reimbursement, and
other information. Licensees should be aware that any information submitted in a claim for reimbursement may be subject
to public disclosure, through the annual report as well as by specific request, in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and all other applicable requirements.


Subpart D_Additional Reimbursement Procedures


1. Section 765.30 Reimbursement of Costs Incurred in Accordance with a Plan for Subsequent Remedial Action


Section 765.30 of Subpart D establishes procedures for reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with a plan
for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department.
Reimbursement of costs incurred after December 31, 2002 shall be subject to the submission by the licensee of a plan
for subsequent remedial action and approval of the plan by the Department. Each licensee seeking reimbursement of
costs of remedial action to be incurred after December 31, 2002 shall submit their plan to the Department for its review
and approval at any time between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. The plan must include an estimated total cost
and schedule for remedial action as well as all applicable requirements of remedial action established by NRC or an
Agreement State to be performed after December 31, 2002 at an active uranium or thorium processing site. Each licensee
will be required to provide reasonable documentation or other information to support its estimate of costs to be incurred.
The Department may approve, approve with modification, or reject any plan submitted by a licensee. At any time following
submittal of a plan, the Department may request additional information from the licensee, and may consult with NRC
or an Agreement State concerning remaining remedial action requirements contained in the site's approved reclamation
plan. If the Department rejects a plan, the licensee may file an appeal pursuant to  765.22 or submit revised
plans for review by the Department, until a plan is approved, or until September 30, 2002, whichever occurs first.
The Department has established September 30, 2002, as the deadline for submission of any potential revised plans
so that the Department will have sufficient time to review the submittals and designate available amounts on deposit
in the Fund for reimbursement by December 31, 2002 consistent with section 1001(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C.
2296a(b)(1)(B)(ii)). A failure by a licensee to receive approval from the Department of a plan for subsequent remedial
action prior to December 31, 2002 will preclude that licensee from receiving any reimbursement for costs incurred
after that date. Costs incurred in accordance with the requirements of a plan for subsequent remedial action, and
approved by the Department, will be reimbursed in an amount equal to the approved cost multiplied by the site's Federal
reimbursement ratio, until such time as the Department determines that its obligation under Title X to reimburse
the licensee has been satisfied.


2. Section 765.31 Designation of Funds Available for Subsequent Remedial Action


Section 765.31 establishes procedures for reimbursement of costs incurred in accordance with an approved plan(s)
for subsequent remedial action.

Upon approval of each plan submitted by a licensee, and subject to the availability of appropriated funds and the requirements
of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341), the Department will designate amounts deposited in the Fund at the United
States Department of Treasury, established pursuant to section 1801 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2297g), to
reimburse a licensee for estimated costs of remedial action in implementing a Department-approved plan for subsequent
remedial action. 


3. Section 765.32 Reimbursement of Excess Funds 


Section 1001(b)(2)(E)(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
2296a(b)(2)(B)(i)) authorizes the Department to determine, as of July 31, 2005, whether the aggregate amount authorized
to be appropriated by section 1003 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a-2) when considered with the $5.50 per dry short
ton limit on reimbursement, as adjusted for inflation, for active uranium processing site licensees, exceeds the
amount reimbursable to licensees under section 1001(b)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
2296a(b)(2)). If any active uranium processing site licensee incurs reimbursable costs in excess of $5.50 per dry
short ton limit on reimbursement, and the Department has determined that excess funds exist as of July 31, 2005, section
1001(b)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a(b)(2)(E)(ii)) authorizes the Department to provide reimbursement
of those costs on a prorated basis to the extent funds are available. 
Section 765.32 outlines the procedures that would govern any additional reimbursement. 


IV. Review Under Executive Order 12866 


Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 


V. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that a regulatory flexibility analysis be performed for all rules that are
likely to have ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' This rule involves reimbursement
for costs of remedial action at active uranium and thorium processing sites. The number of potentially eligible applicants
is very limited. Because this rule provides for reimbursement of funds authorized by Title X, it does not pose any adverse
effect on the private sector economy or small entities, and in fact may provide a benefit to small entities located
near active processing sites. The Department, therefore, certifies that this rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 


VI. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) and have been assigned OMB control number 1910-1400. 


VII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 


This rule establishes procedures for the reimbursement of eligible remedial action costs incurred by licensees
at active uranium or thorium processing sites. Implementation of this rule will result in cost reimbursement payments
to eligible licensees, but will not affect the legally required cleanup of the sites or result in any other environmental
impacts. The Department has therefore determined that this rule is covered under the Categorical Exclusion found
at paragraph A6. of Appendix A to subpart D, 10 CFR part 1021, which applies to the establishment of procedural rulemakings
such as procedures for the review and approval of applications for grants and cooperative agreements. Accordingly,
neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. 


VIII. Review Under Executive Order 12612 


This rule does not have a substantial direct effect on the States, the relationship between the States and the Federal
Government, or the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Therefore, no
federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 is required. 


IX. Review Under Executive Order 12778 


Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs agencies to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the rule clearly specifies any preemptive effect, effect on existing
Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings available prior to
judicial review; any provisions for the exhaustion of administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. The Department
certifies that today's rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.

to issue regulations governing the reimbursements. 


765.2 

Scope and applicability. 


(a) This Part establishes policies, criteria, and procedures governing reimbursement of certain costs of remedial
action incurred by licensees at active uranium or thorium processing sites as a result of byproduct material generated
as an incident of sales to the United States. 
(b) Costs of remedial action at active uranium or thorium processing sites are borne by persons licensed under section
62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2092, 2111), either by NRC or an Agreement State pursuant to a counterpart
to section 62 or 81 of the Atomic Energy Act, under State law, subject to the exceptions and limitations specified in
this Part. 
(c) The Department shall, subject to the provisions specified in this part, reimburse a licensee, of an active uranium
or thorium processing site for the portion of the costs of remedial action as are determined by the Department to be
attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States and either incurred by the
licensee not later than December 31, 2002, or incurred by the licensee in accordance with a plan for subsequent remedial
action approved by the Department. 
(d) Costs of remedial action are reimbursable under Title X for decontamination, decommissioning, reclamation,
and other remedial action, provided that claims for reimbursement are supported by reasonable documentation as
specified in Subpart C of this Part. 
(e) Except as authorized by  765.32, the total amount of reimbursement paid to any licensee of an active uranium
processing site shall not exceed $5.50 multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material.
This total amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to section 765.12. 
(f) The total amount of reimbursement paid to all active uranium processing site licensees shall not exceed $270 million.
This total amount shall be adjusted for inflation by applying the CPI-U, as provided by  765.12.

Subpart B_Reimbursement Criteria 



 765.10 

Eligibility for reimbursement. 



(a) Any licensee of an active uranium or thorium processing site that has incurred costs of remedial action for the
site that are attributable to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States shall be eligible
for reimbursement of these costs, subject to the procedures and limitations specified in this Part. 

(b) Prior to reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred by a licensee, the Department shall make a determination
regarding the total quantity of dry short tons of byproduct material, and the quantity of Federal-related dry short
tons of byproduct material present on October 24, 1992 at the licensee's active processing site. A claim for reimbursement
from a site for which a determination is made will be evaluated individually. If a licensee does not concur with the
Department's determination regarding the quantity of dry short tons of byproduct material present at the site, the
licensee may appeal the Department's determination in accordance with  765.22 of this part. The Department's
determination shall be used to determine that portion of an approved claim for reimbursement submitted by the licensee
which shall be reimbursed, unless or until the determination is overturned on appeal. If the outcome of an appeal requires
a change in the Department's initial determination, the Department will adjust any payment previously made to the
licensee to reflect the change. 



 765.11 

Reimbursable costs. 



(a) Costs for which a licensee may be reimbursed must be for remedial action that a licensee demonstrates is attributable
to byproduct material generated as an incident of sales to the United States, as determined by the Department. These
costs are equal to the total costs of remedial action at a site multiplied by the Federal reimbursement ratio established
for the site. These costs must be incurred in the performance of activities, prior to or after enactment of UMTRCA,
and required by a plan, portion thereof, or other written authorization, approved by NRC or by an Agreement State.
Costs of remedial action shall be reimbursable only if approved by the Department in accordance with the provisions
of this part. 

(b) In addition, costs of remedial action incurred by a licensee after December 31, 2002 must be in accordance with
a plan for subsequent remedial action approved by the Department as specified in  765.30. 

(c) Total reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred at an active processing site that are otherwise reimbursable
pursuant to the provisions of this Part shall be limited as follows: 

(1) Reimbursement of costs of remedial action to active uranium processing site licensees shall not exceed $5.50,
as adjusted for inflation, multiplied by the number of Federal-related dry short tons of byproduct material. 

(2) Aggregate reimbursement of costs of remedial action incurred at all active uranium processing sites shall not
exceed $270 million. This aggregate amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to  765.12; and

(3) Reimbursement of costs of remedial action at the active thorium processing site shall be limited to costs incurred
for offsite disposal and shall not exceed $40 million. This amount shall be adjusted for inflation pursuant to  765.12.
(d) Notwithstanding the Title X requirement that byproduct material must be located at an active processing site
on October 24, 1992, byproduct material moved from the Edgemont Mill in Edgemont, South Dakota, to a disposal site
as a result of remedial action, shall be eligible for reimbursement in accordance with all applicable requirements
of this part.


 765.12 

Inflation index adjustment procedures.


(a) The amounts of $5.50 (as specified in  765.2(e) of this rule) $270 million (as specified in  765.2(f)
of this rule), $40 million (as specified in  765.2(g) of this rule) and $310 million (as specified in  765.2(i)
of this rule) shall be adjusted for inflation as provided by this section.
(b) To make adjustments for inflation to the amounts specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department shall
apply the CPI-U to these amounts annually, beginning in 1994, using the CPI-U as published by the Bureau
of Labor Statistics within the Department of Commerce for the preceding calendar year.
(c) The Department shall adjust annually, using the CPI-U as defined in this Part, amounts paid to an active uranium
processing site licensee for purposes of comparison with the $5.50 per dry short ton limit on reimbursement as adjusted
for inflation.


Subpart C_Procedures for Submitting and Processing Reimbursement Claims


 765.20 

Procedures for submitting reimbursement claims.


(a) All costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed must be supported by reasonable documentation
as specified in this subpart. The Department reserves the right to deny any claim for reimbursement, in whole or in
part, that is not submitted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.
(b) The licensee shall provide a copy of the approved site reclamation plan or other written authorization from NRC
or an Agreement State upon which claims for reimbursement are based, with the initial claim submitted. Any revision
or modification made to the plan or other written authorization, which is approved by NRC or an Agreement State, shall
be included by the licensee in the next claim submitted to the Department following that revision or modification.
This reclamation plan or other written authorization, as modified or revised, shall serve as the basis for the Department's
evaluation of all claims for reimbursement submitted by a licensee.
(c) Each submitted claim shall provide a summary of all costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is claimed.
This summary shall identify the costs of remedial action associated with each major activity or requirement established
by the site's reclamation plan or other written authorization. In addition, each claim shall provide a summary of
the documentation relied upon by the licensee in support of each cost category for which reimbursement is claimed.
(d) Documentation used to support a reimbursement claim must demonstrate that the costs of remedial action for which
reimbursement is claimed were incurred specifically for activities specified in the site's reclamation plan, or
otherwise authorized by NRC or an Agreement State. Summary documentation used in support of a claim must be cross-referenced
to the relevant page and activity of the licensee's reclamation plan, or other written authorization approved by
NRC or an Agreement State.
(1) Documentation prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred should be used when available. The documentation
should identify the date or time period for which the cost was incurred, the activity for which the cost was incurred,
and the reclamation plan provision or other written authorization to which the cost relates. Where available, each
claim should be supported by receipts, invoices, pay records, or other documents that substantiate that each specific
cost for which reimbursement is claimed was incurred for work that was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or applicable
Agreement State requirements.
(2) Documentation not prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred, or not directly related to activities
specified in the reclamation plan or other written authorization, may be used in support of a claim for reimbursement
provided that the licensee determines the documentation is the only means available to document costs for which reimbursement
is sought.
(e) The Department may audit, or require the licensee to audit, any documentation used to support a claim on a case-by-case
basis and may approve, approve in part, or deny reimbursement of any claim in accordance with the requirements of this
part. Documentation relied upon by a licensee in support of a claim for reimbursement shall be made available to the
Department and retained by the licensee until 4 years after final payment of a claim is made by the Department.

(f) Each licensee should utilize generally accepted accounting principles consistently throughout the claim.
These accounting principles, underlying assumptions, and any other information necessary for the Department to
evaluate the claim shall be set forth in each claim.
(g) Following each annual appropriation by Congress, the Department will issue a Federal Register Notice announcing:



(1) A claim submission deadline for that fiscal year;
(2) Availability of funds for reimbursement of costs of remedial action;
(3) Whether the Department anticipates that approved claims for that fiscal year may be subject to prorated payment;
(4) Any changes in the Federal reimbursement ratio or maximum reimbursement ceiling for any active uranium or thorium
processing site;
(5) Any revision in the per dry short ton limit on reimbursement for all active uranium processing sites; and
(6) Any other relevant information.



(h) A licensee shall certify, with respect to any claim submitted by it for reimbursement, that the work was completed
as described in an approved reclamation plan or other authorization. In addition, the licensee shall certify that
all costs for which reimbursement is claimed, all documentation relied upon in support of its costs, and all statements
or representations made in the claim are complete, accurate, and true. The certification shall be signed by an officer
or other official of the licensee with knowledge of the contents of the claim and authority to represent the licensee
in making the certification. Any knowingly false or frivolous statements or representations may subject the individual
to penalties under the False Claims Act, sections 3729 through 3731 of title 31 United States Code, or any other applicable
statutory authority; and criminal penalties under sections 286, 287, 1001 and 1002 of title 18, United States Code,
or any other applicable statutory authority.
(i) All claims for reimbursement submitted to the Department shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested. The Department reserves all rights under applicable law to recover any funds paid to licensees
which an audit finds to not meet the requirements of this part.


 765.21 

Procedures for processing reimbursement claims.


(a) The Department will conduct a preliminary review of each claim within 60 days after the claim submission deadline
announced in the 

Federal Register

 Notice specified in  765.20(g) to determine the completeness of each claim. Payments from the Fund to active
uranium or thorium processing site licensees for approved costs of remedial action will be made simultaneously by
the Department within 1 year of the claim submission deadline.
(b) After completing the preliminary review specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Department may audit,
or require the licensee to audit, any documentation used in support of such claim, request the licensee to provide
additional information, or request the licensee to provide other clarification determined by the Department to
be necessary to complete its evaluation of the claim. In addition, the Department reserves the right to conduct an
inspection of the site to verify any information provided by the licensee in a claim for reimbursement, or in support
thereof. Any information requested by the Department, if provided, must be submitted by the claimant within 60 days
of receipt of the request unless the Department specifies in writing that additional time is provided.
(c) At any time during the review of a claim, the Department may request an informal conference with a licensee to obtain
further information or clarification on any unresolved issue pertaining to the claim. While the licensee is not required
to provide additional clarification requested by the Department, a failure to do so may result in the denial of that
portion of the claim for which information is requested.
(d) Based upon the claim submitted and any additional information received by the Department, including any audit
or site inspection if conducted, the Department shall complete a final review of all relevant information prior to
making a reimbursement decision. When the Department determines it is not clear that an activity for which reimbursement
is claimed was necessary to comply with UMTRCA or where appropriate, with applicable Agreement State requirements,
the Department may consult with the appropriate regulatory authorities.
(e) A written decision regarding the Department's determination to approve, approve in part, or deny a claim will
be provided to the licensee within 10 days of completion of the final review.
(f) If the Department determines that insufficient funds are available at any time to provide for complete payment
of all outstanding approved claims, reimbursements of approved claims will be made on a prorated basis. A prorated
payment of all outstanding approved claims for reimbursement, or any unpaid portion thereof, shall be made on the
basis of the total amount of all outstanding approved claims, regardless of when the claims were submitted or approved.

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section, or any other provisions of this part, any requirement
for the payment or obligation of funds by the Department established by this part shall be subject to the availability
of appropriated funds, and no provision herein shall be interpreted to require obligation or payment of funds in violation
of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341). 


 765.22 

Appeals procedures. 


(a) Any appeal by a licensee of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part, shall invoke
the appeals process specified in paragraph (b) of this section. 
(b) A licensee shall file an appeal of any Department determination subject to the requirements of this part with the
Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.
Any appeal must be filed within 45 days from the date the licensee received notice, actual or constructive (i.e., publication
in the 

Federal Register

), of the Department's determination. Appeals will be governed by, and must comply in full with, the procedures set
forth in 10 CFR part 205, subpart H. The decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final decision of
the Department. A licensee must file an appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies, and the receipt of
an appellate decision is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of any determination made unde
