<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the time period for filing written briefs on a proposed marketing agreement and order for
tart cherries grown in the States of Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin is
reopened.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior documents in this proceeding: Notice of Hearing issued on November 23, 1993, and published in the November 30,
1993, issue of the 


Federal Register

 (58 FR 63108); Notice of Additional Hearings on the Proposed Agreement and Order issued on December 20, 1993, and published
in the December 23, 1993, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68065); and an Amendment to the Notice of Hearing issued on January 25, 1994, and published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4259) on January 31, 1994. 



Public hearing sessions were held in late 1993 and early 1994 to receive evidence on a proposed marketing agreement
and order for tart cherries grown in the States of Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Utah, Washington and
Wisconsin. The Notice of Hearing on the proposed marketing agreement and order was issued pursuant to the provisions
of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to
as the ``Act.'' The deadline for filing post-hearing briefs with the Hearing Clerk on the evidence received at the
public hearing was April 29, 1994. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has received four requests from interested parties to provide more time
for interested persons to analyze the hearing transcripts and prepare and file with the Hearing Clerk their written
briefs. These requesters cite hostile weather in their respective growing areas, combined with heavy field activity
and the voluminous hearing record as the reasons for requesting a 60-day extension for filing post-hearing briefs
to June 30, 1994. 

USDA received another request in opposition to any extension of the briefing period. The requester, on behalf of the
Cherry Marketing Institute (CMI), stated that opponents to the proposed agreement and order have had adequate time
to complete their post-hearing briefs. 

Reopening the period in which written briefs may be filed will provide interested persons more time to review the hearing
transcripts and submit written briefs thereto. Extending the briefing period by 30-days to May 31, 1994, would provide
additional time to Oregon, Washington and other commenters, to fairly address their concerns. A delay of 30 days should
not substantially add to the time required to complete this proceeding, in response to the concerns of the CMI. Accordingly,
the period in which to file written briefs is reopened until May 31, 1994. 
This notice is issued pursuant to the Act and the applicable rules of practice governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).

Milk in the Southern Michigan Marketing Area; Partial Decision on Proposed Amendments to Marketing Agreement and
to Order 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This partial decision adopts on an expedited basis a change in the pooling provisions of the Southern Michigan Federal
milk order. The change provides that a distributing plant located in the marketing area that processes and distributes
primarily aseptically processed fluid milk products would be fully regulated under the order irrespective of the
market or markets in which the products may be distributed. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendment
will lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and will promote orderly marketing of milk
by producers and regulated handlers. 
The proposed amendment to the rules has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action
is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendment will not preempt any state or local
laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law
and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for
a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or is the handler's principal place
of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity
is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Prior documents in this proceeding: 
Notice of Hearing: Issued December 3, 1992; published December 10, 1992 (57 FR 58418). 
Supplemental Notice of Hearing: Issued January 19, 1993; published January 29, 1993 (58 FR 6447). 
Recommended Decision: Issued November 29, 1993; published December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64176). 
Notice of Reopened Hearing: Issued February 18, 1994; published February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8874). 


Preliminary Statement 


A public hearing was held upon proposed amendments to the marketing agreement and the order regulating the handling
of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing area. The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part
900), in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on March 1, 1994, pursuant to notice issued February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8874). 
Interested parties were given until March 25, 1994, to file post-hearing briefs on proposal No. 3 as published in the
hearing notice, and on whether the proposal should be considered on an expedited basis. 
The hearing notice specifically invited interested persons to present evidence concerning the probable regulatory
and informational impact of the proposal on small businesses. However, no participants at the hearing testified
about any potentially adverse impacts of the proposal on small businesses. 
The material issues on the record of hearing are: 
1. Modification of the recommended multiple component pricing decision to compute the same protein price for both
handlers and producers on the basis of a cheese market price and a cheese yield formula, and to include any residual
value in the skim milk delivered by producers in the computation of the weighted average differential value. 
2. Amending the pool supply plant shipping requirement provisions to allow the market administrator to adjust the
shipping percentages as market conditions require.

3. Including in the pool distributing plant definition a description of a plant located within the marketing area
which processes at least 50 percent of its fluid milk receipts as ultra-high temperature fluid milk products for distribution
in aseptic packages. A plant qualifying as a pool distributing plant under the new provision would be a pool plant under
the Southern Michigan order regardless of its route disposition in the marketing area of any other Federal milk order.

4. Determining whether an emergency exists to warrant the omission of a recommended decision and the opportunity
to file written exceptions thereto with respect to issue No. 3. 
This decision deals only with issues 3 and 4. The remaining issues of the original and reopened hearings will be considered
in a later decision on this record. Issues 3 and 4 were not considered at the initial February 1993 hearing. 


Findings and Conclusions 


The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the
record thereof: 
3. Include in the pool distributing plant definition a description of a plant located within the marketing area which
processes at least 50 percent of its fluid milk receipts as ultra-high temperature fluid milk products for distribution
in aseptic packages. The provisions of the order that relate to the basis for pooling a fluid milk plant should be modified
to include a distributing plant located in the marketing area if the principal activity of the plant is the processing
and distribution of aseptically processed fluid milk products. Such pool status, however, should not be dependent
upon the amount of route disposition in the Southern Michigan marketing area. 
The order currently provides that to qualify as a pool plant during a given month, a distributing plant must have total
route disposition of not less than 50 percent of the combined Grade A milk received in bulk at that plant direct from
producers, supply plants, cooperative associations, or diverted by the plant operator or cooperative. A distributing
plant may also be considered a pool plant in a given month if it qualified as a pool plant under the same performance requirements
in either of the immediately preceding two months. A distributing plant which also meets the pooling requirements
of another marketing area is regulated under the order in which it has a greater proportion of its route disposition.

Parmalat White Knight Packaging Corporation (White Knight), a proprietary handler, proposed that the order be amended
to accommodate the operations of its milk plant located at Wyoming, Michigan. The plant is located within the defined
marketing area. A witness for White Knight testified that the plant processes, packages, and distributes fluid milk
products that are processed at ultra high temperatures and packaged in aseptic containers. The witness indicated
that the aseptic process includes the use of ultra high temperature pasteurization, and that the resulting products,
commonly referred to as ``UHT'' milk, could be stored unrefrigerated.
 The proprietary handler proposed that this type of plant be a pool plant if it is located in the Southern Michigan marketing
area and meets the current performance requirements for a distributing plant, except for the requirement that the
plant is regulated where the greatest proportion of its route disposition occurs. The proponent stated that the intent
of the proposal is to pool its plant under the Southern Michigan order, irrespective of the level of route sales in this
or other markets. 





The White Knight spokesman cited several reasons why the proposal should be adopted. One reason cited was the nature
of UHT milk products. According to the witness, fluid milk products processed at ultra high temperatures and packaged
in aseptic containers can be stored at room temperature for nine months, in contrast to typical fluid milk products,
which must be refrigerated and have relatively short shelf lives. As a result, when compared to the regularly-scheduled
and relatively local distribution of fluid milk products, White Knight has the ability to distribute its products
at more infrequent intervals and over a much broader geographical territory. White Knight's milk supply is procured
from two cooperatives which represent 80 percent of producer milk in the order. Because of the typical procurement
but unique distribution patterns, the proponent asserted, the current pooling provisions create a disincentive
against local producers supplying a local Class I plant. 
The nature of the proponent's dairy products has led to chaotic marketing conditions, the witness stated. Due to the
distribution and sales patterns of its aseptically-packaged products, the regulatory status of the UHT plant has
shifted from order to order, even on a monthly basis. The witness noted that in the five months beginning in September
1993, the plant was pooled under four different federal orders: Carolina, New Orleans-Mississippi, Southeastern
Florida, and Tampa Bay. In a recent month, proponent's products were sold in 17 federal order marketing areas, in addition
to unregulated territory. Almost half of the proponent's sales were in unregulated areas. 
The witness stated that continual change in regulation under different federal orders puts the proponent at a competitive
disadvantage to handlers who know with certainty under which order they will be regulated, because advance knowledge
of the Class I price virtually is eliminated for the proponent. This has made it difficult for the proponent to price
and sell its products because its costs are not known in advance.

The witness noted that the administrative costs of tracking distribution and sales patterns are greater with the
regulatory shifts. Additional administrative effort and time on the part of the market administrator, the proprietary
handler, and the cooperative supplier is necessary to obtain information detailing where the milk originates and
where the product is sold to consumers. Because of the numerous areas in which the handler markets products, the witness
testified, it is more difficult for the handler to properly report its sales of UHT milk on a monthly basis. Payroll
information requirements are duplicated in both the originating and the pooling orders and are necessary for all
producers' milk that is shipped to the plant during the month. Because the producers whose milk is shipped to the proponent's
plant may vary during the month, more administrative work is created. The variation of reports required under different
orders also requires additional time each month. The process would be simplified for the market administrator, handler,
and cooperative if regulation were maintained under only one order.
Moreover, some markets under which the proponent's plant has been pooled have base-excess plans, such as the Carolina
order. According to proponent's post-hearing brief, because the group of producers whose milk is supplied to the
proponent changes somewhat each month, little or no base would be accumulated, even under continuous regulation,
in a market that uses a base-excess plan. Hence, producers supplying the predominantly Class I White Knight plant
would be penalized by receiving the excess or Class III price. The brief continues by noting that failure to earn base
creates a disincentive for producers to supply a Class I plant, which is not the intent of the base-excess provisions
or the Federal Order program.
In proponent's view, failure to adopt its lock-in proposal on an expedited basis would cause continuation of disruptive
market conditions, operational problems for the UHT plant, administrative problems for the various orders, competitive
uncertainty for the proponent, and payment problems for producers.
A witness representing Independent Cooperative Milk Producers Association (ICMPA) and Michigan Milk Producers
Association (MMPA) also testified in support of proposals 3 and 4. The entire milk supply for the White Knight plant
is obtained from ICMPA and MMPA. The witness concurred with the proponent's testimony. He stated that continuing
to sell milk to the plant puts producers whose milk is shipped to White Knight in an inequitable situation with other
order producers, and that various Class I differentials adjusted for location are disruptive to the order. Some milk
destined for White Knight has been reloaded at a plant located within the marketing area to insure that it will be pooled
under the order. The witness testified that reloading is not practical and results in increased costs for the supplying
cooperative and White Knight.
The supplying cooperatives' witness also raised concerns about base-excess possibilities. The witness stated
that by shipping the milk to White Knight, the cooperative is accepting the price that will be received for it. ICMPA,
he testified, does not want to supply a handler and receive less value for the milk than would have been received if the
milk were sold for utilization within the market area. The witness also testified that the potential of being pooled
under a base-excess order, in months when milk in excess of an established base is assigned a lower value, could cause
the supplying cooperative to deny shipments of milk to the distributing plant.
No opposition to the proposal was expressed at the hearing or in briefs.
The record evidence indicates that fluid milk products have been processed at the proponent's plant since September
1993; currently, UHT pasteurization and aseptic packaging are used in the manufacturing of all dairy products. Most
of the plant's milk utilization is classified as Class I, and a small amount of the milk is classified as Class III. White
Knight purchases milk from two cooperatives which represent approximately 80 percent of producer milk in the order.
The proponent's distribution channels for UHT fluid milk are substantially different from those used to distribute
fluid milk products that require refrigeration. These latter products generally are distributed through frequent
deliveries by distributing plants to stores within the marketing area. According to record evidence, the proponent's
products are distributed as far away as the Caribbean and in a substantial number of federal order areas each month.
Under current provisions, a distributing fluid milk plant that qualifies for pooling under more than one order during
the same month is regulated under the order in which such plant's route distribution is the greatest. Such a provision
normally assures that all handlers having their principal sales in a market are subject to the same pricing and other
regulatory requirements. However, because of its products' distribution patterns, the proponent's UHT plant has
yet to be regulated under any one particular order on a regular basis. The problems that have occurred from such pooling
uncertainties are severe enough to override the traditional basis for pooling a distributing plant.

Shifting regulatory status of the proponent's plant between orders creates uncertainty, which is not conducive
to maintaining market stability in the Southern Michigan market, and may affect other markets adversely, as well.
For example, the Class I differential at the Wyoming location, $1.70 under the Southern Michigan order, ranges for
the four orders under which the plant has been regulated from $1.175 under the New Orleans-Mississippi order to $1.54
under the Southeastern Florida order, a range of 36.5 cents per hundredweight. Such price changes create serious
marketing problems to the proponent in determining what price to place on the various UHT products. The supplying
cooperatives also experience difficulty in pricing milk to White Knight due to the broad geographic area of the plant's
product distribution, and uncertainty about the level and the basis of returns they receive for their milk if the regulatory
status of the plant is unstable.
Prices received by producers under an order are influenced by the amount of the Class I differential, the market utilization
of milk, the applicable location adjustments, and method of payment. Since these factors vary from order to order,
producer prices at the White Knight UHT plant vary considerably when the plant shifts regulation from one order to
another on the basis of sales shifts. Under these disorderly circumstances, producers would find it disruptive to
their operations and long-range planning to shift from one market to another. When regulated by one order, pay prices
for producers supplying the proponent's plant would be the same as for other producers shipping to plants in the same
zone. In addition, producers whose milk is pooled regularly under the various orders under which White Knight may
become regulated may find their pay prices fluctuating and disrupted.
The record evidence indicates that both the proponent and its milk suppliers are concerned with the possibility that
the plant might be regulated under an order with a base-excess plan during months in which milk in excess of an established
base is assigned a lower value. Without an established milk production base, the milk would be priced at the excess
price.

2

 White Knight would be unable to attract an adequate supply of milk if it were known that the milk would be excess milk
in a marketing area with a base-excess plan. Therefore, the continued milk supply for the UHT plant is threatened unless
current order provisions are amended. Under the circumstances described in the record, consideration must be given
to regulating the plant in the market in which there is reasonable assurance that it will have available an adequate
supply of producer milk.




It is concluded that overall market stability will tend to be maintained and the regulatory stability of the White
Knight UHT plant (or any other such plant) will tend to be assured if the order is modified along the lines proposed.
The order will specify that the principal activity at such a plant must be the processing and distribution of aseptically
processed fluid milk products. Such a requirement is intended to assure that a plant would not be able to be pooled under
the particular pooling provision at issue unless at least one-half of the plant's fluid milk receipts are processed
and distributed in the form of aseptically processed fluid milk products. Thus, the plant would have some operating
flexibility.
Under the lock-in provision adopted herein, the Southern Michigan order would regulate the Wyoming UHT plant (or
any other similar plant) even though it had a greater proportion of its route distribution in the marketing area of
another order. The intent of this pooling arrangement may be in conflict with the pooling requirements of another
order since the other order may not have a complementary provision which will permit the plant to be locked in under
the Southern Michigan order. It is not possible to eliminate pooling conflicts between the provisions of the Southern
Michigan order and other orders by amending only the Southern Michigan order. Thus, whenever such a pooling conflict
arises, an administrative decision as to the order under which the plant shall be pooled may be necessary, depending
upon the particular provisions of each order and the intent of maintaining Southern Michigan regulation for a UHT
plant located within the marketing area.
4. Emergency Action. The omission of a recommended decision was proposed by proponent of the lock-in proposal that
was discussed above as issue 3. The witness representing the supplying cooperatives also stated support for an emergency
decision. No testimony was received in opposition to emergency action. The testimony and data in the record of this
proceeding strongly indicate the need for prompt amendatory action. The evidence shows it is desirable to have an
amended order effective as soon as possible to minimize the disorderly marketing conditions currently facing the
UHT plant. The normal procedure of issuing a recommended decision and providing time to file exceptions thereto would
further the disorderly market conditions that the UHT plant is facing.
It is therefore found that due and timely execution of the Secretary's function in this proceeding imperatively and
unavoidably requires omission of the recommended decision and the opportunity for filing exceptions thereto.


Rulings on Proposed Findings and Conclusions


A brief and proposed findings and conclusions were filed on behalf of White Knight. The brief, proposed findings and
conclusions, and the evidence in the record were considered in making the findings and conclusions set forth above.
No opposition to either the lock-in proposal or to emergency consideration was received in testimony or in proposed
findings and conclusions.


General Findings


The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the Southern Michigan
order was first issued and when it was amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed,

Order Amending the Order Regulating the Handling of Milk in the Southern Michigan Marketing Area



This order shall not become effective unless and until the requirements of  900.14 of the rules of practice and
procedure governing proceedings to formulate marketing agreements and marketing orders have been met.



Findings and Determinations



The findings and determinations hereinafter set forth supplement those that were made when the order was first issued
and when it has been amended. The previous findings and determinations are hereby ratified and confirmed, except
where they may conflict with those set forth herein.

(a) 

Findings. 

A public hearing was held upon certain proposed amendments to the tentative marketing agreement and to the order regulating
the handling of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing area. The hearing was held pursuant to the provisions of the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice
and procedure (7 CFR part 900).

Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at such hearing and the record thereof, it is found that:

(1) The said order as hereby amended, and all of the terms and conditions thereof, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act; 

(2) The parity prices of milk, as determined pursuant to section 2 of the Act, are not reasonable in view of the price
of feeds, available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand for milk
in the aforesaid marketing area; and the minimum prices specified in the order as hereby amended are such prices as
will reflect the aforesaid factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk, and be in the public interest;
and

(3) The said order as hereby amended regulates the handling of milk in the same manner as, and is applicable only to persons
in the respective classes of industrial or commercial activity specified in, a marketing agreement upon which a hearing
has been held.



Order Relative to Handling





It is therefore ordered,

 That on and after the effective date hereof, the handling of milk in the Southern Michigan marketing area shall be in
conformity to and in compliance with the terms and conditions of the order, as amended, and as hereby amended, as follows:

ACTION:

 Petition for rulemaking: Extension of comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 18, 1994 (59 FR 8143), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published for public comment a petition
for rulemaking filed by the U.S. Department of Energy. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations
governing packaging and transportation of radioactive materials to specifically exempt canisters containing
vitrified high-level waste from the double containment requirement specified in NRC's regulations. The comment
period for this petition for rulemaking was to have expired on May 4, 1994. The INEL Oversight Program of the State of
Idaho has requested a thirty-day extension of the comment period. In view of the fact that the State of Idaho has received
technical background documents regarding the proposed amendment only recently from the U.S. Department of Energy
and requests this extension to review these documents and provide comments, the NRC has decided to extend the comment
period for an additional thirty days. The extended comment period now expires on June 3, 1994.

Payment of Excess Expenses Incurred by Purchaser in Connection With the Redemption of Real Property Under I.R.C.
 7425 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains a proposed regulatory amendment relating to the payment of excess expenses incurred by a purchaser
at a nonjudicial sale in connection with redemptions of real property by the United States under Internal Revenue
Code section 7425. The existing regulations provide guidelines for submitting claims for excess expenses incurred
by a purchaser, or his or her successor in interest, after a foreclosure sale and before redemption, but do not provide
a cutoff date for submission of claims for excess expenses. The intent of the proposed regulations is to provide such
a cutoff date. These proposed regulations provide that when requested by the district director, a purchaser at a nonjudicial
foreclosure sale must submit a written claim for excess expenses within 30 days of the request for such claim to be considered.
If, however, the purchaser does not submit a claim at that time, but does incur excess expenses, the purchaser may submit
a claim within 30 days after the redemption. Failure to submit a claim within that time period forecloses the right
to do so. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Background 



This document contains proposed regulations that would amend the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 301) under section
7425 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The regulations would impose a time limit within which a purchaser of real
property at a nonjudicial sale may submit a claim for excess expenses to the United States when it is redeeming such
real property. The United States will not consider any claim made after expiration of the time limits.

Explanation of Provisions 



Treasury Regulation  301.7425-4(b)(3)(ii) does not provide a specific time period within which the
purchaser at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale may submit a claim for excess expenses after the redemption. The proposed
regulations clarify that claims for excess expenses must be submitted within the time periods specified in the regulations
in order for the purchaser to be reimbursed. 

The proposed regulations establish a 30-day limit after a request is made by the district director for the purchaser
at a nonjudicial sale or his or her successor in interest to furnish a written itemized statement of expenses in excess
of income. Since excess expenses could be incurred after a district director's request, a purchaser who fails to submit
a claim at this time may submit a claim within 30 days after the date of redemption. These limits will allow the purchaser
a reasonable amount of time within which to determine the amount of any excess expenses and to submit a claim to the United
States. After the expiration of the relevant time periods, the United States may distribute all surplus proceeds
associated with the sale of the redeemed property unhindered by any possibility of a claim for excess expenses made
in the future when the surplus proceeds of sale are no longer available to satisfy such a claim. Adding time limits will
also expedite the handling of redemption sales by earlier disposition of surplus proceeds of sale. Disputes concerning
properly submitted claims will still be resolved by the United States within a reasonable time after the redemption
period. The Service solicits comments as to whether the 30-day period after the date of redemption for a purchaser
to submit an itemized statement of excess expenses or to submit additional excess expenses is adequate. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 



Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 



Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
that are submitted timely (preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the IRS. All comments will be available
for public inspection and copying. A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely
submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will
be published in the 

Federal Register

. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Robert A. Walker, Office of Assistant Chief Counsel (General Litigation).
However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated in their development. 



List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 301 



Employment taxes, Estate taxes, Excise taxes, Gift taxes, Income taxes, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping
requirements. 



Proposed Amendments to the Regulations 



Accordingly, 26 CFR part 301 is proposed to be amended as follows: 



PART 301_PROCEDURE AND ADMINISTRATION 





Paragraph 1. 

The authority citation for part 301 continues to read in part as follows:

that were not claimed in the original itemized statement, the purchaser or his or her successor in interest may submit
a written itemized statement to the district director within 30 days after the date of redemption. If the purchaser
or his or her successor in interest fails to timely submit such a written itemized statement, no amount shall be payable
for expenses in excess of income.

Presort Accuracy Validation and Evaluation (PAVE) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed program. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) published proposed requirements for a Vendor Presort Software Validation Program
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 14, 1992 (57 FR 12893-12901). After receiving written comments in response to the proposal, the Postal
Service decided to provide additional opportunity for comment. To facilitate the receipt of additional comments,
a public meeting was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32188), and held on August 5, 1992, at the USPS National Customer Support Center. As a result of
comments received, a withdrawal of the proposed rule was subsequently published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 11, 1992 (57 FR 41716), in order to publish the following new proposed rule for a Postal Service testing
and certification program of presort software that it intends to name Presort Accuracy Validation and Evaluation
(PAVE). 



PAVE, if adopted, would be a voluntary program in which the Postal Service would, upon request, provide testing for
certain categories of presort software and hardware products to determine their accuracy in sorting address information
according to the mailing standards of the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM). This program would assure those using presort
software packages that a PAVE-certified product, if used properly, would have the capability of performing its intended
function according to the current mailing standards of the Postal Service. 

Because make-up errors in mail preparation cannot be eliminated via software alone, the use of a PAVE-certified presort
product to produce a mailing would not assure rate eligibility. As part of this program, manufacturers of certified
presort software would need to inform users of their products that proper use of presort software (e.g., selecting
appropriate options for a given sortation, using the correct parameter settings, etc.) would remain critical to
ensuring accurate sortation. 

The Postal Service is seeking comments from interested parties, including developers and users of presort products,
to ensure the most effective design and implementation of this proposed program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Many mailers rely on computer software to generate mailings for postage discounts. Two areas where computer software
has proved particularly advantageous in mail production are the matching and coding of individual address records
and the presorting of address lists. To validate the accuracy of address matching software, the Postal Service has
established the Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS), which provides a common platform to measure the quality of
this software. The Postal Service proposes, with this notice, the implementation of a similar program to validate
the accuracy of presort software products in specific presort categories. This program would be voluntary and available
to all developers of presort products that sort address information according to the presort standards of the DMM.
It would be available to test products configured for personal, mid-range, or main frame computers including mail-sorting
optical character readers. The Postal Service does not propose that the use of PAVE certified software be mandatory
for obtaining presort postage discounts. 



For purposes of PAVE certification, eligible presort product developers are defined as those firms that initially
develop a presort product, regardless of commercial availability. This definition also includes those that make
modifications that alter the sorting logic, documentation generation capability, or add to or revise the original
parameters of a software product. 

A presort product is defined as a complete set of computer program modules or equipment that presorts address lists
or mailpieces according to DMM standards for one or more types of mailings. 



Program Overview 



Developers of presort software and/or hardware would apply for PAVE certification of their products. On receipt
of the application, the Postal Service would forward the appropriate test file of address records to the developer.
The developer would sort the file with its presort product and print documentation supporting accurate sortation
and rate application (along with other documentation printed by the software). This information, along with the
original media, would be returned for evaluation to the USPS National Customer Support Center (NCSC) within a specified
time frame. 

The Postal Service would then evaluate the documentation for presort accuracy. In addition, the Postal Service would
evaluate the accuracy, format, and content of; required postal documentation (where applicable), facsimile mailing
statements (if generated), and any other postal forms generated by the software product in the category being tested.


If the Postal Service determines that the presort product satisfies the current presort standards, the developer
would be issued a PAVE certificate for that product in that category. The certification would be good for 1 year, or
until the next PAVE cycle. PAVE testing would be conducted from August through December, as detailed further in this
notice. A list of PAVE-certified software/hardware developers would then be published in the 

Postal Bulletin

 (or a similar publication/listing as is currently used for CASS/MASS certified vendors). 



Selecting Specific Presort Categories 



The Postal Service would not be able to test individually all presort categories every year. The Postal Service would
choose a limited number of presort categories annually for PAVE testing. Presort product developers would be notified
of the new test categories as well as any changes made to previous tests to be evaluated in the next PAVE cycle approximately
3 months in advance of actual testing, so that developers could prepare for and order the appropriate test files.

<TEXT>
 

Presort categories would be chosen based on, but not limited to, the following criteria: 
 Presort categories most often used by different mailers (to ensure testing of the most commonly used products).

 Presort categories where significant mail preparation error is being detected by the Postal Service. 
 Presort categories that are relatively new. 
For the first PAVE test cycle, the Postal Service proposes the following domestic presort categories: 
 Presorted First-Class. 
 First-/third-class barcoded letter-size:



_Tray-based. 
_2-Tier package-based. 
_3-Tier package-based.



 Second-class presort (carrier route, 3/5 digit, and basic). 
 Third-class presort (3/5 digit and basic). 
 Third-class carrier route presort. 
A presort product developer requesting one or more of the files for PAVE testing would also receive a technical guide
that details specifications for each test category. These specifications would include such information as: 
 Mailpiece specifications (mailpiece thickness, weight, length, and height). 
 Mail processing category. 
 Maximum pieces to a tray (if applicable). 
 Minimum pieces to a tray (if 3/4 full tray is a pertinent criteria). 
 Mail entry point. 
 Sortation levels allowed (if applicable). 
 Overflow trays (if allowed). 
 Total number of records (addresses) contained in the file. 


OCR Testing 


As detailed later, all the test files would be provided to requesting presort product developers in electronic media
(magnetic tape, cartridge, and diskette). However, for optical character reader (OCR) applicants, the Postal Service
would provide the First-/third-class barcoded letter-size test(s) as a physical test deck of actual mailpieces.
The Postal Service proposes that the physical test deck, rather than an electronic file, would better accommodate
the actual sortation process of an optical character reader. 
This physical test deck would be similar to that used in MLOCR Accuracy Support System (MASS) testing, consisting
of several thousand sample mailpieces that would be sent to the applicant's location for OCR presorting. The entire
test deck would be presorted as would a regular mailing in that particular category, trayed, labeled, and documented,
and then returned to the Postal Service for PAVE evaluation. 
Similar to other PAVE participants, eligible OCR participants would consist of those manufacturers that initially
developed the presort software product used in the OCR, regardless of commercial availability, or those that made
modifications that alter the sorting logic, documentation generation capability, or add to or revise the software's
original parameters. 


Test Cycle and Frequency 


The Postal Service proposes the following PAVE test cycle for 1994: 


1. Submitting Applications (August 1-31) 


Software developers would complete and forward order forms for a specific test file(s) to the Postal Service for receipt
no later than August 31. 


2. Distributing of Test Files (September 1-30) 


NCSC would mail the test file(s) to requesters during this period. 


3. Returning Test Files (September 1-October 15) 


Presort product developers would process the test file through the presort product being tested and return the sorted
file, along with hard copy documentation supporting accurate sortation and rate application, for receipt by NCSC
no later than October 15. 


4. Evaluating and Responding (November 15-December 15) 


The Postal Service would examine the hard copy documentation for accuracy and provide evaluation results to the presort
product developer no later than December 15. 


5. Retesting (November 15-December 31) 


Developers would have this period to request, process, and be reevaluated on those test(s) that they had failed in
the initial test cycle. 


6. Publishing PAVE-Certified Developers (January, 1995) 


A list of PAVE-certified presort product developers, product names, version numbers, and presort categories would
be published in the Postal Bulletin (or a similar publication/listing as is currently used for CASS/MASS certified
vendors). 





Note:

 Although the Postal Service proposes the above PAVE cycle to establish reasonable time frames and cut-off dates for
each process, steps 2 through 5 would be expedited where possible.

Application Process 


To apply for PAVE certification, eligible presort product developers would complete the order form shown as Exhibit
A of this notice. Only one form would be necessary regardless of the number of presort categories being applied for.
The completed form would be sent to the following address: 
Pave Certification Program, 
National Customer Support Center, 
United States Postal Service, 
6060 Primacy Pky Ste 101, 
Memphis, TN 38188-0001. 


PAVE Test Files 


PAVE test files would vary in record quantity and ZIP Code variety depending on the presort category being tested.
However, all the address records in the files would consist of randomly selected primary street records appropriate
for the ZIP Code, ZIP+4 code range, or delivery point code numerics used (the correction character numerics would
not be included). This use of error-free addresses would eliminate problems arising from presort products that incorporate
some address verification mechanisms prior to sortation. 
The test files would be configured in the following media: 
 Magnetic Tape: 



_6250 BPI EBCDIC. 
_6250 BPI ASCII. 
_1600 BPI EBCDIC. 
_1600 BPI ASCII. 



 Cartridge: 



_IBM 3480 38K. 



 Diskette: 



_3-1/2
'
', 1.44 Megabyte MS-DOS. 
_5-1/4
'
', 1.2 Megabyte MS-DOS.

 

 Physical Test Deck (for OCR software/hardware developers only) 



_Standard 

#

10 white window envelopes (4-1/8
'
' x 9-1/2
'
') made of 24 pound basis weight paper stock with inserts preprinted with OCR-readable addresses and POSTNET
barcodes. 


Processing Test Files and Providing Documentation 


Once received, the developer would sort the test file(s) at its location with its presort product according to the
presort category being examined. The developer would generate hard copy documentation to support the accurate sortation
and rate application of the addresses on the test file. This would include such information as the following: 
 Documentation required to accompany the mailing statement (if applicable). 
 Tray/package audit trails. 
 Tray, sack, label generation (samples of each type). 
 Summary reports. 
 Parameter reports (parameters used to run the test file). 
In addition, the developer would generate (as an output of this test run) and submit for PAVE evaluation other forms
of documentation available to users of the product, such as: 
 Mailing statement facsimiles (if mailing statement facsimiles are not generated by the software product,
the manufacturer would have to provide rate qualification totals for PAVE certification). 
 Other postal forms facsimiles. 
At previous commenters' requests, the Postal Service considered the possibility of having developers send their
products to the Postal Service for PAVE testing rather than providing test files to be processed at developers' locations.
After initial review, this was felt to be inefficient or inappropriate for the following reasons: 
 Various operating platforms/systems might not be available for the Postal Service to run all the products.

 Postal Service examiners would likely require in-depth training on many products in order to evaluate their
capabilities properly. 
 Tests might become too subjective given examiner's varying knowledge of different products. 
 Security and liability issues might arise given the receipt and usage of presort software programs not otherwise
available to the general public or in advance of their commercial release. 


Evaluating PAVE Tests 


Evaluating a returned test would consist of the Postal Service examining the required hard copy reports returned
by the presort product developer and, for OCR evaluation, the physical test deck. This evaluation would focus primarily
on proper sortation according to DMM standards but would also include an examination of the content and clarity of
supporting documentation (required to accompany mailing statements), the content, format, and clarity of facsimile
postal forms, as well as the accuracy of other computer-generated documentation submitted. To be PAVE-certified,
the examination would have to conclude that the results were in complete accord with the DMM standards that were applicable
at the time of the test. 
In many cases DMM presort standards allow for a range of correct answers to a specific sortation. As an example, the
precise number of pieces to a tray or sack is not mandated by standard. Changing this parameter can create different
mailings from the same address list and yet still satisfy DMM standards. For this reason, no one specific (or optimum)
answer would be mandated under PAVE certification unless only one answer was correct on a specific issue. 


PAVE Certification 


PAVE certification would be valid for 1 year or until the next PAVE cycle. For those choosing to test during the normal
test cycle, PAVE certification would be valid from January to January. Upon successful test evaluation, developers
would be contacted by the Postal Service in writing and issued a PAVE certificate noting the specific software tested,
the categories tested, the date of certification, and the date of certification expiration. 
A list of all PAVE-certified presort product developers would be published in the Postal Bulletin or a similar publication/listing
as is currently used for CASS/MASS-certified listings. This list would include the developers name, product name,
version numbers, certified presort categories, and a company contact name and telephone number. 
PAVE certification would not remain valid if a presort product developer made significant changes to its product
within the 12 months following certification. Developers initiating such product changes would need to apply for
certification for this new, changed product. A significant change would be a key alteration of the product's basic
sortation logic; a major change in the content, layout, format, or availability of computer generated documentation
or facsimiles, or a modification that results in significant differences in software operator use.

<TEXT>
 

Some software changes would not be significant enough to require recertification. PAVE-certified presort product
developers would be required to notify the Postal Service whenever changes were made to their certified products
to determine whether recertification were necessary. To aid in the quick release of improved presort products to
accommodate mailing industry needs, the Postal Service proposes the establishment of a toll-free telephone number,
to obtain information on whether the changes would warrant recertification. 



DMM-Initiated PAVE Cycle 



Any significant change in the make-up and preparation standards for presorting might intersect the normal 12-month
PAVE certification period. Such a change might require a presort product developer to modify its product enough to
trigger a recertification or a DMM-initiated PAVE cycle. To provide time for recertification, the Postal Service
would attempt to delay implementation of significant presort standard changes (those deemed significant enough
to require recertification) by 120 days whenever practicable. The Postal Service would implement these changes
120 days after the final date of notification (i.e., the date of publication of the final 

Federal Register

 rule) whenever possible. (Some changes, such as those resulting from congressional action or postal rate commission
proceedings, might require more immediate implementation.) 

If the Postal Service conducted PAVE testing out of the normal cycle to accommodate such DMM changes, presort products
tested and approved during this time would maintain certification for 1 year beyond the next normal test period. For
instance, if a DMM change became effective May 1995, a presort product that became PAVE-certified in July 1995 (out
of cycle to meet the new standard) would be issued a PAVE certificate valid from July 1995 until January 1997 (unless
further DMM changes warranted significant software updating). 



Out-of-Cycle Fees 



Participating in the PAVE certification program during the normal testing cycle would be free of charge. In those
instances when a DMM-initiated PAVE cycle was conducted, participation would also be free of charge. A fee, however,
would be charged for those participating in the PAVE program outside the normal test cycle. This fee would be assessed
as follows:




Test File_Initial presort category (file generation, postage and handling)_$50.00 



($10.00 for each additional test category requested at the same time) 



Certification_Results evaluation (presort analysis and documentation review)_$200.00 



($25.00 for each additional test category submitted at the same time) 



Minimum Fee_$250.00

 


Out-of-cycle PAVE certifications would expire at the end of the next normal test cycle (e.g., a certification obtained
in June would expire December 31 of that same year). 



PAVE Test Failures 



Participants would receive notification of errors during PAVE test evaluations so that retesting could be accomplished
within the normal PAVE cycle. Although November 15 through December 31 is proposed as an established time frame for
retesting, the Postal Service would strive to expedite the mailing and evaluation of retests whenever possible.
The first 2 attempts for a specific category would be free of charge. All subsequent certification attempts would
be charged the out-of-cycle fees. 

Software not achieving certification prior to December 31 would not be included in the list of PAVE-certified presort
product developers to be published in January of each year.

Standardization of Testing Data 


Based on a variety of previous comments, the Postal Service would not mandate standardization of presort software
documentation, layout, and format with this proposal. The mailing documentation currently generated by presort
software would be evaluated to ensure that all data necessary to support the rates claimed in the mailing category
tested were present and could be readily identified and understood.

The Postal Service believes, however, that eventually a more common framework for test results needs to be established
to have an efficient, accurate PAVE review and certification process.

The Postal Service proposes to explore the feasibility of having software manufacturers return an electronic file
rather than hard copy documentation for future PAVE testing. From this electronic file, the Postal Service could
perform computer analysis of PAVE test results, begin to develop analysis software for a computer grading solution,
or print documentation in a common format for ease of review. In order to pursue this concept, the Postal Service would
need to establish a common electronic file structure with standardized data fields.

Although the issue of using an electronic file is not specifically part of this proposed rule (hard copy documentation
is proposed for manual evaluation for initial PAVE tests), comments concerning its eventual implementation are
requested. A potential file structure has been drafted and is available on request to those wishing to comment on its
content and layout.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 


On May 12, 1994, the Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ, the Institute for Public Representation,
and the Minority Media and Employment Council (hereinafter ``Petitioners'') filed a Request for Extension of Time
to Submit Comments to the Commission's Notice of Inquiry, FCC 94-103, released April 12, 1994. Petitioners
requested that we extend the dates for submission of comments 21 days, through and including June 13, 1994, and give
a comparable extension of time for the submission of reply comments. We believe that the petitioners in this case may
be in a particularly good position to assist the Commission given their longstanding involvement in these issues.
Accordingly, we grant the requested relief. We extend the dates for filing comments and reply comments in this proceeding
to June 13, 1994, and June 28, 1994, respectively.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 







Order Granting Motion for Extension of Time to File Comments 




Adopted: May 16, 1994


Released: May 16, 1994



By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau:
1. On April 20, 1994, the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiry, FCC 94-103, released April 21, 1994, to obtain
comment on the effectiveness of the Commission's rules, procedures, policies, standards and guidelines in promoting
equality of employment opportunity. Comment and Reply Comment dates were established for May 23, 1994, and June 7,
1994, respectively.

2. On May 12, 1994, the Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ, the Institute for Public Representation,
and the Minority Media and Employment Council (hereinafter ``Petitioners'') filed a Request For Extension of Time
to Submit Comments. Petitioners requested that we extend the dates for submission of comments 21 days, through and
including June 13, 1994, and give a comparable extension of time for the submission of reply comments. In support of
their request petitioners stated that the 30 day time period is an insufficient amount of time to prepare a comprehensive
response to issues raised in the Notice. They state that they are limited in staff size and lack the resources to respond
to the Notice in such a short time. They also argue that an extension of time would aid the Commission's decisional processes
by enabling a greater number of parties to participate and by allowing them the opportunity to further the quality
of their submissions. 


3. As set forth in  1.46 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR  1.46, it is our policy that extensions of time
not be routinely granted. However, we believe that the petitioners in this case may be in a particularly good position
to assist the Commission given their longstanding involvement in these issues. Accordingly, we will grant the requested
relief. However, given the October 5th deadline for the Commission to submit its report to Congress, we do not intend
to grant further extensions of time.


4. Accordingly, it is ordered, that the Request For Extension of Time filed by Petitioners is granted. 


5. It is therefore ordered that the dates for filing comments and reply comments in this proceeding are extended to
June 13, 1994, and June 28, 1994, respective.


6. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended, 47 U.S.C.  4(i) and 303(r) and  0.204(b), 9.283 and 1.46 of the Commissions Rules, 47 CFR  0.204(b),
0.283 and 1.46.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Commission invites comments on its proposal, initiated by a request filed by Word of God Fellowship, Inc., the
licensee of television station KMPX-TV, Decatur, Texas, to amend the Commission's Rules to add the community
of Decatur, Texas, to the Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas television market. This action is taken to test the proposal for
market hyphenation through the record established based on comments filed by interested parties.

supplementary information: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, CS Docket No. 94-42, adopted May 5, 1994,
and released May 16, 1994. The complete text of this document is available for inspection and copying during normal
business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may be purchased
from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20037.


Synopsis of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making


1. The Commission, in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by the petitioner, proposed to amend  76.51
of the Rules to add the community of Decatur, Texas to the Dallas-Ft. Worth television market.
2. In evaluating past requests for hyphenation of a market, the Commission has considered the following factors as
relevant to its examination: (1) the distance between the existing designated communities and the community proposed
to be added to the designation; (2) whether cable carriage, if afforded to the subject station, would extend to areas
beyond its Grade B signal coverage area; (3) the presence of a clear showing of a particularized need by the station
requesting the change of market designation; and (4) an indication of benefit to the public from the proposed change.
Each of these factors helps the Commission to evaluate individual market conditions consistent ``with the underlying
competitive purpose of the market hyphenation rule to delineate areas where stations can and do, both actually and
logically, compete.''
3. Based on the facts presented, the Commission believes that a sufficient case for redesignation of the subject market
has been set forth so that this proposal should be tested through the rulemaking process, including the comments of
interested parties. It appears from the information before us that the television stations licensed to Dallas, Ft.
Worth and Decatur do compete for audiences and advertisers in the proposed combined market area, and that evidence
has been presented tending to demonstrate commonality between the proposed community to be added to a market designation
and the market as a whole. Moreover, the petitioner's proposal appears to be consistent with the Commission's policies
regarding redesignation of a hyphenated television market.


Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


4. The Commission certifies that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to this rulemaking proceeding
because if the proposed rule amendment is promulgated, there will not be a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A few cable television
system operators will be affected by the proposed rule amendment. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of
Proposed Rule Making, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advo
