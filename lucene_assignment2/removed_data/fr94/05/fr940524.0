DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 


Agricultural Marketing Service







Onions Grown in South Texas, and Melons Grown in South Texas; Revision of Continuing Handling Regulations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule that relaxed the handling regulations for South Texas onions and melons by allowing handlers the option
to submit a shipment release form to Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) authorities at road guard stations. The
shipment release form provides adequate information to enable the TDA to determine whether the onions and melons
have been inspected and meet marketing order requirements, thereby helping ensure compliance with order provisions.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Order No. 959 (7 CFR part 959), as amended, regulating the handling of onions grown
in South Texas, and Marketing Order No. 979 (7 CFR part 979), regulating the handling of melons grown in South Texas,
hereinafter referred to as the ``orders.'' These orders are authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are 38 handlers of South Texas onions subject to regulation under Marketing Order No. 959 and 97 onion producers
in the production area. There are 19 handlers of South Texas melons subject to regulation under Marketing Order No.
979 and 40 melon producers in the production area. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small
Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural
producers as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of the handlers and producers may be
classified as small entities. 
The South Texas Onion and Melon Committees (committees) met November 9 and December 9, 1993, respectively, and discussed
procedures for clearing shipments of onions and melons at road guard stations operated by the TDA. The committees
unanimously recommended revising paragraphs (d)(2) of  959.322 and (c)(2) of  979.304, respectively,
to make the regulations consistent with current industry practice. 
Previously, the regulations specified that onion and melon shipments must be accompanied by a copy of the inspection
certificate or other documentary evidence indicating that the shipment had been inspected and met marketing order
requirements and that such documents be presented to TDA road guard authorities. This rule continues to allow shipments
of onions and melons to be accompanied by a shipment release form issued by the Federal or Federal-State Inspection
Service which would be surrendered to authorities. The shipment release form identifies truck lots to which inspection
certificates are applicable and certifies that the shipment of onions or melons has been inspected and meets the respective
marketing order requirements. Thus, the shipment release form may continue to be used as proof of such clearance when
presented at a road guard station.

The TDA requested the committees to specify that TDA personnel are the proper authorities for reviewing inspection
certificates or shipment release forms at road guard stations. Therefore, the committees recommended that handlers
be required to surrender either the appropriate inspection certificate or shipment release form to TDA personnel
at road guard stations. This rule enables the TDA to determine whether onions and melons shipped from the respective
production areas meet order requirements and should help ensure compliance with the two orders' provisions. 
The interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13430). That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended April 21, 1994. No comments were
received. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1988 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB No. 0581-0074 for onions and 0581-0076 for melons. This rule does not entail additional
recordkeeping on the part of the handlers because the shipment release form is not a new form. 
After consideration of the committees' recommendations and other relevant information presented, it is found that
finalizing the interim rule, without change, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Milk in the Texas Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Suspension of rule. 







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document suspends the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions of the Texas Federal milk marketing order.
The action was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), a cooperative association that represents dairy
farmers whose milk is pooled under the order. The suspension will give supply organizations, like AMPI, the flexibility
they need to market their milk supplies efficiently under today's marketing conditions. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior document in this proceeding: 




Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued April 6, 1994; published April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17498). 




The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens
the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will have their milk
priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. 




The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 




This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have
a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 




The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 




This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the
order regulating the handling of milk in the Texas marketing area. 




Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17498) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions (or sections) of the order.
Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. No opposing views
were received. 




After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice and other available information,
it is hereby found and determined that from the date this order is published in the 

Federal Register

 the following provisions (or sections) of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 




In  1126.12, paragraph (b)(5) in its entirety. 




Statement of Consideration 




The suspension order makes inoperative the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions of the Texas milk order
(Order 126). By suspending these provisions, the milk of dairy farmers who were not associated with the Texas market
in September-November could be used to supply Order 126 distributing plants during the following months of February-July.


In its letter requesting the suspension, Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), stated that in some instances these
provisions prevent the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficiently. Because of the limitation on which
dairy farmers can be producers under the Texas order during the months of February-July, AMPI was unable to pool
more than two million pounds of milk it supplied to an Order 126 distributing plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, during
February 1994. The milk of these dairy farmers, who are more favorably located with respect to the Little Rock plant
than are the cooperative's Texas producers, was not eligible for pool status because the dairy farmers had not been
associated with the Texas market to the extent necessary during the preceding months of September-November. Also,
if AMPI supplies the Arkansas plant with milk of eligible Texas producers, the cooperative suffers an economic pooling
loss because the Little Rock plant is subject to a minus 39-cent location adjustment. 

The market's supply/demand relationship has changed dramatically since these provisions were adopted. Because
of these circumstances, as proponent requested, the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions should be suspended
indefinitely.

It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 

(a) The suspension is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area, in that such rule is necessary to permit the pooling of the milk of dairy farmers without the need
for making costly and inefficient movements of milk; 

(b) This suspension does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 

(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this suspension. No opposing views were filed. 

Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR</USDEPT>

Utah Regulatory Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is approving an amendment to the Utah regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'') under
the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposed revisions to rules pertaining to significant
permit revisions. The amendment was intended to improve operational efficiency and simplify the processing and
approval of coal permit changes ordered by the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Utah Program


On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated March 7, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT-899). Utah submitted the proposed amendment on its own initiative to ``streamline the Utah program
and to simplify the process for revising permits.'' The provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed
to revise were Utah Administrative Rules (Utah Admin. R.) 645-303-224.400, .500, and .600, regarding
the requirements for significant permit revisions.
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the March 28, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14377), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT-910). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended on April 27, 1994.


III. Director's Findings


As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program
amendment submitted by Utah on March 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations and
no less stringent than SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director approves the proposed amendment.


Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400, .500, and .600, Significant Permit Revisions


Utah's rules at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224 set forth those conditions under which an operator's application
for a permit change must be processed by Utah as a significant permit revision. In these rules, Utah proposed to delete
Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400 and to recodify Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.500 and .600 as
Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400 and .500, respectively. The rule proposed for deletion requires that
permit changes that are ordered by the Division in accordance with Utah Admin. R. 645-303-212 and 213 (the
provisions authorizing the Division to order permit revisions) must always be processed as significant permit revisions.
The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires each State with primacy to establish guidelines for determining
when a permit revision must be subjected to all of the permit application information requirements and procedures
of 30 CFR, Subchapter G, including the notice, public participation, and notice of decision requirements at 30 CFR
773.13, 773.19(b) (1) and (3), and 778.21. In addition, 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) requires that the above requirements
and procedures shall apply, at a minimum, to all ``significant'' permit revisions. The Federal regulation does not
define the term ``significant.'' Instead, the Federal regulation allows each State to determine, for itself, when
a permit revision is significant, and when it is not significant.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-0-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Utah has met the above Federal requirement by promulgating the criteria at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.100
through .600, which determine when a permit change must be processed as a ``significant'' permit revision. Under
Utah's program, at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-226, a significant permit revision is subjected to all of the
permit application information requirements at Utah Admin. R. 645-300-100, 645-300-200,
645-301, and 645-302.

One of the criteria for determining when a permit change must be processed as a significant permit revision is existing
Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400, which requires that, when a permit change is ordered by the Division,
rather than proposed by an operator on its own initiative, the permit change must be processed as a significant permit
revision. As set forth at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-211 through 645-303-213, division-ordered
permit changes are required when the review of a permit reveals that a change in the permit is needed to ensure compliance
with the State program.

Since the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2) does not require that 

any

 specific kind of permit revision be processed as a ``significant'' revision, it does not require that a permit revision
ordered by a State regulatory authority be processed as a significant permit revision. Therefore, Utah's proposal
to delete from its program the requirement at Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400 that all permit changes ordered
by the Division be processed as significant permit revisions is not inconsistent with and is no less effective than
the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2). Therefore, the Director approves the proposed deletion and recodification.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



1. Public Comments



OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment, but none were received.



2. Federal Agency Comments



Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Utah program.

The U.S. Bureau of Mines responded on March 27, 1994, by telephone conversation, that it had no comments on the proposed
amendment (administrative record No. UT-905).



3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. Therefore,
OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.

Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record
No. UT-902). It responded on March 30, 1994, that it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative
record No. UT-912).



4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP)



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and the ACHP. Neither
the SHPO nor the ACHP responded to OSM's request.



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above finding, the Director approves Utah's proposed amendment as submitted on March 7, 1994.

The Director approves Utah's revisions of its significant permit revision rules, including the deletion of Utah
Admin. R. 645-303-224.400 and the recodification of Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.500 and .600
as Utah Admin. R. 645-303-224.400 and .500, respectively.

The Director approves the rules as proposed by Utah with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical
form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 944, codifying decisions concerning the Utah program, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.



VI. Procedural Determinations



1. Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the March 4, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (FR Doc. 94-4900) (59 FR 10290), we implemented certain provisions of section 1842(p) of the Social Security
Act, which require that each bill or request for payment for a service furnished by a physician under Medicare Part
B include appropriate diagnostic coding for the diagnosis or the symptoms of the illness or injury for which the Medicare
beneficiary received care. This notice corrects an error made in that document. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
In the March 4, 1994 final rule, we inadvertently failed to revise the regulations text to remove a parenthetical reference
to bills for ambulance services. The requirement for diagnostic coding does not apply to bills for ambulance services.
Therefore, we are making the following correction to the March 4, 1994 final rule:

ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule increases the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) chargeable (subsidized) rates, which apply
to all structures located in communities participating in the Emergency Program of the NFIP and to certain structures
in communities in the Regular Program of the NFIP. The rule is to help the NFIP satisfy the premium requirements for
the historical average loss year and to reduce the general taxpayers' burden with a more equitable sharing of the costs
of flood losses between general taxpayers and the insureds.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 21, 1994, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) published in the 

Federal Register

 (Vol. 59, Page 13298) a proposed rule to increase the chargeable (subsidized) rates. The chargeable (subsidized)
rates, for which an increase was proposed, are the rates applicable to structures located in communities participating
in the Emergency Program of the NFIP and to certain structures in communities in the Regular Program of the NFIP. They
are countrywide rates for two broad building type classifications which, when applied to the amount of insurance
purchased and added to the expense constant and Federal policy fee, produce a premium income somewhat less than the
expense and loss payments incurred on the flood insurance policies issued on that basis. The funds needed to supplement
the inadequate premium income are provided by the National Flood Insurance Fund. The subsidized rates are promulgated
by the Administrator for use under the Emergency Program (added to the NFIP by the Congress in Section 408 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1969) and for use in the Regular Program on construction or substantial improvements
started before the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or on or before December 31, 1974 (this
additional grandfathering was added to the NFIP by Congress in section 103 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973), whichever is later. 



FEMA proposed to increase the chargeable or subsidized rates as follows: 






For comparison, the current subsidized rates are as follows:

A 45-day period (ending on May 5, 1994) was provided for review and comment on the proposed changes. No comments were
received during the comment period. Therefore, the revision increasing the chargeable (subsidized) rates is incorporated
into the final rule as proposed, without change. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4371

 and the implementing regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508, FEMA has
prepared an environmental assessment of the issuance by FEMA of this final rule. The assessment concludes that there
will be no significant impact on the human environment as a result of the issuance of the final rule. It is, therefore,
found that the action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment. On this basis, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Copies of the environmental
assessment are available for inspection at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, room 840, 500 C St., SW., Washington,
DC 20472. 



Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review 



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993,
Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993. To the extent possible, this rule adheres to the principles
of regulation set forth in this Executive Order. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



This final rule does not contain a collection of information requirement as described in section 3504(h) of the Paperwork
Reduction Act. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



This final rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism,
dated October 26, 1987.

Summary of the Third Report and Order



Introduction



1. In this Third Report and Order, we adopt service-specific rules for competitive bidding on licenses to be awarded
for Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (``narrowband PCS''). We conclude that because of the significant
interdependence among narrowband PCS licenses and the relatively high expected value of such licenses, most narrowband
PCS licenses will be awarded through a sequence of simultaneous multiple round auctions. We will also adopt a system
of preferences designed to enhance access to narrowband PCS spectrum and achieve the congressional directive that
our competitive bidding rules ensure the opportunity of small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities
to participate in the auction process.

2. Numerous comments and reply comments were filed by interested parties in response to the notice of proposed rule
making (58 FR 53489 (October 15, 1993)) in this docket. These comments address the many proposals made in the notice
regarding, among other things, narrowband PCS licenses.



Auction Eligibility



3. In the Second Report and Order (59 FR 22980 (May 4, 1994)), we concluded that narrowband PCS as a class of service was
reasonably likely to satisfy the criteria of section 309(j) of the Communications Act. Also, the use of competitive
bidding to award narrowband PCS licenses as compared to other licensing methods will speed the development and deployment
of new services to the public and recover for the public a portion of the value of the spectrum.



Auction Design



4. The spectrum allocation, service definition and technical rules for narrowband PCS were completed by the Commission
in the Narrowband PCS Memorandum Opinion and Order (59 FR 14115 (March 25, 1994)). We anticipated that advanced paging
and messaging services would be the predominant narrowband services provided. Three megahertz of spectrum were
allocated to narrowband PCS in three one megahertz bands (901-902 MHz, 930-931 MHz and 940-941 MHz).
Two megahertz of this spectrum were divided into 50 kHz and 12.5 kHz channels and will be available for immediate licensing.
The remaining one megahertz of narrowband PCS spectrum will be channelized and licensed in the future as this service
develops.

5. 

Simultaneous multiple round auction.

 In This Report and Order, we adopt simultaneous multiple round auctions as our primary auction methodology for narrowband
PCS licenses. We expect the value of most narrowband PCS licenses to be sufficiently high to warrant the use of simultaneous
auctions. This type of auction will be most likely to deploy rapidly new narrowband PCS technologies and services,
promote the development of competition for the provision of those and other services, and thus foster economic growth.
We recognize, however, that simultaneous multiple round bidding may involve a greater degree of complexity than
other competitive bidding methods and that it may present greater operational difficulties for both the Commission
and for bidders.

6. 

Alternative auction designs.

 Because narrowband PCS licenses vary in terms of expected value and interdependence, we have determined that no single
competitive bidding design will be optimal for all licenses. For this reason and because Congress directed us to test
multiple alternative methodologies, we will adopt other auction designs as alternatives to our primary design.
When we announce individual auctions to award specific groups of narrowband licenses, we will issue a public notice
detailing the competitive bidding design and procedures to be used.

7. 

Oral sequential and single round (sealed bid) auctions.

 If, as a result of our auction experience, we determine that the operational costs or complexities associated with
simultaneous multiple round auctions outweigh their benefits, we may decide to employ either oral sequential auctions
or single round sealed bid auctions. In an oral sequential auction, licenses are put up for bid one at a time, so that
bidding ends on one item before it begins on the next item. Oral sequential auctions generate valuable information
about earlier auctioned licenses, which can assist bidders in valuing later auctioned licenses. However, if license
values are interdependent oral sequential auctions are less likely than simultaneous auctions to award interdependent
licenses to the parties who value them the most and to aggregate licenses efficiently, because bidders for licenses
that are auctioned early must bid with less information about the value of licenses to be auctioned later, and have
less opportunity to pursue backup bidding strategies. Nonetheless, because oral sequential auctions are generally
less complex, and costly both for the FCC and for potential bidders, they may be appropriate to use where the expected
value of the narrowband PCS licenses to be auctioned is low relative to the costs of conducting a more complex auction
or where interdependence is less significant.

8. We may find, for some narrowband PCS licenses that even the lesser cost and complexity of oral sequential auctions
are not justified by the revenues these licenses would be expected to generate. In such cases, we may choose to award
licenses by single round sealed bidding where bids for all licenses are submitted simultaneously and the high bidder
for each license is determined after a single round of bidding. Single round sealed bidding has the principal advantage
of being relatively simple for bidders to understand and inexpensive for the FCC to administer and also can generally
be completed fairly rapidly. However, because single round sealed bidding provides less information and flexibility
to bidders than either simultaneous or sequential auctions, we will generally use this method only where there is
less interdependence among individual licenses or groups of licenses and the expected value of the licenses to be
auctioned is low relative to the cost of conducting a more complex auction. In addition, we may select this auction
design where eligibility requirements limit participation to relatively few bidders.

9. 

Combinatorial bidding

. Although we recognize that there are significant benefits associated with combinatorial bidding, especially
in terms of efficient aggregation of licenses, we conclude that simultaneous multiple round auctions offer many
of these same advantages without the same degree of administrative and operational complexity and without biasing
auction outcomes in favor of combination bids. Since simultaneous multiple round bidding is our preferred auction
method for awarding narrowband PCS licenses, we think combinatorial bidding will be unnecessary in most narrowband
PCS auctions. However, in circumstances where we do not use simultaneous multiple round bidding, we may permit combinatorial
bidding. 



Bidding Procedures 



10. 

Grouping of licenses

. Whether we use our preferred approach of a sequence of simultaneous multiple round auctions or sequential individual
auctions, the Commission must choose which licenses will be auctioned together. The importance of the choice of license
grouping increases with the degree of interdependence among the individual licenses or groups of licenses to be auctioned.
Accordingly, we will group narrowband PCS licenses into the various simultaneous auctions by aggregating together
those licenses exhibiting the greatest degree of interdependence so that there will be limited interdependence
across groups. 

11. Based on the foregoing, we will auction narrowband PCS licenses in the following license groupings. We will award
all nationwide, regional and MTA (other than MTA response channels) licenses through a sequential series of simultaneous
auctions. (However, as we gain experience we may determine that an alternative auction method or license grouping
is more appropriate. Under these circumstances, as provided in the general procedural rules, we will announce before
each auction the licenses to be auctioned and the type of competitive bidding method to be used, as well as the stopping
rules and activity rules, if any, that will be used.) To maximize the information available to bidders and increase
gradually the complexity of the narrowband PCS auctions as we gain more experience, we will begin by auctioning the
ten nationwide narrowband licenses in one simultaneous multiple round auction. 
After the nationwide narrowband PCS auction is complete, we will auction the five regional blocks (30 licenses) together
in one simultaneous multiple round auction. We subsequently will conduct another simultaneous multiple round auction
for all of the 50/50 kHz paired, 50/12.5 kHz paired and the 50 kHz unpaired MTA licenses (357 licenses). Simultaneous
multiple round auctions are appropriate for each of these license groupings because of the relatively high value
and significant interdependence of the licenses. 

12. After auctioning the MTA licenses, we will hold another simultaneous multiple round auction for the 50/12.5 kHz
paired BTA licenses (984 licenses). Although most of the licenses are expected to have relatively low values, individually
they are highly interdependent, and their aggregate value (compared to the cost of conducting a simultaneous auction)
is sufficiently high to justify a simultaneous multiple round auction. Using this approach will also enable the Commission
to gain valuable experience conducting simultaneous multiple round auctions involving large numbers of licenses.



13. Finally, we will auction the 12.5 kHz unpaired MTA (204 licenses) and the 12.5 kHz unpaired BTA response channel
licenses (1,968 licenses) in a single round sealed bid auction because their values are low relative to the cost of
conducting other more complex auctions. Under this auction method, however, bidders cannot be certain that they
will be the high bidder on all of the licenses they seek to obtain because single round sealed bidding does not provides
bidders with timely information about license values and bidders do not have the opportunity to increase their bid
amounts during the course of the auction. Therefore, in this context we will allow bidders to bid on more licenses than
they are eligible to be awarded under the existing aggregation limits, provided they specify in advance the order
in which they wish to be awarded such licenses in the event that they are in high bidder on more licenses then they are
permitted to hold. See 47 CFR 24.130(a) (limiting paging licensees to a maximum of two response channel licenses within
the same geographic area). Bidders, however, will only be permitted to bid on response channel licenses for which
they are otherwise eligible (i.e., they must operate at least one base station in the service area of the response channel
for which they are applying). The Commission will only designate a bidder the winning bidder on the maximum number
of licenses the bidder is eligible to hold. Under these circumstances, a high bidder will not be subject to the bid withdrawal
penalty for those additional licenses for which it is not designated the winning bidder. 

14. 

Bid increments

. Where we use simultaneous multiple round auctions to award narrowband PCS licenses it is important to specify minimum
bid increments. In these auctions, we may impose a minimum bid increment of 5 percent or $0.01 per pop per MHz, whichever
is greater. This will provide flexibility for a wide range of different license values and will ensure timely closure
of auctions, even where bidding begins at a very low dollar amount. The Commission retains the discretion in narrowband
PCS auctions to set and, by announcement before or during the auction, vary the minimum bid increments for individual
licenses or groups of licenses over the course of an auction. We will most likely reduce the minimum bid increment only
in the later bidding rounds, as bidding begins to come to a close. In oral sequential auctions the auctioneer may within
its sole discretion establish and vary the amount of the minimum bid increment in each round of bidding. 

15. 

Stopping rules for multiple round auctions

. Where we use simultaneous multiple round bidding, we believe that a simultaneous stopping rule is preferable, especially
for the nationwide, regional and MTA narrowband PCS licenses, which are expected to have relatively high values and
are fewer in number. Because of the large number of BTA licenses and their relatively low expected value, we may use
either a hybrid stopping rule or allow markets to close individually in auctions for these licenses.

<TEXT>
 

16. We will retain the discretion to declare at any point in a simultaneous multiple round auction that the auction
will end after one additional round or some other specified number of additional rounds. We also reserve the discretion
to vary the duration of bidding rounds or the interval at which bids are accepted in order to move the auction toward
closure more quickly. We will announce by public notice, and may vary by announcement during an auction, the duration
and intervals between bidding rounds.
17. 

Activity rules. 

In order to ensure that simultaneous auctions with simultaneous stopping rules close within a reasonable period
of time, it is necessary to impose an activity rule to prevent bidders from waiting until the end of the auction before
participating. The rule proposed by Professors Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson (``Milgrom-Wilson rule'') will best
achieve the Commission's goal of affording bidders flexibility to pursue back up strategies, while at the same time
ensuring that simultaneous auctions are concluded within a reasonable period of time. Therefore, to award higher
value narrowband PCS licenses, we plan to use the Milgrom-Wilson rule with a simultaneous stopping rule.
18. Under the Milgrom-Wilson rule, the minimum activity level, measured as a fraction of the self declared maximum
eligibility, would increase during the course of the auction. The auction would be divided into three stages. During
the first stage of the auction, bidders would be required to be active on licenses encompassing at least one-third
of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the second stage, bidders would be required to be active on licenses
encompassing at least two-thirds of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. In the third stage, bidders would be
required to be active on licenses encompassing 100 percent of the MHz-pops for which they are eligible. Under this
rule, bidders would be required to meet these activity levels to retain their desired eligibility. A shortfall in
activity would reduce eligibility levels accordingly. However, bidders will be permitted five automatic waivers
from the activity rule during the course of an auction. We also retain the discretion to use less complex activity rules.


Procedural, Payment, and Penalty Matters


19. 

Pre-auction procedures. 

We will follow the procedural, payment and penalty rules established in the Second Report and Order with certain minor
modifications designed to address the characteristics of the narrowband PCS service. Before each scheduled narrowband
PCS auction the Commission, or pursuant to delegated authority, a Bureau will release an initial Public Notice announcing
the auction. This initial Public Notice will specify the license(s) to be auctioned and the time, place and method
of competitive bidding to be used, including applicable bid procedures. The initial public notice will also specify
the filing deadline for short-form applications.
20. All bidders will be required to submit short-form applications on FCC Form 175 by the date specified in the public
notice. If only one application is received, the Commission will by public notice cancel the auction for this license
and establish a date for the filing of a long-form application, the acceptance of which will trigger the procedures
permitting petitions to deny. The Commission will issue a second Public Notice listing all defective applications
and applicants will be given a chance to cure and resubmit applications with minor defects.
21. After reviewing the corrected applications, the Commission will release a third public notice announcing the
names of all applicants whose applications have been accepted. These applicants will then be required to submit the
full amount of their upfront payment to the Commission's lock-box bank by a date specified in the public notice. A fourth
public notice announcing the names of all applicants that have been determined to be qualified to bid will then be issued.
Each of these applicants will receive a bidder identification number and further instructions regarding auction
procedures.
22. 

Upfront payments. 

We will require all auction participants to tender in advance to the Commission an upfront payment as a condition of
bidding. We believe that a standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of
MHz-pops a bidder anticipates bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for narrowband PCS services.
If licenses covering the nation are being auctioned simultaneously, a bidder will not be required to file an upfront
payment representing national coverage unless it intends to bid on licenses covering the entire nation in any single
bidding round. We will announce the upfront payment amount for each license in a public notice issued prior to the auction.
23. We believe that the minimum upfront payment of $2,500 established in the Second Report and Order may be too high
for some narrowband licenses in sparsely populated areas, which may have values below this amount. Therefore, we
will establish a lower minimum upfront payment of $1,000 for narrowband PCS applications. The specific procedures
to be followed in the tendering and processing of upfront payments are set forth in Section 1.2106 of the Commission's
rules.
24. 

Down payment and full payment for licenses awarded by competitive bidding. 

Winning bidders will be required to supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to bring their
total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s). The down payment must be submitted by cashier's check or wire
transfer to our lock-box bank by a date specified, generally within five business days following the close of the bidding.
All auction winners, with the exception of certain designated entities, will be required to make full payment of the
balance of the winning bids within five business days following the award of the license. Small Businesses will be
permitted to pay 10 percent of their down payment amount within five businesses days after bidding is closed and the
remaining 10 percent within five days after grant of the license. As discussed below, small businesses will also be
permitted to pay the balance of their winning bid amount for certain licenses in installments over the term of the license.
License grants will be conditioned on full payment of the bid amount.

25. 

Default and disqualification.

 Any bidder who withdraws a high bid during an auction before bidding closes, or defaults by failing to remit the required
down payment within the prescribed time, will be required to reimburse the Commission in the amount of the difference
between its high bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is auctioned, if the subsequent winning
bid is lower. After bidding closes, a defaulting or disqualified auction winner will be assessed an additional penalty
of three percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less.
Deposits will be held by the FCC until full payment of the penalty. If default of disqualification involves such actions
as gross misconduct, the Commission may declare the applicant ineligible to bid in future auctions and may take other
actions including the revocation of Commission licenses.

26. If the down payment is timely made, a long-form application filed on FCC form 401 (as modified) will be required
to be filed by a specified date, generally within 10 business days after the close of the auction. Upon acceptance for
filing of the long-form application, the FCC will release a public notice announcing this fact thus triggering the
filing window for petitions to deny. If the petitions to deny are denied, and the FCC finds the applicant qualified,
the license will be granted to the auction winner.

27. As proposed, we adopt a modified version of the application requirements and processing rules in part 22 of the
Commission's rules for narrowband PCS. These rules govern such matters as application filing and content requirements,
waiver procedures, procedures for returning defective applications, and procedures regarding the modification
of applications.

28. With regard to petitions to deny, we adopt expedited procedures consistent with the provisions of section 309(i)(2)
of the Communications Act for narrowband PCS applications. A hearing need not be conducted before denial of a petition
to deny if the Commission determines that an applicant is not qualified and no substantial issue of fact exists concerning
that determination. If the FCC identifies substantial and material issues of fact in need of resolution, section
309(i)(2) of the Act permits in any hearing submission for all or part of the evidence in written form and allows employees
other than administrative law judges to conduct hearings.

29. As a general rule, when an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified after having made the required
down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license either to existing or new applicants. However,
if the default occurs within five (5) businesses days after bidding has closed, the Commission retains the discretion
to offer the license to the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer
the license to other bidders (in descending order of their bid amounts) at their final bid levels.

30. If a new auction becomes necessary because of default or disqualification more than five (5) business days after
bidding has ended the Commission will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications because so much time
is likely to have passed that different parties may be interested in bidding and existing applicants may have different
valuations of the license.



Procedures in Other Auction Designs



31. 

Single round bidding.

 Where we use sealed bidding, in addition to the information specified above, the initial public notice will specify
the date on which sealed bids must be submitted. In single round sealed bid auctions, we will not require bidders to
submit upfront payments because we believe that there is less risk of frivolous bidding when this auction design is
used. We may, however, announce by public notice that bidders must tender the 20 percent down payment at the time they
submit their buds in order to ensure payment of the penalty in case of bid withdrawal or default. In single round sealed
bid auctions, we will require that bids be received on a date specified in the public notice and that bids clearly indicate
the bidder's identification number and the auction and license to which the bid relates. Bidders submitting bids
for more licenses than they are permitted to hold must also specify the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses
if they are the high bidder on more licenses then they are eligible to hold. After bids are submitted and evaluated,
the Commission will issue a second public notice indicating all bidders who have made timely bid submissions. After
release of the second public notice, the Commission will issue a third public notice announcing the high bidders on
each license. (If a tie occurs, bidders will be afforded the opportunity to submit another bid and the highest bidder
in this round will be designated the winning bidder.) If the 20 percent deposit has not already been submitted, then
the high bidder will be required to submit the 20 percent down payment within five (5) business days after release of
the public notice announcing the high bidders (if the 20 percent down payment has already been submitted, the Commission
will simply deposit the high bidder's down payment).

32. In the case of single round bidding, the withdrawal and default penalties must be modified to reflect the fact that
bids cannot be withdrawn during the course of an auction because there is only a single round of bidding. In this context,
if a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the public notice announcing the high bidders, no harm is likely
to occur and no penalty will be assessed because the Commission can easily designate in the public notice that the party
with the next highest bid is the winning bidder. If, however, a high bidder in a single round auction defaults after
release of the public notice announcing the high bidders, the licensing process is likely to be delayed. Therefore,
in order to encourage bidders in single round auctions to avoid default and the associated delays, we will impose a
default penalty if a high bidder withdraws, defaults or is otherwise disqualified after release of the public notice
announcing the winning bidders. This penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and the amount
of the next highest valid bid. A bid will be considered valid for this purpose if the bidder has not already been designated
the winning bidder on more licenses than it is permitted to be awarded.

<TEXT>
 

33. Bidders will be held to their bids on the maximum number of licenses they are permitted to hold. If there are multiple
defaults each bidder will be responsible for the difference between its bid and the amount of the next highest valid
bid. Holding each bidder in a single round auction responsible for the difference between its bid and the next highest
valid bid will discourage cascading defaults, without penalizing bidders for bidding on more licenses than they
are permitted to hold. Losing bidders, may decline a defaulted license without penalty if such default occurs more
than 30 days after the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidders. Where a bidder
defaults or is disqualified more than 30 days after the release of the initial public notice announcing the winning
bidders the Commission retains the discretion to either offer the license to the bidder with the next highest valid
bid at its original bid price or re-auction the license. If the Commission re-auctions the license, new applications
will be accepted and the additional three percent penalty will apply.

34. 

Oral sequential auctions.

 Where oral sequential bidding is employed, the general procedures described above will be followed with one exception.
Qualified bidders will be required to bring a cashier's check for the full amount of their upfront payment to the auction
site. Bidders will be required to display their upfront payment check as a condition of being issued a bidder identification
number and admittance to the bidder section of the auction site. After bidding closes on a particular license, the
high bidder will be asked to tender its upfront payment and sign a bid confirmation form. If the high bidder declines
to tender the upfront payment and/or refuses to sign the bid confirmation form, no penalty will be assessed because
the license would be immediately re-auctioned. The only damage from such withdrawal would be delay. And in an oral
sequential auction such delay may be minimal. The standard default penalty and the additional three percent penalty
will be assessed, however, if the bidder defaults on the 20 percent down payment, fails to pay for the license or is disqualified
after the close of an auction.



Regulatory Safeguards



35. 

Unjust enrichment provisions.

 The transfer disclosure requirements in section 1.2111(a) of our rules, adopted in the Second Report and Order, will
apply to all narrowband PCS licenses obtained through the competitive bidding process. Generally, applicants transferring
their licenses within three years after the initial license grant will be required to file, together with their transfer
application, the associated contracts for sale and all other documents disclosing the total consideration received
in return for the transfer of its license.

36. 

Performance requirements.

 The narrowband PCS service rules contain specific performance requirements, such as the requirement to construct
within a specified period of time. Failure to satisfy these construction requirements will result in forfeiture
of the license. Therefore, additional performance requirements are not necessary.

37. 

Rules prohibiting collusion.

 The rules prohibiting collusion, adopted in the Second Report and Order, apply to all auctionable services including
narrowband PCS. Bidders will generally be required to identify on their Form 175 applications all parties with whom
they have arrangements or agreements which relate to the competitive bidding process. Bidders will also be required
to provide certifications that they have entered into no other agreements. After the short-form application is filed,
and prior to the down payment of a winning bid, bidders are prohibited from collaborating or discussing the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies with bidders not members of a bidding consortium previously identified in the
short-form application.

38. Winning bidders are required to attach as an exhibit to the Form 401 application a detailed explanation of the terms,
conditions and parties in any agreement relating to the competitive bidding process. All such arrangements must
have been entered into prior to the filing of short-form applications. Specific instances of collusion in the competitive
bidding process may result in investigation by the FCC or referral to the United States Department of Justice for investigation.
Adjudicated violations of our rules or the anti-trust laws may result in forfeiture of payments, license revocations
and prohibition from participation in future auctions.



Designated Entity Preferences



39. 

Bidding credits.

 In this Report and Order, we adopt specific preferences for narrowband PCS designed to ensure that designated entities
are given the opportunity to participate in the competitive bidding process and the provision of narrowband PCS services.
We will make a 25 percent bidding credit available to businesses owned by women and minorities bidding on the following
licenses: (1) The nationwide license on Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel 11; (2) all regional licenses on Channel 13
and Channel 17; (3) all MTA licenses on Channel 19, Channel 22, Channel 24; and (4) all BTA licenses on Channel 26.

40. Given the history of under-representation of minorities and women in telecommunications and the inability of
these groups to access financing, we find that the best way we can accomplish these statutory mandates is to provide
bidding credits exclusively to minority and female-owned businesses, regardless of their status as small or large
entities. We think that a 25 percent bidding credit is sufficient to ensure minority and female entry. It is not so substantial,
however, as to foster participation by firms that are not otherwise financially capable of building-out a narrowband
PCS network. We will also monitor carefully the effectiveness of the 25 percent bidding credit in the narrowband PCS
auctions and continually assess whether it is achieving the goal of ensuring that minority and women-owned firms
participate successfully in auctions for this service.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

41. To prevent unjust enrichment by women and minorities trafficking in licenses acquired through the use of bidding
credits, we will impose a forfeiture requirement on transfers of such licenses to entities that are not owned by women
or minorities. The penalty required will be reimbursement to the government for the amount of the bidding credit,
plus interest, before transfer will be permitted. The amount of the penalty will be reduced over time. To ensure that
only legitimate minority and women-owned firms are able to take advantage of bidding credits, strict eligibility
criteria have been adopted (in the Second Report and Order). Also, to ensure that our rules are narrowly tailored while
meeting the statutory goal of providing opportunities for women and minorities to participate in the telecommunications
industry, publicly-traded companies are prohibited from taking advantage of bidding credits.

42. 

Tax certificates.

 Tax certificates will be issued to initial investors in minority and female-owned enterprises upon divestiture
of their interests, and to licensees who transfer their authorizations to minority and female-owned businesses.
In implementing this program, we will borrow from our existing tax certificate program and grant tax certificates,
upon request, that will enable the licensees and investors to defer the gain realized upon a sale either by: (1) Treating
it as an involuntary conversion under 26 U.S.C. 1033, with the recognition of gain avoided by the acquisition of qualified
replacement property; or (2) electing to reduce the basis of certain depreciable property, or both.

43. Tax certificates will be available to initial investors who provide ``start-up'' financing and investors who
purchase shares within the first year after license issuance. To be eligible for a tax certificate, such investor
transactions must not reduce minority or female ownership or control in the entity below 50.1 percent. To prevent
unjust enrichment, we will impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer or assignment of narrowband PCS
licenses obtained thorough the benefit of tax certificates.

44. 

Installment payments.

 We adopt installment payments for small businesses_including small businesses owned by women and minorities and
rural telephone companies that meet the small business definition_bidding for any of the BTA, MTA or regional narrowband
PCS licenses. These licenses are appropriately sized for development by bona fide small businesses. We estimate
that the cost to build-out these licenses will be between $50,000 and $1.25 million.

45. The installment payment option will enable all small businesses to pay the full amount of their winning bid in installments
(less the upfront payment, which must be paid in full, and the down payment, half of which is due five days after the auction
closes and the other half five days after the application is granted). Generally, interest charges will be fixed at
the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for 10 year U.S. Treasury obligations. Payments of interest only will
be due for the first two years. Principal and interest will be amortized over the remaining years of the license. Timely
payment of all installments will be a condition of the license grant. If a small business making installment payments
seeks to transfer a license to a non-small business entity during the term of the license, we will require payment of
the remaining principal balance as a condition of the license transfer.



Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



Need for and Purpose of the Action



46. This rulemaking proceeding was initiated to implement section 309(j) of the Communications Act, as amended.
The rules adopted herein will carry out Congress' intent to establish a system of competitive bidding for narrowband
PCS licenses. The rules adopted herein also will carry out Congress' intent to ensure that small businesses, rural
telephone companies, and businesses owned by women and minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate in
the provision of spectrum-based services. 



Issues Raised in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



47. The IRFA noted that the proposals under consideration in the NPRM included the possibility of new reporting and
recordkeeping requirements for a number of small business entities. No commenters responded specifically to the
issues raised in the IRFA. We have made some modifications to the proposed requirements as appropriate.

24.301 Narrowband PCS subject to competitive bidding. 
24.302 Competitive bidding design for narrowband PCS licensing. 
24.303 Competitive bidding mechanisms. 
24.304 Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.

Subpart F_Competitive Bidding Procedures for Narrowband PCS 



 24.301 

Narrowband PCS subject to competitive bidding. 



Mutually exclusive initial applications to provide narrowband PCS service are subject to competitive bidding procedures.
The general competitive bidding procedures found in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q, will apply unless otherwise provided
in this part. 



 24.302 

Competitive bidding design for narrowband PSC licensing. 



(a) The Commission will employ the following competitive bidding designs when choosing from among mutually exclusive
initial applications to provide narrowband PCS service: 

(1) Single round sealed bid auctions (either sequential or simultaneous); 
(2) Sequential oral auctions; 
(3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions. 

(b) The Commission may design and test alternative procedures. The Commission will announce by Public Notice before
each auction the competitive bidding design to be employed in a particular auction. 

(c) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations
of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid,
a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be
used with any type of auction design. 

(d) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses
and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in
conjunction with any type of auction. 



 24.303 

Competitive bidding mechanisms. 



(a) 

Sequencing

. The Commission will establish and may vary the sequence in which narrowband PCS licenses will be auctioned. 

(b) 

Grouping

. In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial
bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. 

(c) 

Reservation Price

. The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject
to auction will not be awarded. 

(d) 

Minimum Bid Increments

. The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage
terms. 

(e) 

Stopping Rules

. The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate an auction
within a reasonable time. 

(f) 

Activity Rules

. The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. In the event that
the Commission establishes an activity rule in connection with a simultaneous multiple round auction, each bidder
will be entitled to request and will be automatically granted five (5) waivers of such rule during the course of a single
auction.

 24.304 

Withdrawal, default and disqualification penalties.



(a) When the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to  24.302(a)(3), the Commission
will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default on payments
due after an auction closes or who are disqualified.

(1) 

Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction.

 A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference
between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal
penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted
from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission.

(2) 

Default or disqualification after close of auction.

 If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject
to the penalty in paragraph (a)(1) of this section plus an additional penalty equal to three (3) percent of the subsequent
winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will
be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments
or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission.


(b) When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may
modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that
such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above.

(c) In the case of single round bidding for narrowband PCS licenses:

(1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidder(s),
no bid withdrawal penalty will be assessed.

(2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidder(s),
the bid withdrawal penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and the amount of the next highest
valid bid. A bid will be considered valid for this purpose if the bidder has not already been designated the winning
bidder on more licenses than it is permitted to be awarded. Losing bidders will only be subject to this bid withdrawal
penalty for a period of 30 days after the Commission releases the initial public notice announcing the winning bidders.

(d) In the case of oral sequential bidding for narrowband PCS licenses:

(1) If a bid is withdrawn before the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, no bid withdrawal
penalty will be assessed.

(2) If a bid is withdrawn after the Commission has declared the bidding to be closed for the license bid on, the bid withdrawal
penalty of  1.2104(g) and paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section will apply.



 24.305 

Bidding application (FCC Form 175 and 175-S Short-Form).



All applicants for initial provision of narrowband PCS service must submit applications on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S
pursuant to the procedures set forth in  1.2105 of part 1 of this chapter. The Commission will issue a public notice
announcing the date of a narrowband PCS auction, the licenses which are to be auctioned, and the date on or before which
applicants intending to participate in an upcoming narrowband PCS auction must file their applications in order
to be eligible for that auction. The public notice will also contain information necessary for completion of the application
as well as other important information such as the materials which must accompany the Forms, any filing fee that must
accompany the application or any upfront payment that will need to be submitted, and the location where the application
must be filed.



 24.306 

Submission of upfront payments and down payments.



(a) Where the Commission uses simultaneous multiple round auctions or oral sequential auctions bidders will be required
to submit an upfront payment pursuant to the procedures set forth in  1.2106 of this chapter.

(b) Winning bidders in an auction must submit a down payment to the Commission in accordance with the procedures set
forth in  1.2107 (a) and (b) of this chapter.



 24.307 

Long-Form applications.



Winning bidders will be required to submit long form applications on FCC Form 401, as modified, within ten (10) business
days after being notified that they are the winning bidder. Applications on FCC Form 401 shall be submitted pursuant
to the procedures set forth in subpart G of this part and  1.2107 (c) and (d) of this chapter and any associated
public notices. Only auction winners will be eligible to file applications on FCC Form 401 for initial narrowband
PCS licenses in the event of mutual exclusivity between applicants filing Form 175. Winning bidders need not complete
Schedule B to Form 401.



 24.308 

License grant, denial, default, and disqualification.



(a) Winning Bidders are required to pay the balance of their winning bid in a lump sum payment within five (5) business
days following the award of the license. Grant of the license will be conditioned upon full and timely payment of the
winning bid amount.

(b) A bidder who withdraws its bid, defaults on a payment or is disqualified will be subject to the penalties specified
in  1.2109 of this chapter.



 24.309 

Designated entities.



Designated entities entitled to preferences in the narrowband PCS service are small businesses and businesses owned
by members of minority groups and/or women as defined in  1.2110(b) of this chapter.

(a) 

Installment payments.

 Small businesses, including small businesses owned by women and/or minorities, will be eligible to pay the full amount

(b) 

Bidding credits.

 Businesses owned by women and/or minorities, including small businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be
eligible for a twenty-five percent (25) bidding credit when bidding on the following licenses:

(1) The nationwide licenses on Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel 11;

(2) All regional licenses on Channel 13 and Channel 17;

(3) All MTA licenses on Channel 19, Channel 22, Channel 24; and 

(4) All BTA licenses on Channel 26. See 47 CFR 24.129. 



The bidding credit will reduce by 25 percent the bid price that businesses owned by women and/or minorities will be
required to pay to obtain a license. The licenses that will be eligible for bidding credits are indicated by an (**)
in  24.129.



(c) 

Tax certificates.

 Any initial investor in a business owned by minorities and/or women and who provides ``start-up'' financing, which
allows such business to acquire a narrowband PCS license(s), and any investor who purchases an ownership interest
in a narrowband PCS licensee owned by minorities and/or women within the first year after license issuance, which
allows for the stabilization of the entity's capital base, may, upon the sale of such investment or interest, request
from the Commission a tax certificate, so long as such investor transaction does not reduce minority or female ownership
or control in the entity below 50.1 percent. Any narrowband PCS licensee who assigns or transfers control of its license
to a business owned by minorities and/or women may request that the Commission issue it a tax certificate.

(d) 

Unjust enrichment.

 Designated entities using installment payments, bidding credits or tax certificates to obtain a narrowband PCS
license will be subject to the following unjust enrichment provisions:

(1) If a small business paying for a narrowband PCS license in installment payments seeks to transfer a license to a
non-small business entity during the term of the license, the remaining principal balance must be repaid as a condition
of the license transfer.

(2) Female and minority-owned businesses seeking to transfer a license to an entity that is not owned by women or minorities
will be required to reimburse the government for the amount of the bidding credit, plus interest at the rate imposed
for installment financing at the time the license was awarded, before transfer will be permitted. The amount of this
penalty will be reduced over time as follows: a transfer in the first two years of the license term will result in a forfeiture
of 100 percent of the value of the bidding credit; in year three of the licenses term the penalty will be 75 percent; in
year four the penalty will be 50 percent and in year five the penalty will be 25 percent, after which there will be no penalty.

(3) Any business owned by minorities and or women that obtains a narrowband PCS license through the benefit of tax certificates
shall not assign or transfer control of its license within one year of its license grant date. If the assignee or transferee
is a business owned by minorities and or women, this paragraph shall not apply; Provided, however, that the assignee
or transferee shall not assign or transfer control of the license within one year of the grant date of the assignment
or transfer.

(a) 

Request for waivers. 

(1) Waivers of these rules may be granted upon application or by the Commission on its own motion. Requests for waivers
shall contain a statement of reasons sufficient to justify a waiver. Waivers will not be granted except upon an affirmative
showing:

(i) That the underlying purpose of the rule will not be served, or would be frustrated, by the application in a particular
case, and that grant of the waiver is otherwise in the public interest; or

(ii) That the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case render application of the rule inequitable, unduly
burdensome or otherwise contrary to the public interest. Applicants must also show the lack of a reasonable alternative.

(2) If the information necessary to support a waiver request is already on file, the applicant may cross-reference
to the specific filing where it may be found.

(b) 

Denial of waiver, alternate showing required. 

If a waiver is not granted, the application will be dismissed as defective unless the applicant has also provided an
alternative proposal which complies with the Commission's rules (including any required showings).



 24.420

Defective applications.



(a) Unless the Commission shall otherwise permit, an application will be unacceptable for filing and will be returned
to the applicant with a brief statement as to the omissions or discrepancies if:

(1) The application is defective with respect to completeness of answers to questions, informational showings,
execution, or other matters of a formal character; or

(2) The application does not comply with the Commission's rules, regulations, specific requirements for additional
information or other requirements. See also 47 CFR 1.2105.

(b) Some examples of common deficiencies which result in defective applications under paragraph (a) of this section
are:

(1) The application is not filled out completely and signed;

(2)-(4) [Reserved]

(5) The application (other than an application filed on FCC Form 175) does not include an environmental assessment
as required for an action that may have a significant impact upon the environment, as defined in  1.1307 of this
chapter.

(6) [Reserved]

(7) The application is filed prior to the Public Notice issued under  24.305 announcing the application filing
date for the relevant auction or after the cutoff date prescribed in that public notice; 

(c) [Reserved]

(d) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any documents or any supplementary or explanatory information
not specifically required in the prescribed application form, a failure to comply with such request within a specified
time period will be deemed to render the application defective and will subject it to dismissal.



 24.421

Inconsistent or conflicting applications.



While an application is pending and undecided, no subsequent inconsistent or conflicting application may be filed
by the same applicant, his successor or assignee, or on behalf or for the benefit of the same applicant, his successor
or assignee.



 24.422

Amendment of application for Narrowband Personal Communications Service filed on FCC Form 175.



(a) The Commission will provide bidders a limited opportunity to cure defects in FCC Form 175 specified herein except
for failure to sign the application and to make certifications, defects which may not be cured. See also 47 CFR 1.2105.

(b) In the Narrowband PCS, the only amendments to FCC Form 175 which will be permitted are minor amendments to correct
minor errors or defects such as typographical errors. All other amendments to FCC Form 175, such as ownership changes
or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, will be considered to be major amendments. An FCC
Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable
filing deadlines. See also  1.2105.

 24.423 

Amendment of applications for Narrowband Personal Communications Service (other than applications filed on FCC
Form 175).



This section applies to all applications for Narrowband Personal Communications Service other than applications
filed on FCC Form 175.

(a) 

Amendments as of right. 

A pending application may be amended as a matter of right if the application has not been designated for hearing.

(1) Amendments shall comply with  24.429, as applicable; and

(2) Amendments which resolve interference conflicts or amendments under  24.429 may be filed at any time.

(b) The Commission or the presiding officer may grant requests to amend an application designated for hearing only
if a written petition demonstrating good cause is submitted and properly served upon the parties of record.

(c) 

Major amendments, minor amendments. 

The Commission will classify all amendments as minor except in the cases listed below. An amendment shall be deemed
to be a major amendment subject to  24.427 under any of the following circumstances:

(1) Change in technical proposal. If the amendment results in a substantial change in the engineering proposal such
as (but not necessarily limited to) a change in, or an addition of, a radio frequency; or

(2) Amendment to proposed service area. If the amendment extends the reliable service area of the proposed facilities
outside its MTA, BTA, or other applicable market area as defined in  24.102; or

(3) A substantial change in ownership or control.

(d) If a petition to deny (or other formal objection) has been filed, any amendment, requests for waiver, (or other
written communications) shall be served on the petitioner, unless waiver of this requirement is granted pursuant
to paragraph (e) of this section. See also 47 CFR 1.2108.

(e) The Commission may waive the service requirements of paragraph (d) of this section and prescribe such alternative
procedures as may be appropriate under the circumstances to protect petitioners' interests and to avoid undue delay
in a proceeding, if an applicant submits a request for waiver which demonstrates that the service requirement is unreasonably
burdensome.

(f) Any amendment to an application shall be signed and shall be submitted in the same manner, and with the same number
of copies, as was the original application. Amendments may be made in letter form if they comply in all other respects
with the requirements of this chapter.

(g) An application will be considered to be a newly filed application if it is amended by a major amendment (as defined
in this section), except in the following circumstances:

(1)-(2) [Reserved]

(3) The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control found by the Commission to be in the public interest;

(4) [Reserved]

(5) The amendment corrects typographical transcription, or similar clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated
to be mistakes by reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does not create new or increased
frequency conflicts;

(6) The amendment does not create new or increased frequency conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events
which the applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such as, for example:

(i) The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation, natural causes, or loss of lease or option; or

(ii) Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the erection of a new building or other structure.



 24.424 

[Reserved].



 24.425 

Application for temporary authorizations.



(a) In circumstances requiring immediate or temporary use of facilities, request may be made for special temporary
authority to install and/or operate new or modified equipment. Any such request may be submitted as an informal application
in the manner set forth in  24.5 and must contain full particulars as to the proposed operation including all
facts sufficient to justify the temporary authority sought and the public interest therein. No such request will
be considered unless the request is received by the Commission at least 10 days prior to the date of proposed construction
or operation or, where an extension is sought, expiration date of the existing temporary authorization. A request
received within less than 10 days may be accepted upon due showing of sufficient reasons for the delay in submitting
such request.

(b) Special temporary authorizations may be granted without regard to the 30-day public notice requirements of  24.27(b)
when:

(1) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 30 days and no application for regular application is contemplated
to be filed;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-0-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The authorization is for a period not to exceed 60 days pending the filing of an application for such regular operation;

(3) The authorization is to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized construction or to provide
substantially the same service as previously authorized; or 

(4) The authorization is made upon a finding that there are extraordinary circumstances requiring operation in the
public interest and that delay in the institution of such service would seriously prejudice the public interest.

(c) Temporary authorizations of operation not to exceed 180 days may be granted under the standards of section 309(f)
of the Communications Act where extraordinary circumstances so require. Extensions of the temporary authorization
for a period of 180 days each may also be granted, but the renewal applicant bears a heavy burden to show that extraordinary
circumstances warrant such an extension.

(d) In cases of emergency found by the Commission, involving danger to life or property or due to damage of equipment,
or during a national emergency proclaimed by the President or declared by the Congress or during the continuance of
any war in which the United States is engaged and when such action is necessary for the national defense or safety or
otherwise in furtherance of the war effort, or in cases of emergency where the Commission finds that it would not be
feasible to secure renewal applications from existing licensees or otherwise to follow normal licensing procedure,
the Commission will grant radio station authorizations and station licenses, or modifications or renewals thereof,
during the emergency found by the Commission or during the continuance of any such national emergency or war, as special
temporary licenses, only for the period of emergency or war requiring such action, without the filing of formal applications.



 24.426 

Receipt of application; applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services filed on FCC Form 175 and
other applications in the narrowband PCS Service.




(a) All applications for the initial provision of narrowband PCS service must be submitted on FCC Forms 175 and 175-S.
Mutually exclusive initial applications in the narrowband Personal Communications Services are subject to competitive
bidding. FCC Form 401 (``Application for New or Modified Common Carrier Radio Station Under Part 22'') must be submitted
by each winning bidder for each narrowband PCS license applied for on FCC Form 175. In the event that mutual exclusivity
does not exist between applicants filing FCC Form 175, the applicant will also file FCC Form 401. The aforementioned
Forms 175, 175-S, and 401 are subject to the provisions of 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q (``Competitive Bidding Proceedings'')
and subpart F of this part. Blanket licenses are granted for each market frequency block. Applications for individual
sites are not needed and will not be accepted. See  24.11. 


(b) Applications received for filing are given a file number. The assignment of a file number to an application is merely
for administrative convenience and does not indicate the acceptance of the application for filing and processing.
Such assignment of a file number will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found
to be not in accordance with the Commission's rules.


(c) Acceptance of an application for filing merely means that it has been the subject of a preliminary review as to completeness.
Such acceptance will not preclude the subsequent return or dismissal of the application if it is found to be defective
or not in accordance with the Commission's rules. (See  24.413 for additional information concerning filing
of applications.)



 24.427 

Public notice period.




(a) At regular intervals, the Commission will issue a public notice listing:


(1) The acceptance for filing of all applications and major amendments thereto;


(2) Significant Commission actions concerning applications listed as acceptable for filing;


(3) Information which the Commission in its discretion believes of public significance. Such notices are solely
for the purpose of informing the public and do not create any rights in an applicant or any other person;

(4) Special environmental considerations as required by part 1 of this chapter.

(b)(1) The Commission will not grant any application until expiration of a period of thirty (30) days following the
issuance date of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments thereto, as acceptable for filing.
Provided, that the Commission will not grant an application filed on Form 401 filed either by a winning bidder or by
an applicant whose Form 175 application is not mutually exclusive with other applicants, until the expiration of
a period of forty (40) days following the issuance of a public notice listing the application, or any major amendments
thereto, as acceptable for filing. See also 47 CFR 1.2108.


(c) As an exception to paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the public notice provisions are not applicable
to applications:


(1) For authorization of a minor technical change in the facilities of an authorized station where such a change would
not be classified as a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 24.423) were such a change to be submitted as an amendment
to a pending application;


(2) For issuance of a license subsequent to a radio station authorization or, pending application for a grant of such
license, any special or temporary authorization to permit interim operation to facilitate completion of authorized
construction or to provide substantially the same service as would be authorized by such license;


(3) For extension of time to complete construction of authorized facilities, see  24.103;

(4) For temporary authorization pursuant to  24.425(b); 

(5) [Reserved]

(6) For an authorization under any of the proviso clauses of section 308(a) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.
308(a));

(7) For consent to an involuntary assignment or transfer of control of a radio authorization; or

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(8) For consent to a voluntary assignment or transfer of control of a radio authorization, where the assignment or
transfer does not involve a substantial change in ownership or control.



 24.428 

Dismissal and return of applications.




(a) Except as provided under  24.429, any application may be dismissed without prejudice as a matter of right
if the applicant requests its dismissal prior to designation for hearing or, in the case of applications filed on Forms
175 and 175-S, prior to auction. An applicant's request for the return of his application after it has been accepted
for filing will be considered to be a request for dismissal without prejudice. Applicants requesting dismissal of
their applications are also subject to 47 CFR 1.2104. Requests for dismissal shall comply with the provisions of  24.429
as appropriate.

(b) A request to dismiss an application without prejudice will be considered after designation for hearing only if:

(1) A written petition is submitted to the Commission and is properly served upon all parties of record, and

(2) The petition complies with the provisions of  24.429 (whenever applicable) and demonstrates good cause.

(c) The Commission will dismiss an application for failure to prosecute or for failure to respond substantially within
a specified time period to official correspondence or requests for additional information. Dismissal shall be without
prejudice if made prior to designation for hearing or prior to auction, but dismissal may be made with prejudice for
unsatisfactory compliance with  24.429 or after designation for hearing or after the applicant is notified
that it is the winning bidder under the auction process.



 24.429 

Ownership changes and agreements to amend or to dismiss applications or pleadings.


(a) Applicability. Subject to the provisions of 47 CFR 1.2105 (Bidding Application and Certification Procedures;
Prohibition of Collusion), this section applies to applicants and all other parties interested in pending applications
who wish to resolve contested matters among themselves with a formal or an informal agreement or understanding. This
section applies only when the agreement or understanding will result in:

(1) A major change in the ownership of an applicant to which   24.423 and 24.423(g) apply or which would
cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under  24.309, or

(2) The individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal of any pending application, amendment, petitioner
or other pleading.

(b) Policy. Parties to contested proceedings are encouraged to settle their disputes among themselves. Parties
which, under a settlement agreement, apply to the Commission for ownership changes or for the amendment or dismissal
of either pleadings or applications, shall at the time of filing notify the Commission that such filing is the result
of an agreement or understanding.

(c) If the amendment would, if granted, cause the applicant to lose its status as a designated entity under  24.309,
the applicant must comply with the obligations imposed by  24.309 (Designated Entities) and  1.2111
(Assignment of transfer of control; unjust enrichment) before the amendment will be granted.

(d) The provisions of 47 CFR 22.927 will apply in the event of the individual or mutual withdrawal, amendment or dismissal
of any pending application, amendment, petitioner or other pleading.



 24.430 

Opposition to applications.


(a) Petitions to deny (including petitions for other forms of relief) and responsive pleadings for Commission consideration
must comply with Section 1.2108 and must:
(1) Identify the application or applications (including applicant's name, station location, Commission file numbers
and radio service involved) with which it is concerned;
(2) Be filed in accordance with the pleading limitations, filing periods, and other applicable provisions of 47 CFR
1.41 through 1.52 except where otherwise provided in 47 CFR 1.2108;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940524-0-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940524-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, shall be supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which shall be sufficient to demonstrate
that the petitioner (or respondent) is a party in interest and that a grant of, or other Commission action regarding,
the application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest;

(4) Be filed within thirty (30) days after the date of public notice announcing the acceptance for filing of any such
application or major amendment thereto (unless the Commission otherwise extends the filing deadline); and 

(5) Contain a certificate of service showing that it has been mailed to the applicant no later than the date of filing
thereof with the Commission. 

(b) A petition to deny a major amendment to a previously filed application may only raise matters directly related
to the amendment which could not have been raised in connection with the underlying, previously filed application.
This does not apply to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment.



 24.431

Mutually exclusive applications.



(a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant
of one application would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference, or other practical
reason, the grant of one or more of the other applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical interference''
to mean interference which would result in a material impairment to service rendered to the public despite full cooperation
in good faith by all applicants or parties to achieve reasonable technical adjustments which would avoid electrical
conflict.

(b) Mutually exclusive applications filed on Form 175 for the initial provision of narrowband PCS service are subject
to competitive bidding in accordance with the procedures in subpart F of this part and in 47 CFR part 1, subpart Q.

(c) An application will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only
if the Commission determines that such comparative consideration will serve the public interest.



 24.432

Consideration of applications.



(a) Applications for an instrument of authorization will be granted if, upon examination of the application and upon
consideration of such other matters as it may officially notice, the Commission finds that the grant will serve the
public interest, convenience, and necessity. See also  1.2108.

(b) The grant shall be without a formal hearing if, upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections
filed, or other matters which may be officially noticed, the Commission finds that:

(1) The application is acceptable for filing, and is in accordance with the Commission's rules, regulations, and
other requirements;

(2) The application is not subject to a post-auction hearing or to comparative consideration pursuant to  24.431
with another application(s);

(3) A grant of the application would not cause harmful electrical interference to an authorized station;

(4) There are no substantial and material questions of fact presented; and

(5) The applicant is qualified under current FCC regulations and policies.

(c) If the Commission should grant without a formal hearing an application for an instrument of authorization which
is subject to a petition to deny filed in accordance with  24.430, the Commission will deny the petition by the
issuance of a Memorandum Opinion and Order which will concisely report the reasons for the denial and dispose of all
substantial issues raised by the petition.

(d) Whenever the Commission, without a formal hearing, grants any application in part, or subject to any terms or conditions
other than those normally applied to applications of the same type, it shall inform the applicant of the reasons therefor,
and the grant shall be considered final unless the Commission should revise its action (either by granting the application
as originally requested, or by designating the application for a formal evidentiary hearing) in response to a petition
for reconsideration which:

(1) Is filed by the applicant within thirty (30) days from the date of the letter or order giving the reasons for the partial
or conditioned grant; 

(2) Rejects the grant as made and explains the reasons why the application should be granted as originally requested;
and,

(3) Returns the instrument of authorization.

(e) The Commission will designate an application for a formal hearing, specifying with particularity the matters
and things in issue, if, upon consideration of the application, any pleadings or objections filed, or other matters
which may be officially noticed, the Commission determines that:

(1) A substantial and material question of fact is presented (see also  1.2108);

(2) The Commission is unable for any reason to make the findings specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the application
is acceptable for filing, complete, and in accordance with the Commission's rules, regulations, and other requirements;
or

(3) The application is entitled to comparative consideration (under  24.431) with another application (or
applications).

(f) The Commission may grant, deny or take other action with respect to an application designated for a formal hearing
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section or part 1 of this chapter.

(g) [Reserved]

(h) Reconsideration or review of any final action taken by the Commission will be in accordance with Subpart A of part
1 of this chapter.



 24.433-24.438

[Reserved]. 


 24.439

Transfer of control or assignment of station authorization.



(a) Approval required. Authorizations shall be transferred or assigned to another party, voluntarily (for example,
by contract) or involuntarily (for example, by death, bankruptcy, or legal disability), directly or indirectly
or by transfer of control of any corporation holding such authorization, only upon application and approval by the
Commission. A transfer of control or assignment of station authorization in the narrowband Personal Communications
Service is also subject to  24.309 (Designated Entities) and  1.2111 (Assignment or transfer of control:
unjust enrichment).

(1) A change from less than 50% ownership to 50% or more ownership shall always be considered a transfer of control.

(2) In other situations a controlling interest shall be determined on a case-by-case basis considering the distribution
of ownership, and the relationships of the owners, including family relationships.

(b) Form required_(1) Assignment.

(i) FCC Form 490 shall be filed to assign a license or permit.

(ii) In the case of involuntary assignment, FCC Form 490 shall be filed within 30 days of the event causing the assignment.

(2) 

Transfer of control.

 (i) FCC Form 490 shall be submitted in order to transfer control of a corporation holding a license or permit.

(ii) In the case of involuntary transfer of control, FCC Form 490 shall be filed within 30 days of the event causing the
transfer.

(3) 

Form 430.

 Whenever an application must be filed under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, the assignee or transferee shall
file FCC Form 430 (``Common Carrier Radio License Qualification Report'') unless an accurate report is on file with
the Commission.

(4) 

Notification of completion.

 The Commission shall be notified by letter of the date of completion of the assignment or transfer of control.

(5) If the transfer of control of a license is approved, the new licensee is held to the original build-out requirement
of  24.103.

(c) In acting upon applications for transfer of control or assignment, the Commission will not consider whether the
public interest, convenience, and necessity might be served by the transfer or assignment of the authorization to
a person other than the proposed transferee or assignee.

(d) [Reserved]

[Reserved].



 24.443 

Extension of time to complete construction.



(a) If construction is not completed within the time period set forth in  24.103, the authorization will automatically
expire. Before the period for construction expires an application for an extension of time to complete construction
(FCC Form 489) may be filed. See paragraph (b) of this section. Within 30 days after the authorization expires an application
for reinstatement may be filed on FCC Form 489.

(b) An application for extension of time to complete construction may be made on FCC Form 489. Extension of time requests
must be filed prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be granted only if the licensee shows
that the failure to complete construction is due to causes beyond his control. An application for modification of
an authorization (under construction) does not extend the initial construction period. If additional time to construct
is required, an FCC Form 489 must be submitted.



 24.444 

Termination of authorization.



(a) (1) All authorizations shall terminate on the date specified on the authorization or on the date specified by these
rules, unless a timely application for renewal has been filed.

(2) If no application for renewal has been made before the authorization's expiration date, a late application for
renewal will only be considered if it is filed within 30 days of the expiration date and shows that the failure to file
a timely application was due to causes beyond the applicant's control. During this 30 day period reinstatement applications
must be filed on FCC Form 489. Service to subscribers need not be suspended while a late filed renewal application is
pending, but such service shall be without prejudice to Commission action on the renewal application and any related
sanctions. See also  24.16 (Criteria for Comparative Renewal Proceedings).

(b) Special Temporary Authority. A special temporary authorization shall automatically terminate upon failure
to comply with the conditions in the authorization.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission adopted an order applying to GTE Corporation the same regulatory framework of Open Network Architecture
(ONA) requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards that apply to the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) for GTE's
participation in the enhanced services market. Under this order, GTE will be required to file an ONA plan within nine
months of the release of this order, file federal and state ONA tariffs three months later, and implement ONA requirements
and nondiscrimination safeguards fifteen months from the release of this order. The Commission stated that the public
interest benefits of applying these measures to GTE amply justify its taking the next logical step toward an overall
environment that will foster a fully competitive market for the provision of enhanced services to the American public.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



The requirements have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended, 44 U.S.C.   3501-20.
The information collection contained herein is not subject to the clearance provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3507 because
it is imposed on less than nine respondents. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In the NPRM the Commission certified that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 did not apply to this proceeding because
the rule amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities,
as defined by section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The rule changes directly apply only to GTE which is
considered dominant in its field of operation. Neither the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
nor any commenting party challenged the Commission's analysis. The Secretary of the Commission is required to send
a copy of this Report and Order, including the certification, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration in accordance with paragraph 605(b) of the regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96-354,

Summary of Report and Order 



1. This is a summary of the Report and Order in Common Carrier Docket No. 92-256, Application of Open Network Architecture
and Nondiscrimination Safeguards to GTE Corporation, adopted March 8, 1994, and released April 4, 1994 (FCC 94-58).
The full text of the Commission's decision is available for inspection and copying, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m._4:30
p.m., in the FCC Reference Room (room 239), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. The complete text of the Report
and Order may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, ITS, Inc., (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street,
NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. 

2. Over the last eight years, the Commission established a comprehensive regulatory framework of nonstructural
safeguards, including Open Network Architecture (ONA) requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards, to govern
the Bell Operating Companies' (BOCs') participation in the enhanced services marketplace. Under ONA, BOCs are required
to offer unbundled ONA services to enhanced service providers (ESPs). By requiring the BOCs to offer unbundled network
services to ESPs, ONA increases opportunities for enhanced services providers (ESPs) to provide, and customers
to receive, a wide range of enhanced services. The nondiscrimination safeguards consist of Customer Proprietary
Network Information (CPNI) rules, Network Information Disclosure rules, and nondiscrimination reporting requirements.

3. The Commission initially did not require local telephone companies other than the BOCs to comply with ONA requirements
and nondiscrimination safeguards. The Commission stated that it would revisit the issue of applying these requirements
to GTE once initial ONA implementation by the BOCs was completed. After gaining substantial experience with the BOCs,
on December 2, 1992, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to seek comment on its proposal
to apply to GTE the ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards that govern the BOCs' participation in the
enhanced services market (57 FR 62544, Dec. 21, 1992).

4. In the Report and Order adopted March 8, 1994 (FCC 94-58), the Commission decided that it should no longer exempt
GTE from complying with ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards. The Commission concluded that applying
these measures to GTE will extend greater access to the largest non-BOC local telephone company, thus facilitating
the provision of additional information age services and greater price competition to consumers.

5. GTE's primary argument against the imposition of these requirements appeared to be the implementation costs.
The Commission, however, concluded that the benefits of applying these requirements to GTE substantially outweigh
the costs involved based on GTE's estimated implementation costs. The Commission concluded that the implementation
costs are not greatly affected by inclusion of GTE's more dispersed, rural service areas because, according to GTE,
the costs of implementing ONA are primarily fixed costs related to modifying GTE's centralized systems.

6. In addition, the Commission concluded that GTE, by many measures, is one of the largest local telephone companies
in the United States. When compared to the BOCs, GTE ranks second behind BellSouth in total operating revenue, total
gross plant, and the number of employees. While GTE has many service areas that are smaller and more rural than those
of the BOCs, it has more working loops than Southwestern Bell even if GTE study areas with less than 200,000 working
loops are excluded. GTE also serves a number of major urban areas in Florida, California, Hawaii, and Texas, that resemble
BOC service areas. The Commission concluded that consumers in GTE's large service areas would benefit substantially
from an environment that fosters the competitive provision of enhanced services.

7. The Commission also concluded that GTE's voluntary ONA measures, while commendable, fall short of the BOC standards
and cannot achieve the Commission's goals. Specifically, the Commission concluded that GTE's network disclosure
and customer proprietary network information (CPNI) programs lack certain important elements contained in the
BOC's requirements. Also, GTE's voluntary program does not include disclosure of important information that the
BOCs must report. Thus, the Commission required GTE to implement BOC ONA requirements and comply with the BOC nondiscrimination
safeguards.

8. Based on the experience gained in implementing ONA for the BOCs, the Commission was able to streamline this process
for GTE. The Commission referred GTE to the numerous orders in the Computer III and ONA proceedings that provide detailed
review and guidance on how it should implement ONA. The Commission required GTE to comply with the comparably efficient
interconnection requirements and all other ONA requirements imposed in the Computer III and ONA proceedings. The
Commission did not require that GTE detail these measures in the ONA plan it must submit to the Commission as long as
GTE's ONA program follows specific procedures approved for the BOCs and is consistent with requirements set out in
the ONA orders. If GTE wants to request authority to meet the requirements in a different way, it must justify the request
in its ONA plan.

9. GTE is also required to participate in the Information Industry Liaison Committee (IILC) beginning thirty days
after publication of this Order in the 

Federal Register

. GTE also must report to the Commission on its progress on IILC activities as the BOCs are required to do.

10. GTE is required to demonstrate in its ONA plan that its proposed initial offering of ONA services will adequately
meet the needs of enhanced service providers (ESPs) in its service areas. GTE also must comply with the ONA deployment
projection reporting requirements applicable to the BOCs. This information must be filed with GTE's ONA plan nine
months after release of this order. Thereafter, the deployment report must be filed annually with the other annual
reports on July 31 of each year beginning July 31, 1996. GTE will also be subject to all of the annual and semi-annual
ONA reporting requirements that are applicable to the BOCs, and the reports must be filed on July 31 of each year beginning
July 31, 1996. In addition, GTE is required to begin providing the semi-annual tariff report that the BOCs are required
to file. The Commission required GTE to begin providing this report to the Commission on September 30, 1995, and every
six months thereafter.

11. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the nondiscrimination requirements that govern the BOCs' provision
of enhanced services. These nondiscrimination safeguards consist of CPNI rules, network information disclosure
rules, and nondiscrimination reporting requirements. The Commission stated that as a Tier 1 local exchange carrier,
GTE is already fully subject to the cost accounting safeguards adopted in the BOC Safeguards Order.

12. The Commission required GTE to comply with the CPNI requirements established for the BOCs within fifteen months
of the release of this Order. Since GTE may need additional time to implement password ID systems, the Commission allowed
GTE two years from the release of this order to comply with the password ID requirements. GTE must describe in its ONA
plan how it will meet the CPNI requirements and include the CPNI notification letter it proposes to send to its multiline
business customers.

13. GTE is also required to comply with the Commission's Operations Support Systems (OSS) requirements within fifteen
months from the release of this Order. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the network disclosure rules
effective fifteen months from the release of this Order. GTE is not required to detail how it meets these requirements
in its ONA plan as long as GTE's procedures follow specific procedures approved for the BOCs and are consistent with
the Commission's requirements in a specific manner already approved for the BOCs.

14. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the nondiscrimination reporting requirements applicable to
the BOCs. In particular, GTE must file an annual affidavit stating that it does not discriminate in providing ONA services
to competitive ESPs and their customers, including the installation, maintenance, and quality of such services.
The annual affidavit must be signed by the officer principally responsible for ONA service quality, installation,
and maintenance. GTE is also required to file quarterly installation and maintenance reports using the reporting
categories adopted for BOC reports unless GTE proposes and the Commission approves a different format for its quarterly
report in GTE's ONA plan. GTE's initial installation and maintenance report is to cover the first full calendar quarter
following the implementation date for ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards and thereafter must be
filed quarterly. The report for each calendar quarter is due thirty days after the close of that calendar quarter.
GTE's format should be consistent with the installation and maintenance system reports required of the BOCs and described
in the BOC ONA Reconsideration Order.

GTE may, however, attempt to justify different service categories at a comparable level of detail. The Commission
delegated authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau to review and to act on any requested changes to the reporting
categories.

15. The Commission concluded that the experience it has gained from its lengthy review of the BOCs' initial ONA plans
and tariffs, as well as from the implementation of approved BOC ONA service offerings, will enable it to streamline
the review of GTE's initial ONA service offerings. GTE shall submit an ONA plan within nine months of the release of
this Order and shall file state and federal ONA tariffs for its ONA services within one year of the release of this order.
The Commission required that GTE implement all ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards fifteen months
after the release of this order unless another time period is specified in the order. These requirements include those
that have been developed in the Computer III and Computer III remand proceedings and the ONA orders, as well as any future
requirements that the Commission may establish for the BOCs, unless GTE is specifically exempted. The tariffs will
be subject to the requirements established in the ONA proceeding and the federal tariffs will also be subject to the
pricing and other requirements of CC Docket No. 89-79, relating to the creation of access charge subelements
and cost support requirements for ONA. GTE must amend its initial federal ONA tariff to include any additional requirements
that are adopted so close to the GTE tariff filing date that they cannot be reflected in the initial tariff filing as
soon as possible during the three month public notice period.

16. The Commission described filing dates in this order as being a certain number of months after a particular event.
In such cases the filing or other such date will be the same day of the month as the triggering event, but the specified
number of months later. Months shall be counted beginning with the month after the one in which the triggering event
occurs. Filing dates falling on a weekend or official federal government holiday will be moved to the next business
day.

17. Finally, the Commission adopted the same preemption of state network disclosure requirements for GTE that was
established for the BOCs in the BOC Safeguards Order. The Commission determined that no other modification to the
preemption of state requirements adopted in the BOC Safeguards Order was warranted.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; School Bus Pedestrian Safety Devices

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule, request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a petition for rulemaking from Blue Bird Body Company, this notice amends Standard No. 131, School Bus
Pedestrian Safety Devices, with respect to the flash rate for stop signal arm lamps. Specifically, this notice amends
the standard to remove design restrictive language that acts to prohibit strobe lamps. The agency has determined
that immediate action is in the public interest since school buses are currently being ordered and manufactured with
strobe lamps so that purchasers can comply with the laws of several States and local jurisdictions that require these
types of lamps. The agency is also requesting comments on whether NHTSA should make permanent its amendment of the
flash rate requirement.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background



On May 3, 1991, NHTSA published a final rule establishing a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) requiring
each new school bus to be equipped with a stop signal arm. (56 FR 20363). A stop signal arm is a device patterned after
a conventional ``STOP'' sign and attached to the driver's side of a school bus. When the school bus stops, the stop signal
arm automatically extends outward from the bus. Its purpose is to alert motorists that a school bus is stopping or has
stopped. The standard specifies requirements about the stop signal arm's appearance, size, conspicuity, operation
and location.

To enhance the conspicuity of a stop signal arm, Standard No. 131 specifies that the device must be either reflectorized
or be illuminated with flashing lamps. If flashing lamps are used to comply with the Standard, they must comply with
the requirements for color, flash rate, vibration, moisture, dust, corrosion, photometry, and warpage, as set forth
in S6.2 of the Standard. In the preamble to the final rule, the agency stated that the tests for flash rate were patterned
after the tests in the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE's) Recommended Practice, J1054, Warning Lamp Alternating
Flashers (January 1977). Specifically, S6.2.2 of the final rule states:




The lamps on each side of the stop signal arm, when operated at the manufacturer's design load, shall flash at a rate
of 60-120 flashes per minute with a current ``on'' time of 50 percent.




NHTSA received a petition for reconsideration of the May 1991 final rule from Epicor Industries, a manufacturer of
turn signals, hazard warnings and alternating flashers. It requested that the agency change the requirements for
the flash rate for stop signal arm lamps under S6.2.2 to conform with the most recent version of SAE J1054, ``Warning
Lamp Flashers, (October 1989). The petitioner stated that such an amendment would assure that the lamps on either
side of the stop signal arm would flash alternately and have ``on'' times that meet an accepted requirement and have
proven effective. The previous version of SAE J1054 (January 1977), which was used by NHTSA to develop the final requirements
of S6.2.2, was determined by the SAE to have been incorrectly written.

After reviewing Epicor's petition in light of the modified SAE recommended practice, NHTSA decided to amend S6.2.2
to make the requirement consistent with the most recent SAE Recommended Practice. (57 FR 40131, September 2, 1992).
In that notice, the agency explained its decision to revise S6.2.2 to reflect the most recent language adopted in the
October 1989 version of J1054. The amended version of S6.2.2 states:




S6.2.2 

Flash rate.

 The lamps on each side of the stop signal arm, when operated at the manufacturer's design load, shall flash at a rate
of 60 to 120 flashes per minute with a current ``on'' time of 30 to 75 percent. The total of the percent current ``on''
time for the two terminals shall be between 90 and 110.



II. Petition for Rulemaking



On February 22, 1994, Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) petitioned the agency to amend Standard No. 131 to allow the
use of strobe lamps on stop signal arms. Blue Bird stated that, according to Specialty Manufacturing Company, one
of the largest manufacturers of stop signal arms, approximately 15 percent of the total stop signal arm market (5,000
units) were equipped with strobe lamps in 1992. Citing previous agency notices, Blue Bird stated its belief that NHTSA
had not intended, in issuing the May 1991 final rule, to prohibit the use of strobe lamps on stop signal arms. For instance,
it stated that in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), the agency had solicited comments about whether
the agency should require strobe lamps.

<TEXT>
 

Blue Bird stated its petition was precipitated by a letter that it received from NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance
addressing an apparent non-compliance of school buses manufactured with stop signal arms equipped with strobe lamps.
According to Blue Bird, the apparent non-compliance results from the fact that S6.2.2 sets forth restrictive design
requirements based on the operating characteristics of incandescent lamps instead of more performance-oriented
requirements based on visual effectiveness. The petitioner alleged that the requirement prevents the use of strobe
lamps. Based on these allegations, Blue Bird stated that the apparent noncompliance results from a deficiency in
the Standard and not a deficiency in its school buses. Blue Bird requested that the agency amend S6.2.2 to allow the
use of strobe lamps, stating that this would be in the interests of safety and consistent with the Standard's intent.

Blue Bird also stated that four states (Alaska, New Mexico, Washington, and West Virginia) as well as some local school
districts require stop signal arms to be equipped with strobe lamps. This consideration prompted Blue Bird to request
that this rulemaking take effect immediately, claiming that the production and delivery of school buses with strobe
lamp equipped stop signal arms needs to continue without disruption.



III. Agency's Decision



NHTSA notes that, in establishing the flash rate requirements, it did not intend to prohibit stop signal arms from
being equipped with strobe lamps. Instead, the flash rate requirements were intended to assure the conspicuity of
stop signal arms. The absence of any intent to prohibit strobe lamps is evident from the preambles to the notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) and final rule. In the NPRM, the agency solicited comments about whether the Standard should require
strobe lamps after discussing the potential benefits from them. (55 FR 3618, 3624, February 2, 1990) In the May 1991
final rule, the agency declined to mandate strobe lights on all new school buses, but suggested that they might be beneficial
in areas prone to poor visibility.

NHTSA further notes that the agency has attempted to make Standard No. 131 consistent with the SAE's Recommended Practice
J1133, School Bus Stop Arms, within the parameters of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C.
1381 

et seq.

) As a result, in reviewing Blue Bird's petition, the agency has analyzed the changes made in the July 1989 revision
to J1133, School Bus Stop Arms. The agency notes that the only significant change was one expressly made to accommodate
strobe lamps and had the effect of allowing them to be installed on stop signal arms.

NHTSA has determined that the current requirements, which are based upon incandescent or filament type lamps, cannot
be met by strobe or gaseous discharge lamps. Filament type bulbs do not reach full brilliance until sufficient time
has passed for the electrical current to heat up the filament wire in the light bulb. This is a function of the filament
wire diameter and the supplied voltage which results in a time delay while the filament wire is being heated to produce
light. As a result of the delay, an extended period of time must be specified before a filament light comes to complete
brilliance. In contrast, strobe lamps are gaseous discharge type lamps that do not have a filament that emits light
and thus do not require an extended time period to achieve complete brilliance. Gaseous discharge lamps emit light
by charging a capacitor and discharging the capacitor through an ionized gas. As a result, the current ``on'' time
duration is typically much shorter for a gaseous type lamp than a filament type lamp. Specifically, the relationship
between the amount of time for a filament type bulb to come to full brilliance is a function of filament wire diameter,
voltage, type of filament wire, and the gas surrounding the filament wire. Based on the above considerations, NHTSA
has decided to issue this interim final rule changing the flash rate requirements for stop signal arms to remove design
restrictive language that acts to prohibit strobe lamps. Specifically, the agency is amending S6.2.2 to modify the
requirements addressing the ``current `on' time.'' As a result, School buses manufactured after the date of the interim
final rule's issuance are permitted to be equipped with strobe lamps.

NHTSA notes that without this amendment to permit strobe lamps, school bus manufacturers and users would be violating
the laws of several States and local jurisdictions that require strobe lamps. This amendment will allow manufacturers
to build and school districts to order school buses that comply with State and local laws that require stop signal arms
to be equipped with strobe lamps. The amendment will also alleviate potential compliance problems for manufacturers
that would have to modify their stop signal arms to remove a noncomplying strobe lamp. Comments on this notice should
address whether the amended language for flash rate is appropriate for strobe lamps. 

NHTSA finds that the issuance of this notice without prior opportunity for comment is necessary in view of the compliance
difficulties that are occurring and would continue to occur if the standard were not amended. The agency also finds
for good cause that it is in the public interest to establish an immediate effective date for the amendments made by
this notice. In the absence of an immediate effective date, manufacturers would be unable to both certify compliance
with Standard No. 131 and meet the requirements of some state laws. The amendments impose no new requirements but instead
provide additional flexibility to manufacturers by removing a design restrictive requirement. 



Regulatory Analyses and Notices 



A. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This notice was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking and determined that it is not significant
within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The agency has determined
that the economic effects of the amendment are so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is not required. Since
the amendment imposes no new requirement but simply allows for an alternative design, any cost impacts will be in the
nature of slight, nonquantifiable cost savings. Additional cost savings may be realized since the amendment permits
manufacturers to avoid civil penalties.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this rulemaking on small entities.
Based on this evaluation, I hereby certify that the amendments will not have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Few of the school bus manufacturers qualify as small entities. In addition, manufacturers
of motor vehicles, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units that purchase motor vehicles
will not be significantly affected by the amendments. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been
performed. 



C. Federalism Assessment 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612.
NHTSA has determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. Nevertheless, NHTSA notes that the laws of various local jurisdictions and four States
(Alaska, New Mexico, Washington, and West Virginia) require stop signal arms to be equipped with strobe lamps and
thus would have been preempted without this amendment. 



D. Environmental Impacts 



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human
environment. 



E. Civil Justice Reform 



This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt
or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard.
Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending
or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for species that 
comprise the shallow-water species fishery by vessels using trawl 
gear in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), except directed fishing for 
pollock by vessels using pelagic trawl gear in those portions of 
the GOA that remain open to directed fishing for pollock. This 
action is necessary because the second seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) apportioned
to the shallow-water species fishery in the GOA has been caught. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA 
exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce 
according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is 
governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 
and 672. 



An emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) 
apportioned the Pacific halibut PSC limit for trawl gear into bycatch allowances, and seasonal apportionments thereof,
among 
fishery categories. In accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iii), the 
shallow water-species fishery, which is defined at  672.20(f)(3)(ii)(A), was apportioned 100 metric tons
of Pacific halibut PSC for the second season_March 31, 1994 through June 30, 1994. 

The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined, 
in accordance with  672.20(f)(3)(iv), that vessels participating 
in the trawl shallow-water species fishery in the GOA have 
caught the second seasonal allowance of Pacific halibut PSC apportioned to that fishery. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting

directed fishing for each species and species group that comprise the shallow water species fishery by vessels using
trawl gear in 
the GOA, except directed fishing for pollock by vessels using 
pelagic trawl gear in those portions of the GOA open to directed fishing for pollock. The species and species groups
that comprise the shallow-water species fishery are pollock, Pacific cod, shallow-water flatfish, flathead sole,
Atka mackerel, and ``other species.'' This closure is effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 19, 1994, through 12 noon,
A.l.t., June 30, 1994.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule changes the final compliance date for installing improved (11-parameter digital) flight data recorders
from May 26, 1994, to the next heavy maintenance check, but no later than May 26, 1995, in Stage 2 airplanes subject to
the rules requiring a transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. This change allows carriers more time to take actions necessary
to retrofit Stage 2 airplanes and makes the flight data recorder replacement rule more compatible with the noise transition
requirements without having a significant impact on safety.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History


On March 25, 1987, the FAA promulgated a final rule that requires operators, by May 26, 1994, to install improved (11-parameter
digital) flight data recorders on all airplanes type certificated on or before September 30, 1969, and operated under
part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (52 FR 9622). The final rule,  121.343(c), was issued in response
to a recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board that was based on accident/incident files for
January 1983 to February 1986 that revealed a high failure rate for metal foil flight recorders. The data revealed
that 37 recorders (48 percent) had one or more malfunctioning parameters preceding the accident or incident, preventing
the recording or readout of pertinent data.


Air Transport Association's Petition for Exemption


In August 1991, the Air Transport Association (ATA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption from  121.343(c). The
ATA stated that the compliance date for the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) retrofit was inappropriate when considering
the schedule for either retrofitting airplanes with noise abatement equipment or retiring airplanes in order to
comply with the Stage 3 transition mandated in September 1991 (56 FR 48628, September 25, 1991). The FAA denied the
ATA exemption request, stating that the Stage 3 transition rule did not mandate the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes.
The FAA pointed out that noise abatement equipment was expected to be available for virtually the entire active fleet.
In June 1992, the ATA again requested that the FAA extend the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for its members and similarly
situated operators. In the alternative, the ATA requested that the FAA establish a delayed DFDR retrofit schedule
that coincided with the Stage 3 transition interim compliance dates to avoid having to install new DFDR's on airplanes
that were scheduled to be retired. The ATA asserted that the compliance deadline would require its members to install
DFDR's on Stage 2 airplanes that would be retired within 51/2 years of the May 1994 compliance date to remain in compliance
with the part 91 noise operating rule. The ATA also asserted that this DFDR retrofit requirement for Stage 2 airplanes
would impose substantial costs on them with little perceived benefit.
On January 29, 1993, after considering all the data presented by the ATA and the commenters, the FAA determined that
a grant of exemption was justified and in the public interest. Exemption No. 5593 permits ATA members to operate certain
Stage 2 airplanes equipped with DFDR's that have 6 rather than 11 operational parameters. Operation is allowed subject
to certain conditions and limitations, including the requirement that air carriers submit a list of their Stage 2
aircraft that will be retired by December 31, 1998. On June 30, 1993, the FAA amended Exemption No. 5593 to clarify certain
conditions that were being misinterpreted.

Air Transport Association's Petition for Rulemaking



On November 17, 1993, the ATA submitted a petition for rulemaking to amend  121.343, requesting that the regulation
be amended to require DFDR installation only on airplanes that will remain in the fleet beyond December 31, 1999, with
installation on those aircraft accomplished in phases.

As justification for this proposed change, the ATA stated that, if 10 of its operators were to comply with the retrofit
requirements of  121.343(c) by May 26, 1994, the cost would exceed $29 million. No details were given on how these
costs were estimated.

On February 23, 1994, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (Notice No. 94-4, 59 FR 8570) that detailed
the ATA's request but proposed an amendment to  121.343 that would extend for 1 year the compliance time for DFDR
installation on Stage 2 airplanes that are subject to the Stage 3 transition requirements of part 91.



Discussion of Comments



Four comments, including one from the ATA, were received in response to the NPRM. One comment was submitted in response
to the publication of the ATA petition, before the proposed rule was published. That comment supported the ATA request,
but did not address the rule change that was proposed. Only one operator affected by the rule submitted comments on
the petition or the proposed amendment.



Comment: 

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) states that the FAA should not grant the ATA's request to adopt a phased DFDR
compliance schedule. The ALPA disagrees with the FAA's finding that the chance of an accident happening on one of the
Stage 2 airplanes covered by the rule change is remote.



Response: 

The FAA did not propose to adopt the ATA's requested phased compliance schedule for DFDR installation; the FAA proposed
only to allow a 1-year extension for certain airplanes in the fleet. ALPA did not submit any information to refute the
FAA finding that the chance of an accident occurring on a subject airplane during the 1-year extension is remote.



Comment: 

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) believes that 7 years is sufficient time for the operators to have
complied with the DFDR retrofit requirements and is disappointed that the May 26, 1994, compliance date is being delayed.
``However, because it would be impossible for the industry to complete the retrofit requirements by May 26, 1994,
the NTSB agrees that a maximum 1-year extension for Stage 2 aircraft is the only recourse available to the FAA without
requiring large-scale grounding of transport category airplanes.'' The NTSB also states that operators should
be required to submit a list of airplanes affected by this rule change to FAA headquarters, noting that the ``industry
has failed to comply with a previous FAA requirement for operators to provide an Aircraft Retirement Schedule'' as
mandated in the ATA exemption discussed previously.

Response: 

The FAA appreciates the NTSB's acknowledgement of the ramifications of enforcing the May 26, 1994, compliance date
and stresses that the minimum feasible extension was sought. The proposed rule already requires the submission of
a list of aircraft covered by this extension. In accordance with the NTSB request, the lists will be submitted to the
Flight Standards Service at FAA Headquarters (AFS-200).


With regard to the operator's compliance with the ATA exemption, the FAA notes that not all covered operators have
chosen to take advantage of the exemption; operators that do not choose to use the exemption are not required to submit
retirement schedules. Further, there was some confusion on the part of some operators as to which airplanes were allowed
to appear on an ARS; that confusion has been eliminated after much discussion between the affected operators and the
FAA, and the subsequent issuance of an amended exemption. The FAA is not aware of any operators that have chosen to use
the exemption and failed to submit the required retirement schedule.



Comment: 

The ATA states that, as proposed, the amendment ``may help some U.S. operators,'' but suggests several modifications
to the proposed rule.




 Expand the applicability of the extension to include certain Stage 3 airplanes for which there currently is
no supplemental type certificate or DFDR kit approve for installation. The ATA states that there will be significant
service impacts on the affected operators, and suggests that the operators of these airplanes be required to submit
documentation as to the anticipated STC approval or retrofit kit delivery dates.

The FAA disagrees. The proposed extension was intended to make the DFDR rule more compatible with the Stage 3 transition
rule of part 91 and its first compliance date of December 31, 1994. No Stage 3 airplanes are affected by the transition
rule. Operators have had 7 years' notice in which to plan for DFDR retrofit of Stage 3 airplanes, a fact not changed by
adoption of the Stage 3 transition rules in 1991. Operators that have failed to use the 7 years to plan for Stage 3 DFDR
retrofits cannot now claim a hardship brought on by their own inaction.

The FAA stated to the NPRM that it recognized the economic impact of the effects of the DFDR and Stage 3 transition rules
combined. There is no similar argument to be made for airplanes unaffected by the Stage 3 transition rules, and to date
the FAA has not made any DFDR retrofit exceptions for Stage 3 airplanes.

The ATA does not justify why these operators that failed to act in a timely fashion after adequate notice should be allowed
an extension of the compliance date. Further, the ATA comment does not take into account the safety benefit of DFDR
retrofitted airplanes, or state any public interest in extending the amendment to these operators. Further, the
ATA suggestion includes a requirement for those operators to show only when they anticipate STC or kit approval and
does not mention an installation date.

Finally, the FAA has no reason to expect that the same nonapproved equipment argument could not be made at the time of
the 1995 compliance date as well. Accordingly, no change will be made in the final rule to expand the applicability
of the extension.

 The ATA states that any Aircraft Retirement Schedule (ARS) approved under its exemption should remain valid.
The ATA is concerned about a statement in the NPRM about the FAA's proposed reexamination of the exemption terms.

The FAA has no plans to withdraw the approval of any ARS already submitted and approved. In fact, the FAA is considering
whether the closing date for the submission of an ARS should be extended to allow for reevaluation of fleet plans based
on this amendment. However, the FAA must retain the ability to ensure that the rule and the exemption are not inconsistent
or that their combined or separate effects do not unfairly harm or benefit individual operators subject to them. While
the FAA currently is not aware of any such circumstances, the agency recognizes its continuing obligation to ensure
that such inequities do not exist. No change to the final rule was suggested by this comment.

 The ATA disagrees with the definition of ``heavy maintenance check'' as being any time the aircraft is taken
out of service for 4 or more days. The FAA notes that a normal service check of 1 to 2 days can be extended to 4 days because
discrepancies that are found during the scheduled check require additional time to rectify. It argues that an operator
cannot always foresee the need for such unscheduled maintenance and have the parts or personnel immediately available
to accomplish the DFDR retrofit when such circumstances arise. The ATA proposed that the definition be revised to
``any occasion which an airplane is taken out of service for a planned heavy maintenance check that is 4 days or longer
in duration.''

The FAA agrees that the service requirements of an individual airplane do not always conform to the time initially
allotted for maintenance, and that the definition needs clarification. However, the FAA disagrees with the ATA's
proposed wording since it includes the words ``heavy maintenance check'' within the definition, and, as noted in
the NPRM, that term has no regulatory meaning and is subject to broad interpretation among operators. The concept
the FAA is attempting to convey is one in which the airplane is scheduled to be out of service for 4 or more days, not an
unplanned 4-day period. This provision highlights the FAA's expectation that the retrofit be completed as soon as
possible, and not deferred until some time near the extended compliance date. The term ``heavy maintenance check''
as used in the rule should be thus interpreted. 

 The ATA states that operators should not be required to submit evidence that they have ordered sufficient flight
data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995, compliance date. The ATA does not see the connection between submitting
proof of orders and the FAA's admonition to operators to the take full advantage of the additional compliance time.
In addition, the ATA considers such documentation to be confidential, and suggests that the FAA use ``standard surveillance
practices to ensure a carrier's intent to comply with the rule.'' 

The FAA disagrees. The inclusion of the requirement to submit evidence of equipment ordered is based on FAA experience
with similar requirements and the tendency for covered operators to delay compliance as long as possible. This very
tendency is what leads to routine requests for such extensions. Submission of equipment orders shows good faith on
the part of the operator to comply and avoids later delays based on equipment unavailability. Conversely, FAA surveillance
cannot determine the intent of an operator to comply, much less ensure an operator's intent, as the ATA states. Likewise,
a Flight Standards Information Bulletin telling FAA inspectors to ``survey the operators on the status of their DFDR
installation plans'' would be equally ineffective. It is unrealistic to expect that a survey question from an FAA
inspector to a part 121 operator would ensure that DFDR installation becomes a priority. Submission of the equipment
orders keeps attention focused on compliance and provides proof of plans to comply that is unavailable by any other
means. Accordingly, that provision will remain in the final rule. Finally, the FAA will treat all such information
submitted as proprietary, as it does the planning information submitted under the Stage 3 transition rule.

 


The ATA also responded to the request for specific cost information in the NPRM. The ATA states that it ``did not receive
any specific cost data outlining the cost savings/benefits of the proposed rule'' from its members. It estimates,
however, that 25 percent of the noncomplying fleet will not have to be specially scheduled if the proposed 1-year extension
is made final, and that this estimate represents a savings of $9.8 million to its members. The ATA does not provide any
information on how it arrived at this estimate. 



The Amendment 



The FAA extends the compliance date in  121.343(c) for all Stage 2 airplanes subject to the Stage 3 transition
rule ( 91.801(c)). The amendment requires that the DFDR installation be accomplished at the next heavy maintenance
check, but in no case later than May 26, 1995. A heavy maintenance check is considered any time an airplane is scheduled
to be out of service for 4 or more days. The extension will allow more flexibility in retrofit planning for those operators
that have experienced difficulty in obtaining engineering approval for DFDR retrofit designs, or an inability to
obtain parts and installation services before the May 26, 1994, compliance date. This change may also function to
bring operators past the first interim compliance date of the Stage 3 transition rule, possibly eliminating the necessity
for any airplanes to be DFDR retrofitted before being removed from the fleet for noise compliance purposes, depending
on the individual circumstances of the operator. By its connection to the Stage 3 transition rule, this amendment
does not extend the compliance date for Stage 2 airplanes under 75,000 pounds, since they are not covered by the transition
rule.

This amendment also requires that by June 23, 1994, each operator submit to the FAA (AFS-200) a list of its Stage
2 airplanes that will be covered by this rule change, and evidence (i.e., a binding contract) that the operator has
ordered sufficient flight data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995, DFDR compliance date, either by aircraft
retirement or planned retrofit. As detailed in the disposition of comments section above, this provision is designed
to ensure that operators take full advantage of the time provided by the extension.

This amendment is considered as providing significant economic relief to the industry and is consistent with recent
recommendations from the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission), a Presidential
task force formed in April 1993 to make policy recommendations about the financial health and future competitiveness
of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries.

In light of the Commission's recommendations and the information submitted, the FAA has determined that a persuasive
case has been made concerning the changing conditions and difficulties that operators have encountered in attempting
to meet the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for Stage 2 airplanes subject to the noise transition rule. The FAA does
not anticipate any significant impact on safety from the adoption of this amendment. As detailed in the NPRM, flight
data recorders, regardless of the number of operational parameters they record, have no direct effect on the safe
operation of an airplane. The importance of flight data recorders lies in their ability to reveal the status and operational
parameters of an airplane after it is involved in an accident or other incident. Depending on what is revealed, such
data can be used as the basis for altering the operation of physical characteristics of similar airplanes. Thus, for
the amendment to have a negative impact, one of the airplanes covered by it would have to be involved in an accident in
the additional 1 year, and information essential to the determination of cause must be a part of one of the five additional
parameters recorded on the upgraded DFDR but not on the currently required six-parameter flight data recorders.

The FAA has concluded that the chance of these particular circumstances occurring is remote. Further, the FAA has
sought to limit this possibility by extending the compliance date only for Stage 2 airplanes, some of which are expected
to leave the fleet by December 31, 1994, under the noise transition regulations. By requiring all other airplanes
to comply with the DFDR rule as promulgated in 1987, the FAA seeks to maximize the benefit of DFDR installation.

The FAA stresses that all airplanes covered under the extension must still be equipped with one or more approved flight
data recorders that record those parameters specified in part 121. It is only the upgrade to 11-parameter DFDR's that
is extended for a limited number of airplanes. The FAA also stresses that the relief will have no effect on compliance
with the Stage 3 transition. The extension is not available for Stage 2 airplanes not subject to the Stage 3 transition
rule, i.e., Stage 2 airplanes that weigh less than 75,000 pounds.

The FAA stresses that carriers should not consider the extension as a period of deferred retrofit action. The FAA does
not anticipate granting any further relief from the DFDR requirements for any airplanes beyond that given here. The
DFDR rule was promulgated in 1987 and should have been incorporated into fleet planning by part 121 operators. The
FAA acknowledges that circumstances such as the Stage 3 transition rules require some reconsideration of rule impacts,
and in light of the reported difficulties in obtaining the necessary equipment and support to comply with the DFDR
rule, this extension is an example of the kind of relief that the FAA considers to be justified. To date, no other substantial,
quantifiable data has been p
