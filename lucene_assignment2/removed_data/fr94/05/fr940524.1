DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 


Agricultural Marketing Service










Processed Fruits and Vegetables, Processed Products 
Thereof, and Certain Other Processed Food Products 
Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification1



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would revise the Regulations Governing Inspection and Certification of Processed Fruits and
Vegetables and Certain Other Products by increasing the fees charged for inspection and by adding a section concerning
cancellation of contracts. These amendments are necessary in order to recover, as nearly as practicable, the costs
of performing inspection services under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 

The Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has certified that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Public Law
96-354 (5 U.S.C. 601). 

The proposed rule reflects fee increases needed to recover the costs of services rendered in accordance with the Agricultural
Marketing Act (AMA) of 1946. The inspection, grading and certification program for processed fruits and vegetables
and related products is voluntary. 

The AMA authorizes official inspection, grading, and certification on a user-fee basis, of processed food products
including processed fruits, vegetables, and processed products made from them. The AMA provides that reasonable
fees be collected from the user of the program services to cover as nearly as practicable the costs of services rendered.
This proposal would amend the schedule of fees and charges for inspection, grading, and certification services to
more nearly reflect the costs currently associated with the program. The amendment would include the addition of
the new Section 52.47 pertaining to charges when service is canceled or changed in order to manage the program in the
most cost effective manner. Former  52.47, which was removed, pertained to microbiological and other types
of testing functions which were transferred to the AMS Science Division. 

AMS regularly reviews its programs to determine if fees are adequate. Employee salary and fringe benefits are major
program costs that account for approximately 85 percent of the total operating budget. Two salary increases for Federal
employees, a 3.7 percent pay increase effective January 10, 1993, and a locality pay increase, ranging from 3.09 to
6.52 percent depending upon locality, effective January 8, 1994, have materially affected program costs. Unemployment
insurance, FTS 2000 telecommunications, General Services Administration rent, and other administrative, supervisory,
and program costs have also increased. 

In addition, the Agricultural Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1994 directed AMS to establish a user fee program
to recover the costs associated with agricultural commodities quality standards. In response, the service has implemented
cost-cutting actions (reorganization and/or downsizing of field offices and technical support services) which
reduced obligations by $569,175 from FY-92 to FY-93. Nonetheless, despite these measures, the Agency
has determined that due to the increases in program operating costs, an increase in fees is necessary to meet rising
costs and prevent financial losses. 

Based on the Agency's analysis of increased costs since 1993, AMS proposes to increase the fees relating to such services
as shown in the following table. The table compares current fees and charges with proposed fees and charges for processed
fruit and vegetable inspection as found in 7 CFR 52.42-52.51. For inspection services charged under  52.42,
overtime and holiday work would continue to be charged as provided in that section. For inspection services charged
on a contract basis under section 52.51 overtime work would also continue to be charged as provided in that section.
Unless otherwise provided for by regulation or written agreement between the applicant and the Administrator, the
charges in the schedule of fees as found in  52.42 are:

Regulations and Statements of General Policy Issued Under the Packers and Stockyards Act: Definitions, Industry
Rules, Schedules of Rates and Charges, Proceeds of Sales, Accounts and Records, Trade Practices, Stockyards Services,
Brand Inspection, and Buyers Expenses 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Packers and Stockyards Administration, Agriculture.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Agency is currently reviewing all regulations and statements of general policy issued under the provisions of
the Packers and Stockyards (P&S) Act. Review of 20 regulations and statements of general policy, which have been
identified as Group 1, has been completed. As a result of the review, this document proposes to remove 2 regulations,
amend 1 trade practice regulation, and retain 14 regulations and 3 statements of general policy in their present form.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 42515) on September 15, 1992. Comments were solicited, at that time, concerning the relevance and importance
of each regulation and statement of general policy to today's livestock, meat, and poultry industries, and which
sections should be retained, modified or removed. To complete the review process, the rules covered by the Advance
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking have been divided into three groups and this document relates to those rules identified
as Group l. 


In response to the request for comments in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Agency received a total of
1,419 comments relating to the rules in Group 1. Comments were received from 1,307 individuals not identified as producers
or as members of any organization, 78 individuals identified as livestock producers, 15 livestock producer and trade
associations, 8 animal welfare groups, 3 individuals representing livestock marketing interests, 3 attorneys,
1 association of veterinarians, 1 bank, 2 law enforcement associations, and 1 State Department of Agriculture. 
No comments were received regarding  201.5, which pertains to Agency procedures on posting a stockyard, or
 201.6, concerning Agency deposting procedures. Both of these regulations involve internal procedures taken
by the Agency in posting and deposting stockyards and are merely expository of the explicit statutory requirements
and not necessary for carrying out the P&S Act. Neither provision affects members of the public. Therefore, this
document proposes to remove   201.5 and 201.6. Removal of these sections will not change the current posting
and deposting procedures. 
Two commenters recommended modifications to  201.61(a). That subsection prohibits market agencies selling
on commission from entering into arrangements with dealers and other buyers that would lessen their loyalty to their
consignors or impair their selling services. In addition, the subsection specifically prohibits a market agency
selling on commission from providing clearing services for an independent dealer purchasing livestock from consignments
made to that market agency. Both commenters, a trade association and an agricultural cooperative, recommended deleting
the specific prohibition in  201.61(a) against a market agency selling on commission providing clearing services
to an independent dealer who purchases livestock from the selling agency's consignments. 
P&SA agrees with the recommendations. The purpose of  201.61(a) is to protect the integrity of the relationship
between the consignor and the consignee market agency. Retention of the general prohibition against arrangements
tending to undermine the loyalty of the market agency or to impair the quality of selling services achieves this purpose
without the necessity of specifically prohibiting the furnishing of clearing services by a market agency selling
on commission. P&SA has determined that the loyalty of the market agency is not likely to be impaired by the mere
furnishing of clearing services to buyers, and so proposes to amend  201.61(a) by modifying the last sentence
of the subsection to permit market agencies selling on commission to provide clearing services to independent dealers
that purchase livestock from consignments to such market agencies selling on commission, provided that full disclosure
of the clearing arrangement is noted on the accounting to the consignor. Full disclosure of the clearing arrangement
will protect livestock consignors without unnecessarily restricting purchases from consignments and will allow
market agencies selling on commission greater flexibility in representing the interests of livestock sellers.

Finally, in view of amendments to  201.56(b), published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993, at 58 FR 52884, the proposed modifications to subsection (a) are logically consistent and appropriate.

A review of the following regulations and statements of general policy has been completed and the Agency proposes
to retain each in its present form: 




Sec.


201.1 Meaning of words. 
201.2 Terms defined. 
201.3 Authority. 
201.4 Bylaws, rules and regulations, and requirements of exchanges, associations, or other organizations;
applicability, establishment. 
201.17 Requirements for filing tariffs. 
201.39 Payment to be made to consignor or shipper by market agencies; exceptions. 
201.44 Market agencies to render prompt accounting for purchases on order.
201.45 Market agencies to make records available for inspection by owners, consignors and purchasers. 
201.81 Suspended registrants. 
201.82 Care and promptness in weighing and handling livestock and live poultry. 
201.86 Brand inspection: Application for authorization, registration and filing of schedules, reciprocal
arrangements, and maintenance of identity of consignments. 
201.94 Information as to business; furnishing of by packers, live poultry dealers, stockyards owners, market
agencies, and dealers. 
201.95 Inspection of business records and facilities. 
201.96 Unauthorized disclosure of business information prohibited. 
203.5 Statement with respect to market agencies paying the expenses of livestock buyers. 
203.12 Statement with respect to providing services and facilities at stockyards on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory
basis. 
203.17 Statement of general policy with respect to rates and charges at posted stockyards. 




In the process of reviewing these regulations, it was determined that they were necessary to the efficient and effective
enforcement of the P&S Act and to the orderly conduct of the marketing system. The absence of any of the regulations
would be detrimental to the industry and could result in increased litigation.

Comments received pursuant to the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning   201.17, 201.45,
201.81, 201.95 and 203.17 were generally in support of retaining each in its present form. No comments were received
concerning   201.1, 201.3, 201.39, 201.44, and 203.12. 
Two comments were received concerning modification of  201.2. This regulation defines certain unique terms
used in the P&S Act and regulations. Both comments came from livestock producer associations and recommended
that video and other forms of electronic marketing be defined. All forms of electronic marketing generally operate
as market agencies selling on commission and are subject to all requirements of the P&S Act and regulations relating
to such entities. Therefore, it has been determined that further definition is unnecessary at this time. 
One thousand three hundred and thirty-three (1,333) comments were received concerning  201.82. This regulation
requires reasonable care and prompt handling of livestock and live poultry to prevent excessive shrink, injury,
death or other avoidable loss. Comments were received from 1,306 individuals not identified as producers or as members
of any organization, 8 animal welfare groups, 11 livestock producer and trade associations, 5 livestock producers,
1 individual representing livestock marketing interests, 1 association of veterinarians and 1 State Department
of Agriculture. More than 1,300 comments recommended amending this regulation to prohibit the sale of downed animals
at stockyards, 26 proposed amending it to require stockyards to humanely euthanize downed animals, 1 recommended
that the Agency issue a policy statement with guidelines on care and handling of livestock, 12 supported this regulation
in its present form, 1 opposed placing regulation of care and handling of downed livestock under Agency authority
and another recommended that the regulation be amended to clarify that its purpose is to prevent economic loss to livestock
sellers and not to further animal welfare interests. Ten other comments generally supported broader authority over
the care and handling of livestock. 
The Agency has considered all of the comments concerning  201.82 and determined that concerns about the care
and handling of livestock at stockyards can be addressed more effectively in a separate rulemaking. Therefore, this
document proposes to retain  201.82 in its present form. The Agency will propose an additional rule, which is
currently being drafted, concerning the care and handling of livestock to be published in a separate docket. 
Eighty-five comments were received concerning  201.86. This regulation sets forth procedures for authorizations
to charge and collect fees for inspection of brands. Comments were received from 73 livestock producers, 4 livestock
producer associations, 3 attorneys, 2 individuals not identified as members of any organization, 2 law enforcement
associations, and 1 bank. Eighty-four comments supported the regulation in its present form. One comment expressed
concern that Section 317 of the P&S Act (7 U.S.C. 217a) limits collection of brand inspection fees at stockyards
to livestock originating within the State and recommended  201.86 be amended to allow inspection of all livestock
sold within the State be done in accordance with the State law where the livestock are sold.

This document proposes to retain  201.86 in its present form because neither the P&S Act nor  201.86
of the regulations authorize or restrict the inspection of brands. Section 201.86 provides the mechanism for collecting
fees authorized by the P&S Act for inspecting brands at stockyards. Restrictions on the collection of fees are
imposed by the statute and not the regulation and it is not permissible to change by regulation that which is prohibited
by statute. 
Three comments concerning  201.94 were received from livestock producer associations. This regulation requires
those persons subject to the P&S Act, upon proper request and within a reasonable time, to provide business information
to authorized representatives of the Secretary, in writing or otherwise and under oath. Two comments recommended
the regulation be amended to require that businesses over a certain size be required to provide to the Agency certain
contract and other business information. One comment supported the regulation in its present form. The Agency has
concluded that the current requirements of  201.94, coupled with the provisions of the P&S Act, are adequate
to provide sufficient access, at this time, to business information of larger firms. 
Three comments were received concerning  201.96. This regulation provides assurances to persons under investigation
that their business records will be treated confidentially and employees of the United States cannot make unauthorized
disclosures of those records. Comments were received from a livestock producer association, a trade association,
and an individual representing livestock marketing interests. Two comments recommended amending this regulation
to provide for a penalty. One comment supported the regulation in its present form. Section 10 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, which has been made a part of the P&S Act by incorporation (7 U.S.C. 222), provides penalties for
unauthorized disclosures. In addition, P&SA considers the criminal penalties provided by the Trade Secrets
Act, 18 U.S.C. 205, adequate deterrent to the unauthorized disclosure of business records and, therefore, no changes
are proposed. 
Three comments were received concerning  203.5. This statement of general policy informs market agencies
selling on commission that P&SA regards the payment of business expenses of buyers attending their livestock
sales as violative of the P&S Act. Comments were received from a livestock producer association, a trade association,
and an individual representing livestock marketing interests. Two comments recommended that practices addressed
in this statement be prohibited only when they result in anticompetitive behavior. One comment supported the statement
in its present form. P&SA believes that this statement reflects the correct formulation of its policy toward
such activities and the legal effect of that policy and that, therefore, no changes are appropriate. 
The proposed change in  201.61 does not impose or change any recordkeeping or information collection requirements.
Existing requirements in this regulation have been previously approved by OMB under control number 0590-0001.

As provided by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this proposed amended rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and a statement explaining the reasons for
the certification is set forth in the following paragraph and is being provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of
the Small Business Administration. 
While this proposed amended rule impacts small entities, it will not have a significant economic impact on any entity,
large or small. The primary effect of this rule is to remove restrictions on purchases by dealers from consignments
of a market agency that provides clearing services to that dealer. 
This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by
OMB. 
This amendment does not impose any new paperwork requirement and does not have Federalism implications under the
criteria of E.O. 12612. 
This proposed amendment has been reviewed under E.O. 12778, Civil Justice Reform, and is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This amendment will not preempt State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this amendment. Prior to judicial challenge of the amendment to rule, a party must first be found by the
Secretary to be in violation of the P&S Act and in violation of the accompanying regulation. Second, the party
must appeal that finding and the validity of the regulation to the Secretary in the course of the administrative proceeding.
Only after taking these steps, may the party challenge the regulation in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Proposed Modification of Class D Airspace; Oscoda, MI



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to revoke Class D airspace currently shown for Oscoda, MI. This airspace was corrected from Class
D to Class E2 airspace because there is no operating control tower at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport. No other changes are
being proposed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide an accurate description of controlled airspace
for Oscoda, Michigan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Comments Invited



Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above.
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-AGL-15.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the
specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained
in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Rules Docket, FAA, Great Lakes Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines,
Illinois, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact
with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.



Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-220, 800 Independence Avenue
SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.





The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revoke Class D
airspace at Oscoda, Michigan. The airspace at Oscoda, Michigan was corrected from Class D airspace to Class E2 airspace
because there is no operating control tower at Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport (59 FR 13648; March 23, 1994). The intended
effect of this proposed action is to provide an accurate description of the controlled airspace near Oscoda-Wurtsmith
Airport, Oscoda, Michigan.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; reopening and extension of public comment period on proposed amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of revisions pertaining to a previously proposed amendment to the Utah regulatory program
(hereinafter, the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The revisions
for Utah's proposed rules pertain to coal exploration. Utah proposed the amendment with the intent of streamlining
the Utah program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background on the Utah Program


On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program. General background information
on the Utah program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
of the Utah program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5899). Subsequent actions concerning Utah's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 944.15, 944.16,
and 944.30.


II. Proposed Amendment


By letter dated January 27, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. UT-888). Utah submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provisions of the Utah
Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposed to revise were: Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645-200-100,
scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645-200-200, responsibilities of the Division of
Oil, Gas and Mining concerning (1) notice of intention to conduct minor coal exploration and (2) major coal exploration
permits; Utah Admin. R. 645-201-100, requirements for coal exploration approval; Utah Admin. R. 645-201-200,
notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R. 645-202-100, required documents
for notice of intention to conduct minor coal exploration and major coal exploration permits.
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the February 25, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9152), provided an opportunity for a public hearing or meeting on its substantive adequacy, and invited public
comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. UT-897). Because no one requested a public hearing or meeting,
none was held. The public comment period ended on March 28, 1994.
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns relating to the provisions of the Utah Coal Mining Rules
at Utah Admin. R. 645-202-232, roads and other transportation facilities, and Utah Admin. R. 645-202-235,
disturbance of the hydrologic balance, and provided editorial comments. OSM notified Utah of the concerns by letter
dated April 15, 1994 (administrative record No. UT-915). Utah responded in a letter dated May 10, 1994, by submitting
a revised amendment (administrative record No. UT-921).

Utah proposes revisions to Utah Admin. R. 645-202-232 and Utah Admin. R. 645-202-235, which
are its performance standards for roads and other transportation facilities and protection of the hydrologic balance
for coal exploration operations.

Specifically, Utah proposes several editorial revisions to make the language used in its coal exploration rules
consistent by (1) referring to coal exploration where 250 tons or less of coal is to be removed as a ``notice of intention
to conduct minor coal exploration,'' and (2) deleting those phrases distinguishing either ``within an approved
permit area'' or ``outside an approved permit area'' that showed a relationship between the proposed exploration
and the approved permit area.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-202-232, which provides performance standards pertaining
to roads and other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, by referencing Utah Admin. R. 645-301-527.240
to require that a road damaged by a catastrophic event be repaired as soon as practicable after the damage has occurred.

Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645-202-235, which provides performance standards requiring
that coal exploration be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance, by referencing Utah Admin.
R. 645-301-532, 645-301-742.100 through 742.125, 645-301-744.100 and 744.200,
645-301-751, and 645-301-753 to address water quality and effluent limitations, sediment
control measures, discharge structures, and impoundments.



III. Public Comment Procedures



OSM is reopening the comment period on the proposed Utah program amendment to provide the public an opportunity to
reconsider the adequacy of the proposed amendment in light of the additional revisions submitted. In accordance
with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable
program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Utah program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issuers proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the administrative record.



IV. Procedural Determinations



1. Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act

No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The General Services Administration is proposing a regulation to further define the term 

equivalent level of safety.

 The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 amended the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to require sprinklers or an 

equivalent level of safety,

 in certain types of Federal Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing
units. This regulation establishes certain criteria which alternative approaches must satisfy to be judged equivalent.
These criteria have been selected to provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. General Requirements of the Act


The Fire Administration Authorization Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-522) was signed into law by the President
on October 26, 1992. Section 106, Fire Safety Systems in Federally Assisted Buildings, of Title I_United States Fire
Administration, is commonly referred to as the Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992. This section amends the Fire Prevention
and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) to require sprinklers or an 

equivalent level of safety,

 in certain types of Federal Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing
units. The Act's applicability and requirements are very complex. They are summarized as follows:
In Federal employee office buildings with more than 25 Federal employees that are newly constructed, purchased,
renovated, or leased (with the Government occupying 35,000 sq. ft. or more and some portion on or above the sixth floor):



 Buildings with 6 or more stories must have sprinklers (or an 

equivalent level of safety

) throughout.
 All other buildings must have sprinklers (or an 

equivalent level of safety

) in hazardous areas.



In Federal employee housing:



 New or rebuilt multifamily housing must have sprinklers (or an 

equivalent level of safety

) throughout, and hard wired smoke detectors.
 All other housing requires hard wired smoke detectors on tenant change or no later than October 26, 1995.



In Federally assisted housing:



 New multifamily housing, 4 or more stories above ground level, must have sprinklers and hard wired smoke detectors.
 New multifamily housing in New York City, 4 or more stories above ground level, must have sprinklers (or an 

equivalent level of safety

) and hard wired smoke detectors.
 Rebuilt multifamily property, 4 or more stories above ground level, must comply with the chapter on existing
apartment buildings in National Fire Protection Association Standard 101, 

Life Safety Code



 

.
 All other housing must have hard wired or battery operated smoke detectors.



The requirements of the Act apply to all Federal agencies and all Federally owned and leased buildings in the United
States, except those of the Postal Service and those under the control of the Resolution Trust Corporation.
In addition, there are a number of definitions associated with the Act. The major definitions are summarized below:



 Federal Employee Office Building means any building, owned or leased by the Federal Government, that can be
expected to house at least 25 Federal employees in the course of their employment.
 

Renovated

 means the repairing or reconstructing of 50 percent or more of the current value of a Federal employee office building,
not including the land on which the Federal employee office building is located.
 

Rebuilding

 means the repairing or reconstructing of portions of a multifamily property where the cost of the alterations is 70
percent or more of the replacement cost of the completed multifamily property, not including the land on which the
Federal employee office building is located.
 

Multifamily

 property means a residential building consisting of more than 2 residential units under one roof housing Federal
employees or their dependents or a residential building consisting of more than 4 residential units under one roof
housing other persons.

Housing assistance 

means assistance provided by the Federal Government to be used in connection with the provision of housing, that is
provided in the form of a grant, contract, loan, loan guarantee, cooperative agreement, interest subsidy, insurance,
or direct appropriation; and does not include assistance provided by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; the Federal
Emergency Management Agency; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the single family mortgage insurance
programs under the National Housing Act or the homeownership assistance program under section 235 of such Act; the
National Homeownserhsip Trust; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the affordable housing program
under section 40 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or the Resolution Trust Corporation under the affordable housing
program under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.

 

Hazardous areas 

means those areas in a building referred to as hazardous areas in National Fire Protection Association Standard 101,
known as the 

Life Safety Code



 

, or any successor standard thereto.

 

Smoke detectors 

means single or multiple station, self-contained alarm devices designed to respond to the presence of visible or
invisible particles of combustion, installed in accordance with the National Fire Protection Association Standard
74 or any successor standard thereto.

 

Automatic sprinkler system

 means an electronically supervised, integrated system of piping to which sprinklers are attached in a systematic
pattern, and which, when activated by heat from a fire:

(a) will protect human lives by discharging water over the fire area, in accordance with National Fire Protection
Association Standard 13, 13D, or 13R, whichever is appropriate for the type of building and occupancy being protected,
or any successor standard thereto; and

(b) includes an alarm signaling system with appropriate warning signals (to the extent such alarm systems and warning
signals are required by Federal, State, or local laws or regulations) installed in accordance with the National Fire
Protection Association Standard 72, or any successor standard thereto.




A critical issue regarding implementation of the Act involves the definition and determination of an 

equivalent level of safety. 

The Act defines the term as an alternative design or system (which may include automatic sprinkler systems), based
upon fire protection engineering analysis, which achieves a level of safety equal to or greater than that provided
by automatic sprinkler systems. The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the Act. In addition
to describing the physical characteristics of an automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance
objective for the system. Automatic sprinkler systems installed in compliance with the Act must protect human lives.
Sprinkler systems are generally not designed with this specific objective in mind.

The General Services Administration must issue regulations to further define the term 

equivalent level of safety. 

The Act specifies that, to the extent practicable, these regulations be based upon nationally recognized codes.
This document provides the further definition required by the Act. A general level of safety provided by sprinklers
is established, and a framework for evaluating alternative methodologies for achieving this level is presented.



II. Objectives of the Legislation



Despite the widespread availability of affordable means of preventing fire losses, the United States continues
to have one of the highest per capita fire death rates in the industrialized world. Fire is the fourth largest accidental
killer in the United States, claiming at least 5,500 lives annually and injuring an additional 30,000 individuals.
The fire vulnerability of office buildings and residential housing units can be reduced through strong fire safety
measures. It is essential for the protection of life and property that effective technology be employed in detecting,
containing and suppressing fires. When properly installed and maintained, automatic sprinklers and smoke detectors
provide effective safeguards against loss of life and property from fire. According to the National Fire Protection
Association, there is no record of a multiple death fire (involving the loss of three of more people) in a building with
a fully operational sprinkler system. The Federal Government, in addition to increasing the protection provided
its own employees and individuals living in federally subsidized housing, can set an example in the area of fire safety
and, by its own actions, encourage the private sector to use technology that has been proven to save lives.

The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 was created to serve as a model for local jurisdictions where the Congress believed
not enough was being done to promote and provide for the fire safety of citizens. The evidence for the Congressional
concern is clear. According to National Fire Protection Association data, there are about 30,000 fire departments
in the country, yet according to the National Fire Sprinkler Association, only 7 states and 34 local jurisdictions
have sprinkler requirements that affect existing buildings. These ordinances have exclusions, applying to only
specific occupancies. Most of them exclude residential occupancies, the occupancy where most fire deaths occur.
The Federal government chose to lead by example without imposing requirements on the states and local communities.

Throughout hearings on the Act, many groups testified that sprinklers were not the only system component necessary
for fire safety in buildings. In addition, Congress did not want the legislation to inhibit the development of new
technology. They recognized the need to have legislation that proactively addressed protection of life from fire.
Therefore, the law does not simply mandate the installation of sprinklers. Congress specified certain life safety
objectives to be achieved by the sprinkler systems. In addition, an equivalency clause was provided to allow for the
use of alternatives which satisfied the identified life safety objectives.



III. Development of an Equivalent Level of Safety Concept 



A. General Issues



The General Services Administration, in cooperation with the United States Fire Administration, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Defense, is required to issue regulations further defining the
term equivalent level of safety. In developing the regulations, GSA has held meetings with a working group composed
of representatives from the agencies named in the legislation and other affected Federal agencies. The Department
of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the
U.S. Coast Guard were invited to participate because the Act's potential impact on their office space or housing.

Use of automatic sprinklers may be the best approach to providing life safety. Sprinklers respond automatically
to fire, limit fire size, and are also able to sound the alert. In addition to enhancing life safety, sprinklers provide
property protection and limit potential business interruption. Sprinklers can significantly reduce the hazard
which firefighters must face in combating a fire. The cost effectiveness of sprinklers for new construction cannot
be overstated. Sprinkler protection can be added with minimal impact on overall project cost while significantly
improving the level of fire safety. In recognition of the many benefits and relatively low cost of sprinkler protection,
the General Services Administration has instituted a policy of providing sprinklers in new construction.
The issue of providing sprinkler protection in existing buildings is not as clear cut. Typically, the cost of providing
protection is higher in existing buildings. It may not be possible to provide complete sprinkler protection due to
existing physical conditions or competing requirements (e.g., historic preservation laws). The decision to provide
sprinkler protection must be part of an integrated fire protection strategy. Existing building systems and applicable
requirements must be considered in developing the strategy. Most model codes provide an equivalency concept which
allows for use of alternative approaches or systems. This concept is provided in recognition of the fact that compliance
with one prescribed solution may not be the best alternative in every case.
These alternative systems, methods, or devices achieve a reasonable level of protection and meet the intent of the
specific code requirement. Alternative methods for limiting fire effects which might be considered include using
fire-rated enclosing barriers, low flame spread interior finish materials, low heat release rate furnishings,
and low ignition propensity materials. In evaluating alternatives, consideration needs to be given to the reliability
of the proposed approach the life of a structure. Enforcement and maintenance practices will vary significantly
depending on the use (office, residence, store, factory, etc.).


B. Working Group Discussions


On July 14, 1993, the working group met with representatives from both the public and private sectors. The interests
of trade associations, State Fire Marshals, fire chiefs, consulting engineering firms, building owners, academia,
and research were presented at the meeting. Based on this meeting, the working group identified a number of issues
important for consideration in developing the regulations.
From these issues, the working group identified four central concerns. Should the regulation address equivalency
to sprinklers or to the level of safety provided by sprinklers? The group agreed that sprinklers provide a unique combination
of fire detection and suppression, and that no current system could be considered equivalent. However, sprinklers
provide a level of safety, especially life safety, which can be provided through the use of other systems in various
combinations. Such other system combinations may include sprinklers. Should the regulation describe a method of
analysis to determine equivalency or the result needed to be equivalent? GSA had originally drafted a proposed analysis
method. This raised more questions than it answered. The group agreed that the regulation should address the endpoint,
or a performance objective which must be satisfied to be equivalent. Are there significant differences between office
and housing occupancies which need to be considered? Reaction time is the significant difference between these two
occupancy groups. Reaction time must be emphasized in any analysis of equivalency in housing. An occupant's ability
to react to a fire and evacuate from the area exposed to fire effects can be influenced by a number of factors including
physical ability, mental status, age, and training. Should the regulation have a height threshold, specifically
should it not apply to high rise buildings? This question was the most difficult for the group to deal with and a consensus
was never reached. The group was divided between two opposing points of view. One portion of the group believed that
the fire safety problems inherent in high rise buildings could only be addressed through complete sprinkler protection.
The Act was intended to require sprinklers in high rise buildings. Therefore, the regulation should place a maximum
height limit on the applicability of the equivalent level of safety provision. The opposing view held that no height
threshold was necessary. Any analysis, required as part of the equivalent level of safety regulation, should address
the fire safety issues associated with protection of high rise buildings. In high rise buildings, automatic detection
and suppression are vital components of a fire protection strategy. Fire protection strategies developed for high
rise buildings under the provision would include some level of sprinkler protection.
The legislation gives the General Services Administration the responsibility to develop the regulation defining
an equivalent level of safety. GSA believes that the law is clear requiring high rise (6 or more stories) Federal Employee
Office Buildings to have sprinklers, or an equivalent level of safety. The Congressional intent for an equivalency
option was recently reinforced by the passage of an amendment to the original legislation providing an equivalency
option in Federally assisted housing in New York City. Finally, the model codes support the use of equivalency concepts
especially in existing buildings. For these reasons, GSA believes the regulation should not have specific thresholds.
Comments on this subject are requested; any comments should include supporting rationale.


C. Equivalent Level of Safety Analysis


The working group identified and discussed a number of critical factors in developing a life safety equivalency analysis.
Rate of fire growth is controlled by the type and location of combustible items, the layout of the compartment, the
materials used in construction of the space, openings and ventilation, and suppression capability. Detection time,
occupant notification, occupant reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress are important considerations
in evaluating egress time. Finally, the life safety equivalency analysis must be conducted by a person familiar with
fire dynamics, building construction, hazard assessment, and human behavior. As a minimum, this person should have
a bachelor of science degree in engineering.
In order to evaluate whether or not a life safety equivalency has been achieved, the building systems must be defined,
reasonable worst case scenarios developed, maximum probable loss estimated, time required for the space to become
hazardous calculated, and time required for egress determined. The proposed regulation establishes a general measure
of building fire safety performance. Building environmental conditions are specified to ensure the life safety
of building occupants outside the room of fire origin. The specified environmental conditions should be applicable
whether or not the evaluation is conducted for the entire building or for just the hazardous areas. In the latter case,
the room of origin would be the hazardous area while any room could be a room of origin in the entire building scenario.

<TEXT>
 


A functioning sprinkler system should activate prior to the onset of flashover. Flashover is a phenomena that occurs
in many building fires. In the initial (preflashover) stages, fire development is controlled by the amount, type,
and location of combustible materials in the area and the speed with which it spreads. As the fire develops, however,
the hot smoke and fire gases accumulate at the ceiling, heating all of the un-ignited materials in the room. The hot
ceiling gases radiate energy onto the burning fuel causing it to burn faster. As the fire grows, the available air cannot
support the combustion of all of the fuel that is produced. The unburned fuel collects in the smoke layer; the smoke
normally blackens at this time. When this combination of events reaches a temperature of about 550 to 600 
 C (1000 to 1100 
 F), the radiant heat from the hot gas layer will quickly ignite all of the exposed combustible material. Frequently
any combustible gases accumulated in the smoke layer will find air and burn out at this time. When this rapid ignition
of combustible material or gases occurs, the fire often violently erupts from the room of origin spouting flame, hot
fuel laden gases, and toxic smoke into adjacent spaces. This transition is called flashover, and a fire that has undergone
this transition is called a flashed over fire.


Sprinklers would provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act by controlling the spread of fire and its effects
beyond the room of origin. Alternative methods which provide equivalent levels of life safety must prevent the spread
of the fire and its affects beyond the room of fire origin. A typical room fire will not pose a hazard to the rest of the
building until flashover. Smoldering fires can have significant life safety impact beyond the room of origin. However,
a typical sprinkler system would not activate in response to a smoldering fire. Therefore, the sprinkler system would
have little or no impact on life safety in the smoldering fire.


To achieve the level of safety prescribed in the Act, the office building or housing unit must be designed, constructed,
and maintained to prevent flashover in the room of fire origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (50 Btu/sec),
or prevent flames from leaving the room of origin. For the purposes of this regulation, flashover is intended to describe
a fire in which the upper layer temperature in a room reaches approximately 600 
 C (1100 
 F) and the heat flux at floor level exceeds 20 kW/m

2

 (1.8 Btu/ft

2

/sec). As with the prevent flashover criteria, the limitation on maximum heat release rate and the requirement to
keep flames within the room of fire origin are designed to limit the size of the fire. A 1 megawatt fire is approximately
equivalent to a single burning easy chair or two burning 1.8m (6 ft) tall Christmas trees. In a 3.6m (12 ft) by 4.6m (15
ft) gypsum board lined room with a 1.4m (4 ft) wide open doorway, a fire growing proportionally with time will produce
an upper gas temperature of 425 to 480 
 C (800 to 900 
 F) in 300 seconds. The fire heat release rate at 300 seconds would be approximately 1 megawatt assuming a medium
growth rate t-squared fire as referenced in Appendix B of the National Fire Protection Association Standard 72, National
Fire Alarm Code. This fire is about the largest that can occur in such a room without a substantial likelihood of flames
discharging out the room doorway.


For the reasons mentioned previously, the life safety impact of a smoldering fire is not addressed in this regulation.
In addition, this regulation does not attempt to provide guidance in determining acceptable levels of protection
against property loss or business interruption. Finally, this regulation does not attempt to address the issue of
firefighter safety. Thorough prefire planning, required by the Act, will allow firefighters to determine whether
or not to enter a burning building; building occupants do not have a similar choice.



D. Summary




As required by the Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992, this regulation is intended to provide a further definition of the
term equivalent level of safety. The regulation establishes certain criteria which alternative approaches must
satisfy to be judged equivalent. These criteria have been selected to provide the level of life safety prescribed
in the legislation. The impact of the legislation requirements and these criteria on property protection, business
interruption potential, and firefighter safety has not been assessed.


The requirements of the Act and these regulations apply to all Federal agencies and all Federally owned and leased
buildings in the United States, except those of the Postal Service and those under the control of the Resolution Trust
Corporation. The Head of the agency responsible for physical improvements in a facility must judge the acceptability
of any equivalency analysis. This regulation provides guidance in conducting an analysis and judging its acceptability.


The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is a significant regulatory action for the
purposes of Executive Order 12866.

Background.



(a) The Fire Authorization Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-522) was signed into law by the President on October 26,
1992. Section 106, Fire Safety Systems in Federally Assisted Buildings, of Title I_United States Fire Administration,
is commonly referred to as the Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992. This section amends the Fire Prevention and Control
Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) to require sprinklers or an equivalent level of safety, in certain types of Federal
Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing units.

(b) The definition of an automatic sprinkler system is unique to the Act. In addition to describing the physical characteristic
of an automatic sprinkler system, the definition sets a performance objective for the system. Automatic sprinkler
systems installed in compliance with the Act must protect human lives. A functioning sprinkler system should activate
prior to the onset of flashover. Sprinklers would provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act by controlling
the spread of fire and its effects beyond the room of origin.

(c) This regulation establishes a general measure of building fire safety performance. To achieve the level of life
safety proscribed in the Act, the structure under consideration must be designed, constructed, and maintained to
minimize the impact of fire. Building environmental conditions are specified in this regulation to ensure the life
safety of building occupants outside the room of fire origin. They should be applicable independent of whether or
not the evaluation is being conducted for the entire building or for just the hazardous areas. In the latter case, the
room of origin would be the hazardous area while any room could be a room of origin in the entire building scenario.

(d) The equivalent level of safety regulation does not address property protection, business interruption potential,
or firefighter safety. Thorough prefire planning will allow firefighters to choose whether or not to enter a burning
building; building occupants do not have a similar option.



 101-6.602

Application.



The requirements of the Act and these regulations apply to all Federal agencies and all Federally owned and leased
buildings in the United States, except those of the Postal Service and those under the control of the Resolution Trust
Corporation.



 101-6.603

Definitions.



(a) Qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual with a knowledge and understanding of fire dynamics
meeting one of the following criteria:

(1) An engineer having a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science degree in Fire Protection Engineering from an accredited
university engineering program, plus a minimum of two (2) years work experience in fire protection engineering,

(2) A professional engineer (P.E.) registered in Fire Protection Engineering, or


(3) A professional engineer (P.E.) registered in a related engineering discipline and holding Member grade status
in the international Society of Fire Protection Engineers.

(b) Flashover means fire conditions in a room where the upper gas layer temperature reaches 600 
 C (1100 
 F) and the heat flux at floor level exceeds 20 kWm2 (1.8 Btu/ft2/sec.).

(c) Reasonable worst case fire scenario means a combination of an ignition source, fuel items, and a building location
likely to produce a fire which would have a significant adverse impact on the building and its occupants.

 101-6.604

Requirements.


(a) The equivalent level of life safety evaluation is to be performed by a qualified fire protection engineer. The
engineer conducting the analysis must have a thorough understanding of the principles of physics and chemistry governing
fire growth, spread, and suppression. The analysis should include a narrative discussion of the features of the building
structure, function, operation support systems and occupant activities which impact fire protection and lifesafety.
Each analysis should describe potential reasonable worst case fire scenarios and their impact on the building occupants
and structure. Specific issues which must be addressed include rate of fire growth, type and location of fuel lines,
space layout, building construction, openings and ventilation, suppression capability, detection time, occupant
notification, occupant reaction time, occupant mobility, and means of egress.
(b) To be acceptable, the analysis must indicate that the combination of features used to achieve equivalency will
prevent flashover in the room of fire origin, limit fire size to no more than 1 megawatt (950 Btu/sec), or prevent flames
from leaving the room of origin. A 1 megawatt fire is approximately equivalent to a burning easy chair or two burning
1.8 m (6 ft) tall Christmas trees. Analytical and empirical tools, including fire models and grading schedules such
as the Fire Safety Evaluation System, should be used to support the life safety equivalency evaluation. If fire modeling
is used as part of an analysis, an assessment of the predicative capabilities of the fire models must be included. This
assessment should be conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Guide
for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Fire Models (ASTM E 1355).


 101-6.605

Responsibility.


The Head of the agency responsible for physical improvements in the facility or providing Federal assistance or a
designated representative will determine the acceptability of each equivalent level of safety analysis. The determination
of acceptability must include a review of the fire protection engineer's qualifications, the appropriateness of
the fire scenarios for the facility, and the reasonableness of the assumed maximum probable loss.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Rewrite




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the report of the National Performance Review (NPR), the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy
has established a Board of Directors comprised of senior level individuals from the Executive Branch to implement
the recommendation pertaining to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The underlying objective of the recommendation
is to convert the FAR from rigid rules to guiding principles.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which, among other things, required the Administration
to simplify the procurement process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles. According
to the report, the FAR, the government's principal set of procurement regulations, is too process oriented, changes
too often, minimizes discretion of procurement professionals, and stifles innovation. The report tasks the Administration
to develop a plan which includes goals, resources and milestones to rewrite the FAR to move from a system of rigid rules
to guiding principles, promote decision making at the lowest level, eliminate unnecessary regulatory requirements,
and facilitate innovative contracting.




As a first step, the Board has drafted a set of core guiding principles intended to define and guide the Government's
general vision and goals for the Federal acquisition process. It is anticipated that, when approved by the Board,
this set of principles will be issued as a policy statement by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. These principles
and the accompanying discussion will be used by the rewrite teams as parts of the FAR are rewritten. As a parallel action,
drafting principles are being formulated which will provide the rewrite team with the methodology by which each part
will be restructured to accommodate the NPR recommendation. These drafting principles will be published for comment
in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice.

The Board requests comments on the following set of core guiding principles and the accompanying discussion. The
Board also requests comment on whether the statement of the principles should be included in a preface to the FAR, one
part to the FAR or merely referenced in the FAR.




Acquisition Guiding Principles





The Acquisition Team includes the customer and the technical, supply, procurement, and vendor communities.


The Vision for the Federal Acquisition System is to deliver, on a timely basis, the best value product or service to
the customer, while maintaining the public's trust.

The Goals of the Acquisition System are to meet the VISION by balancing the interests below:

 Satisfying the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service;


 Minimizing administrative operating costs;


 Conducting business with integrity, fairness, and openness;


 Using commercial products and services in preference to government-unique specifications;


 Using vendors that have demonstrated by past performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to
perform; and


 Fulfilling public policy.


The Role of each member of the Acquisition Team is to exercise personal initiative and sound business judgment in providing
the best value product or service to meet the customer's needs. The system will empower the Team to fulfill its role.

The Success of the Acquisition System will be measured by:


 The level of customer satisfaction;

<TEXT>
 

 Reduced costs of and time consumed by the acquisition process; and

 The degree to which public policy is achieved.



Discussion on Acquisition Guiding Principles



The Acquisition Guiding Principles represent a concise statement designed to be user-friendly for the entire acquisition
community. In order to illuminate the meaning of the terms and phrases used, the following discussion of the Acquisition
Team, Vision, and Goals is provided. The framework for the acquisition system includes the Acquisition Guiding Principles
and the supporting policies and procedures provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). 



Acquisition Team



The purpose of defining the Acquisition Team in the Acquisition Guiding Principles is to ensure that participants
in the Acquisition System are identified_beginning with the customer and ending with the vendor of the supply or service.
By identifying the team members in this manner, teamwork, unity of purpose and open communications between the members
of the Team in sharing the vision and achieving the goals of the Acquisition System is encouraged. Individual team
members will participate in the acquisition process at the appropriate time. 



Vision



Best value must be defined from a broad perspective and is achieved through the balanced application of the acquisition
goals. All participants in the System are responsible for making acquisition decisions that appropriately balance
the goals, resulting in a system which works better and costs less. 



Goals



Satisfying the customer in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness of the delivered product or service. 

While there is a wide variety of customers of the Acquisition System, the principal customers of the System include
the users and line managers of the products or services provided by the System, as well as the American taxpayer. 

The Federal Acquisition System must be responsive and adaptive to customer needs, concerns, and feedback. Implementation
of Acquisition System policies and procedures, as well as considerations of timeliness, quality and cost at each
level in the process must take into account the perspective of the user of the product or service. 

The Acquisition System must perform in a timely, high quality and cost effective manner. 

All members of the Acquisition Team are encouraged to employ planning as an integral part of the overall process of
acquiring products or services. Although advance planning is desirable, each member of the Team must be flexible
in order to accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs. Planning is a tool for accomplishment of tasks, and
application of its disciplines should be commensurate with the size and nature of a given task.



Minimizing Administrative Operating Costs



In order to ensure that maximum efficiency is obtained, rules, regulations and policies should be promulgated only
when their benefits clearly exceed the costs of their development, implementation, administration, and enforcement.
This applies to internal and administrative processes, including reviews, and to rules and procedures applied to
the vendor community. 

The Acquisition System must provide uniformity where it contributes to efficiency or where fairness or predictability
is essential. The System should also, however, encourage innovation, and local adaptation where uniformity is not
essential. 



Conducting Business With Integrity, Fairness, Openness



An essential consideration in every aspect of the Acquisition System is maintaining the public's trust. Not only
must the Acquisition System have integrity, but the actions of each member of the Acquisition Team must reflect that
integrity. Accordingly, each member of the Acquisition Team is responsible and accountable for the wise use of public
resources as well as for acting in a manner which maintains the public's trust. The foundation of integrity within
the Acquisition System is a competent, experienced and well-trained, professional workforce. 

To achieve efficient operations the Acquisition System must shift its focus from ``risk avoidance'' to one of ``risk
management.'' The cost to the taxpayer of attempting to eliminate all risk is prohibitive. The Executive Branch will
accept and manage the risk associated with empowering local procurement officials to take independent action based
on their professional judgment. 



Using Commercial Products and Services in Preference to Unique Specifications 



The government must not hesitate to communicate with the commercial sector, as early as possible in the acquisition
cycle to help the government determine the capabilities available in the commercial marketplace. In satisfying
its needs the government will rely on commercial products and services utilizing commercial standards and practices
in preference to unique government specifications. 



Using Vendors That Have Demonstrated by Past Performance or Who Demonstrate a Current Superior Ability to Perform



When selecting vendors to provide products or perform services the government will use vendors that demonstrate
a superior ability to perform. 



Fulfilling Public Policy



The Acquisition System must support the attainment of public policy goals adopted by the Congress and the President.
In attaining these goals, and in its overall operations, the process shall ensure the efficient use of public resources.




Role of the Acquisition Team



The authority to make decisions and the accountability for the decisions made will be delegated to the lowest level
within the Acquisition System, consistent with law. 

Members of the government Acquisition Team must be empowered to make acquisition decisions within their areas of
responsibility including selection, negotiation and administration of contracts consistent with the Guiding
Principles. In particular, the Contracting Officer must have the authority, to the maximum extent practicable and
consistent with law, to determine the appropriate application of rules, regulations and policies, other than statutes,
to a specific contract. 

To ensure that each member of the Acquisition Team is prepared to perform the functions and duties assigned, the government
is committed to provide training, professional development and other resources necessary for maintaining and improving
the knowledge, skills and abilities of all government participants on the Team, both with regard to their particular
area of responsibility within the System and their role as a Team member. 

The Acquisition System will foster cooperative relationships between the government and its vendors consistent
with its overriding responsibility to the taxpayers.

<DOCTITLE>Cost Accounting Standards Board; Treatment of Gains or Losses Subsequent to Mergers or Business Combinations by
Government Contractors</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Cost Accounting Standards Board, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, OMB.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Cost Accounting Standards Board (CASB), proposes to amend the Cost Accounting
Standards relating to treatment of gains or losses attributable to tangible capital assets subsequent to mergers
or business combinations by government contractors.



To resolve the problems that have been identified in this area, the Board proposes to amend CAS 404, ``Capitalization
of Tangible Assets'' and CAS 409, ``Depreciation of Tangible Capital Assets''. The proposed amendments are based
on an approach involving a ``no step-up, no step-down'' of asset bases and no recognition of gain or loss on a transfer
of assets following a business combination by contractors subject to CAS.

Section 26(g)(1) of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act requires that the Board, prior to the promulgation
of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, publish a report and an ANPRM. This ANPRM addresses the Board's proposal
to amend CAS 404 and CAS 409 to deal with the issue of gains and losses subsequent to a merger or business combination.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


A. Regulatory Process



The Cost Accounting Standards Board's rules and regulations are codified at 48 CFR chapter 99. Section 26(g)(1) of
the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41 U.S.C. 422(g)(1), requires that the Board, prior to the establishment
of any new or revised Cost Accounting Standard, complete a prescribed rulemaking process. This process consists
of the following four steps:

1. Consult with interested persons concerning the advantages, disadvantages and improvements anticipated in the
pricing and administration of government contracts as a result of a proposed Standard.

2. Promulgate an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

3. Promulgate a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.

4. Promulgate a Final Rule. 

This proposal is step two in the four step process.



B. Background and Report



Prior Promulgations



The issues addressed in this proposal were first identified by commenters in response to the Board's request for suggested
agenda topics in November 1990. Subsequently two Staff Discussion Papers (SDP) were issued.

The first, dated August 26, 1991 and titled ``Recognition and Pricing of Changing Asset Values Resulting from Mergers
and Business Combination by Government Contractors,'' raised some broader issues such as the scope of the proposed
project, the basis for any Government claim to gains or losses resulting from a business combination and the likely
economic consequences of a policy that would prohibit revaluation of assets following a merger.

The responses to this SDP were used by the Board as basis for discussing the basic issues involved in this case. As a result
of this discussion, the Board decided to issue a second SDP dealing with a series of questions mostly concerning the
specific procedures needed to deal effectively with the recognition, allocation and recovery of the gain or loss
subsequent to a merger or business combination. The second SDP, titled ``Treatment of Gains or Losses Subsequent
to Mergers or Business Combinations by Government Contractors,'' was issued on November 4, 1993. The responses to
this SDP were of significant assistance to the Board in developing the current ANPRM.



Public Comments



Fifteen sets of public comments were received. Three of these were from government agencies, five from government
contractors, four from trade and professional associations and three from individuals and other commenters. The
comments were most useful to the Board in its decision-making process and, represented a wide spectrum of views on
the various issues that were raised. The SDP included a series of questions dealing with the measurement of the gain
or loss subsequent to a merger or business combination, its allocation between the government and the contractor
and the possible methods of recovery that the government could employ in trying to recover its share of a gain or loss.
In many instances, the responses to these questions indicated that the commenters believed that a comprehensive
and equitable process of allocating gains or losses between the Government and contractors would entail use of complex
and cumbersome procedures that would add significantly to the implementation cost of any Standard that would sanction
revaluation of tangible capital assets subsequent to a merger or business combination. The comments that were received
are discussed below in greater detail, under Section E., Public Comments. The Board and the CASB staff express their
appreciation for the thoughtful and generally constructive responses provided by the commenters.

Benefits



After consideration of all the comments received, the Board believes that amendments to CAS 404, Capitalization
of Tangible Assets, and CAS 409, Depreciation of Tangible Capital Assets, as set forth in this ANPRM will significantly
improve and clarify the implementation of CAS and related procurement regulations in accounting for tangible capital
assets after a merger or business combination. In particular, the Board believes that a clean-cut resolution of this
issue, as proposed in the ANPRM, will clarify the ambiguities that currently exist in this area and thus should lead
at least to some reduction in the present confrontational negotiations and litigation in this area. This point is
of particular significance in the current economic and budgetary environment where further reductions in the defense
budget can be expected to lead to further mergers and business combinations among defense contractors. The Board
believes that potential benefits to the audit, negotiations, and general contract administration processes occurring
from the added clarity and uniformity in the measurement of the cost of depreciation and cost of money subsequent to
a business combination will be substantial and will greatly outweigh any added costs.



Summary of Proposed Amendments



A brief description of the proposed amendments follows:

a. The current subsection 9904.404-50(d) is deleted and is replaced by an amended section that prescribes:

(1) that for Federal Government contract costing purposes tangible capital assets after a business combination
shall retain their net book value recognized prior to the business combination provided that the assets had previously
generated costs that were chargeable to Federal Government contracts subject to CAS.

(2) That the cost of tangible capital assets shall be restated after the business combination at a figure not to exceed
the fair value at the date of the acquisition pursuant to a business combination where the assets prior to the business
combination did not generate costs that were chargeable to Federal Government contracts subject to CAS.

b. A new subparagraph 9904.409-50(j)(5), is added to current subsection 9904.409-50(j). The purpose
of this new subparagraph is to make it clear that the CAS 409 provisions dealing with the recapture of gains and losses
on disposition of tangible capital assets should not apply when assets are transferred subsequent to a business combination.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act



The Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96-511, does not apply to this proposal, and any associated rulemaking,
because this proposal would impose no paperwork burden on offerors, affected contractors and subcontractors, or
members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.





D. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act



The economic impact of this proposal on contractors and subcontractors is expected to be minor. As a result, the Chairman
has determined that this ANPRM will not result in the promulgation of a ``major rule'' under the provisions of Executive
Order 12866, and that a regulatory impact analysis will not be required. Furthermore, this proposal will not have
a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities because small businesses are exempt from the application
of the Cost Accounting Standards. Therefore, this proposed rule does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.



E. Public Comments



This ANPRM was developed taking into account the comments received to the issue raised in the Staff Discussion Paper
made available for public comment on November 4, 1993. The comments have provided valuable input to the Board's rulemaking
process. The comments received and the action taken by the Board are summarized in the paragraphs that follow:



Comment:

 In response to a question on the relationship between CAS and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) most
commenters agreed that the Board should utilize GAAP to the greatest practical extent, but nevertheless, the Board
clearly has the authority to depart from GAAP when deemed necessary to meet the Board's objectives.



Response:

 The Board is in agreement with the comment.



Comment:

 In response to a question as to the level of aggregation of individual asset values that might be used as a basis for establishing
``fair values'' for tangible capital assets, a number of comments pointed out that the current definitions of ``asset
accountability unit'' in 9904.404-30(a)(1) would be an adequate basis for determining the detail required.
They also pointed out that asset groupings are already adequately covered in 9904.409-50(d) and in the relevant
illustrations 9904.409-60(a) (2) and (3).



Response:

 The Board is in agreement with this comment.

Comment: 

A great variety of comments were received in response to a question as to whether the current 9904.409-50(j)(1)
cap on government recovery in the form of accumulated depreciation, should be also applied to gains and losses recognized
subsequent to a revaluation of assets pursuant to a business combination. About half of the commenters believe that
the current cap should be also applied to gains related to assets acquired in the course of a business combination.
A significant number of other commenters believe, however, that no such cap should be applied in these circumstances.
One commenter advocated a modified cap that would recognize the element of inflation in the gain. Another commenter
stressed that the Government should share not only any gains, but also in any losses that may emerge.



Response: 

The Board has considered the merits of a cap adjusted for inflation. However, the actual calculations to establish
such a modified cap seem to require establishment of a fairly complex and possibly cumbersome procedure. 

The Board agrees with the commenter who stated that the Government should participate in losses as well as in gains.



Comment: 

On the question as to whether the cap should be modified to take into account cost of money paid in the past, the views
of commenters were clearly divided. The government commenters believed that there should be some accounting for
past cost of money payments whereas all the other commenters did not think that any modification in the cap was warranted.
However, most commenters recognized, that any attempt to modify the cap for cost of money would be complex and extremely
difficult to compute in practice.



Response: 

The Board agrees that any adequate process that could be developed to modify the current cap on government recovery
for the past payments of cost of money would be complex and difficult to compute.



Comment: 

With respect to the conceptual argument as to who, the contractor or the Government should retain the ``gain'' due
to inflation, there was no clear-cut agreement. In general, the government commenters stated that the government
was entitled to any gain attributable to inflation on account of past cost of money payments. The industry commenters
generally disagreed, although on a conceptual plane there were one or two exceptions.

One industry commenter pointed out, once again, that if the Government wishes to share in the gain, it should be also
willing to share in the losses.

One commenter stated that there should be no attempt to try to implement inflation accounting on a piecemeal basis.
If it is to be done, then asset bases should also be revalued.

However, the overwhelming majority of the commenters indicated that whatever the arguments regarding the merit
of recognizing inflationary gains, in practice the procedures needed to implement such inflationary adjustments
would be so cumbersome and complex as to render the whole system unworkable.



Response: 

The Board agrees with the commenters who state that the calculation of any inflationary adjustment would be a cumbersome
and complex procedure.



Comment: 

When responding to the request in the SDP for suggestions regarding basis for allocation of gains or losses between
government and contractors, virtually all of the commenters recognized the construction of an index or some other
factor to reflect the historical usage of assets on CAS-covered work as contrasted with other work would be impractical
and the costs involved would clearly exceed any possible benefits.

Three comments suggested that, in any event, it would be contrary to the current CAS provisions to try to allocate the
gain or loss on the basis of historical usage. They point out that current CAS 409, 415, and 416, in effect, use the current
activity as the base for allocating adjustments related to the past cost measurements. Thus, these commenters maintain
that a charge against the current period costs is all that is required. 

Three other commenters suggested that it may be possible to use a form of advance agreement that would establish, in
conjunction with incurred cost settlements or submission, the ratio of CAS/non-CAS work at the indirect cost pool
level.

It was also pointed out that no attempts at allocation should be undertaken when the contractor is essentially all
CAS covered or all non-CAS covered, e.g., 85% or more in either category.



Response: 

The Board agrees with the commenters that it would be difficult to develop an equitable and reliable, as well as, economical
basis for establishing the past usage of assets in CAS work as contrasted with non-CAS work.



Comment: 

Most commenters indicated that gains or losses attributable to misestimating of the residual value of assets transferred
in a business combination should not be treated differently from other gains or losses attributable to assets transferred.

<TEXT>
 

Several commenters pointed out, that in any event, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the amount
of ``misestimated residual value.''
Some commenters also expressed a belief that the question raised is based on a false premise. Residual value is a concept
based on historical cost and enters into the process of determining depreciation costs (an allocation process),
whereas gains or losses based on fair values subsequent to a business combination are derived from current values
(valuation process). Therefore, residual value should not be compared to disposition value.
Nevertheless, a few commenters recognized the significant discrepancy between the original residual value and
the fair value established subsequent to a business combination, may indicate a misestimation in the residual value
which could be interpreted as a CAS non-compliance.


Response: 

The Board appreciates the input of comments who responded to this issue. It notes the comments that indicate that it
may be difficult to separate the consequences of misestimates in residual values from changes in fair values when
assets are transferred in the course of a business combination.


Comment: 

Practically all the commenters recognized that subsequent to a business combination the government may have a clear-cut
claim against the seller.
A number of industry comments expressed the belief that the government has a valid claim only to the extent that there
have been erroneous estimates of depreciation in the past.
A significant number of comments did recognize, however, that subsequent to a business combination the relationship
between the government and the seller may dissolve. In those cases, it was suggested that appropriate notation agreements
should be negotiated with the buyer. The government comments, in particular, stressed that if the claim cannot be
successfully pursued against the seller, then there must be alternative ways of pursuing the claim, such as proceeding
against the buyer or trying to collect from the proceeds of the acquisition.


Response: 

The Board notes the comment that the government may have difficulties in pursing to claim against the original owner
of the assets if subsequent to a business combination there is no longer a business relationship between the government
and the seller.


Comment: 

The commenters on the whole, did not support the notion that the government should recover its share of gain or loss
subsequent to asset revaluation from the buyer. Some comments pointed out that such a gain or loss recovery is a contract
administration issue and not an accounting matter. It was also suggested that the matter might be best dealt with at
the time when novation and advance agreements are negotiated between the government and the contractor.



Repsonse: 

The Board has taken note of the comments received on this topic.



Comment: 

The last issue raised in the SDP concerned the advisability of retaining the original asset base subsequent to the
business combination in view of the complex and costly procedures that would have to be developed to share any gain
or loss, attributable to asset revaluation, between the government and the contractor.

There was a clear divergence of views on this topic between the government commenters and other comments. All the government
responses indicated that assets should be not revalued subsequent to a business combination. All the other comments
expressed the views that such a revaluation should be carried out and recognized for government contract costing
purposes. One industry comment did point out, however, that the assets should not be revaluated if the business combination
takes the form of acquisition of shares rather than assets.

Several commenters pointed out that in any event the apparent conflict between CAS and the Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) should be eliminated. It was also pointed out that the government should be consisted in its application of cost
accounting practices in this area. It should either allow revaluation of assets subsequent to business combinations
and then deal with the resulting gain and loss issues, or adopt practices based on not revaluing assets and limiting
depreciation and gains and losses to historical costs without regard to business combinations. 


Response: 

The Board agrees with the commenters who stated or inferred that in case of asset revaluations subsequent to a business
combination the procedures involved to develop an adequate and equitable method to share the gain or loss between
the government and the contractor would be complex and costly. At the same time, the Board does not agree with those
commenters who maintain that the government is not entitled to any share in the gain or loss subsequent to asset revaluation
because such a gain or loss can only accrue to a party that bears the risk of ownership, i.e., the contractor. The Board
believes that in a business environment where cost-based pricing prevails, which includes an allowance for cost
of money, and long-term contractual relationshps are the norm, the buyer, i.e., the government, has a sound claim
to the benefits that may emerge as the tangible capital asset values increase in response to the interaction of various
market forces. Conversely, the Board also believes that if the government is entitled to the benefits that may emerge
as the asset values increase, it should also be prepared to bear the additional costs when the asset values are decreasing.

Therefore, the Board has concluded that in light of the complexity of the procedures that are needed to deal with the
revaluation of assets and the subsequent sharing of ensuing gains and losses, the most acceptable course to follow
in pursuit of its objectives is to retain the original asset acquisition cost as a base for calculating contract costs
after a business combination or merger has taken place.

(d) Under the ``purchase method'' of accounting for business combinations, tangible capital assets acquired shall
be assigned acquisition costs for Federal Government contract costing purposes as follows: 
(1) Where the assets prior to the business combination generated costs that were chargeable to Federal Government
contracts subject to CAS, the assigned acquisition cost of tangible capital assets after the business combination
shall be their net book value, recognized for Federal Government contract costing purposes, immediately prior to
entering into the business combination. 
(2) Where the assets prior to business combinations did not generate costs that were chargeable to Federal Government
contracts subject to CAS, the assigned acquisition costs of tangible capital assets after the business combinations
shall be a portion of the cost of the acquired company, not to exceed their fair value at date of acquisition. Where the
fair value of identifiable acquired assets less liabilities assumed exceeds the purchase price of the acquired company
in an acquisition under the ``purchase method,'' the value otherwise assignable to tangible capital assets shall
be reduced by a proportionate part of the excess.

Electronic Filing of Tariffs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposal to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee.




 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ICC intends to establish a committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act to develop rules for electronic tariff
filing (ETF). The ICC has requested and received approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish
the Committee. In a notice (First Notice) published April 6, 1994 in the 

Federal Register

, the ICC invited applications and nominations for Committee membership. This Second Notice lists the submitted
applications and nominations, the persons selected, the interests they represent, and a proposed agenda and schedule
for completing the work of the Committee. The public is asked to comment, particularly on the proposed composition
of the Committee and whether all interests are represented. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a previous decision and notice (First Notice) in this proceeding,

1

 the Commission announced its intention to begin development of a comprehensive ETF system through means of a negotiated
rulemaking committee. The Commission concluded that public comments received earlier support development of ETF,
and that use of a rulemaking committee here would be in the public interest as defined in the Negotiated Rulemaking
Act of 1990,  583 (Reg-Neg ACT).

2

 






The comments received in response to the First Notice were generally favorable to the proposal, and a number of persons
have submitted applications or nominations for the Committee. In this notice (Second Notice), we are offering the
public a second chance to comment on our selection of members, and are setting forth the proposed agenda and schedule
for the Committee.

3

 





Background. The First Notice described in detail the subject and scope of the rule to be developed and the issues to
be considered. In brief, the Committee will identify the needs that an ETF system would serve, review the ETF options,
and recommend appropriate technology and regulations.

4

 If the Committee agrees on the rules for an ETF system, we expect to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking containing
those rules. 





We also indicated our willingness to provide administrative support and meeting rooms, to appoint an employee to
represent the agency on the Committee, and, if necessary, to investigate agency hiring of a technical expert to assist
the Committee. The members of the Committee would be expected to pay their own expenses of participating on the Committee.


Committee Membership. Committee membership is generally limited to 25,

5

 and must include at least one person from the Commission. Reg-Neg Act,  585(b). The Committee must also have
members representing all interests that will be significantly affected by the rule. The First Notice requested public
comment as to these interests and solicited applications and nominations for participation on the Committee. Based
on the comments and our own consideration of the issue, we believe that the following interests should be represented
on the Committee: motor, rail, and water common carriers; carrier employees; publishing agents; tariff analysts;
and shippers. Rate bureaus may represent the interests of both publishing agents and carriers. 





A list of those persons who have applied, or been nominated for the Committee, and their affiliations, is attached
as Appendix A. Because more than 25 persons applied or were nominated, we selected those whose scope of representation,
skills, and interest appear to be most appropriate to the needs of the Committee. Where we have selected more than one
person nominated by the same organization, we believe the persons selected have different skills and/or represent
different interests. 

Those who were selected are noted with an asterisk on Appendix A.

 We seek public comment on the proposed composition of the Committee and whether all interests affected by the rule
are represented. Persons believing that the proposed Committee does not adequately represent their interests are
encouraged to apply for membership. Persons submitting applications or nominations after publication of this Second
Notice will have to state the reasons that the persons selected in this notice do not adequately represent the interests
of the person submitting the application or nomination.

Because the Committee's work will require knowledge of technical tariff and electronic data processing matters,
persons applying or being nominated for the Committee should possess these skills (as well as others). Applications
or nominations for membership must include the following: 




(1) The name of the applicant or nominee and a description of the interests such a person shall represent; 

(2) Evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to represent parties related to the interests the person
proposes to represent; 

(3) A written commitment that the applicant or nominee shall actively participate in good faith in the development
of the rule under consideration; and 

(4) The reasons that the persons specified in this Second Notice do not adequately represent the interests of the person
submitting the later application or nominations. 




Proposed Agenda and Schedule. A proposed Agenda and tentative Schedule are attached as Appendix B. 
Environmental Statement 

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy
resources. 




Decided: May 17, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of amendments to fishery management plans; request for comments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this notice that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 30 to
the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), Amendment 27 to the FMP for Groundfish
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, and Amendment 3 to the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands for Secretarial review and is requesting comments from the public. These amendments
would incorporate the provisions of the North Pacific Fisheries Research Plan (Research Plan) into each FMP. The
intended effect of these amendments is to provide a standard application of the Research Plan and associated observer
coverage throughout applicable fisheries. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any FMP or FMP amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) for review and approval,
disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving an FMP or
amendment, immediately publish a notice that the FMP or amendment is available for public review and comment. The
Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in determining whether to approve
the FMP or amendment. 



Amendments 30, 27, and 3 would revise language in the FMPs for GOA groundfish, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area
groundfish, and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands king and Tanner crab, respectively, to reflect the development of
the Research Plan and to indicate that observer requirements under those FMPs are as specified under the Research
Plan. 

The Research Plan was prepared by the Council under section 313 of the Magnuson Act, as amended by section 404 of the
High Seas Driftnet Fisheries Enforcement Act, Public Law 102-582, and is intended to provide an industry-funded
observer program and to promote management, conservation, and scientific understanding of groundfish, halibut,
and crab resources off Alaska. The proposed Research Plan, that was submitted for Secretarial review on March 31,
1994 would: (1) Require that observers be stationed on fishing vessels engaged in the catching, taking, or harvesting
of fish and on U.S. fish processors fishing for or processing species under the authority of the Council, except salmon,
including the Northern Pacific halibut fishery, for the purpose of collecting data necessary for the conservation,
management, and scientific understanding of fisheries under the Council's authority; and (2) establish a system
of fees to pay for the costs of implementing the Research Plan. A proposed rule to implement the Research Plan was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23664); additional details of the Research Plan may be found in the proposed rule. Because Amendments
30, 27, and 3 are non-regulatory in nature, no proposed rule will be published to implement them.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule addresses NIOSH's and the Department of Labor/Mine Safety and Health Administration's (MSHA)
certification requirements for respiratory protective devices. Specifically, the proposal would replace existing
MSHA regulations with new public health regulations, while also upgrading current testing requirements for particulate
filters. 


This action is the first of a series of modules which will, over the next several years, upgrade current respirator
requirements. This modular approach will allow improvements to be implemented on a priority basis as well as facilitate
adaptation to new requirements by the manufacturers and users of respirators. Except for the particulate-filter
requirements, most requirements of existing regulations would be incorporated into the new regulations without
change. The proposed testing requirements for particulate filters would significantly improve the current approach
to evaluating the effectiveness of an air-purifying respirator's filter to remove toxic particulates from the ambient
air, updating existing provisions to be consistent with two decades of advances in respiratory protection technology.

The certification of air-purifying respirators under these proposed requirements would also enable respirator
users to select from a broader range of certified respirators that meet the current performance criteria recommended
by CDC for respiratory devices used in health-care settings for protection against 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

 the infectious agent that causes tuberculosis (TB). 
This Notice also announces an informal public meeting on the proposed rule, as indicated below. 
Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, MSHA is publishing a proposal to remove existing regulations at 30 CFR part 11, which would be made obsolete by a final
rule resulting from this proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Paperwork Reduction Act 


Manufacturers seeking approval of respiratory protective devices would continue to be required to submit applications
for approval, including related drawings, drawing lists, specifications, and descriptions. The paperwork burden
for this application process is identical to that included in existing 30 CFR 11.10, previously approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). 
However, those sections containing information collections are being submitted to OMB for review under section
3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments
on the information collections should direct them to the NIOSH Docket Office and to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs; OMB, New Exectutive Office Building (Room 3208), Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for HHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH.



II. Background 


The existing rules and procedures in 30 CFR Part 11 for approval of respiratory-protective devices, or respirators,
evolved from rules and procedures developed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines (BOM). Until 1972,
the BOM was solely responsible for testing and approving respirators. In 1972, Part 11 was published jointly by the
BOM and NIOSH. This regulation replaced the BOM's rules and procedures, and delineated the responsibilities of the
two agencies. Under this regulation, the BOM evaluated respirator performance, and NIOSH was responsible for administration
of the quality control provisions. The BOM also tested the safety of electrical components of respirators for use
in potentially explosive atmospheres in underground-gassy mines (intrinsic safety) under the requirements of
30 CFR part 18. 
A Memorandum of Understanding, dated May 30, 1972, between the two agencies refined their respective roles, and part
11 was amended in 1973. Under this arrangement, NIOSH undertook primary responsibility for performance testing
of respirators. Although all approvals continued to be issued jointly, the BOM primarily retained only the responsibility
to test for intrinsic safety on the small number of respirators that had electrical components. 
The Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration, MSHA's predecessor agency, was created in 1974, and the responsibilities
of the BOM under part 11 were transferred to that agency. Since MSHA was created in 1978, it has continued to test electrical
components of respirators for intrinsic safety. MSHA has issued separate approvals for respirators meeting the
requirements of 30 CFR part 18. While MSHA currently reviews applications for respirator certifications and has
conducted some product evaluations, laboratory testing, quality assurance, and product audit for certain respirators,
the principal testing and approval activities specified by part 11 are primarily conducted by NIOSH. NIOSH is proposing
to redesignate the requirements for the certification of respiratory-protective devices of part 11 to part 84 of
Title 42 (42 CFR part 84) under this action. 
Following promulgation of 30 CFR part 11 in 1972, NIOSH began conducting research in several areas of respiratory
protection. Concurrently, NIOSH began to receive public input concerning the respirator-certification program.

In December 1977, NIOSH conducted a public meeting to obtain comments on changes needed in 30 CFR part 11. In 1979, a
group of outside consultants conducted a thorough review of the program. The report received from those consultants
was published by NIOSH for further consideration by other interested persons, and a public meeting was held in July
1980 to obtain their comments on the program. In December 1981, the American National Standards Institute Z88 Committee
on Respiratory Protection commented on 30 CFR part 11. In January 1982, the Mine Health Research Advisory Committee
transmitted its recommendations to NIOSH for further changes to the program. Since 1982, NIOSH has solicited and
investigated reports of problems with NIOSH/MSHA-certified respirators with the purpose of obtaining direct public
input into the approval program. 
Investigations, research, comments, and analyses were considered by NIOSH and MSHA in preparation of a proposed
comprehensive revision to the approval requirements. These changes to existing requirements and tests were proposed
as a new 42 CFR part 84, which was published on August 27, 1987 (52 FR 32402). Two public meetings were held to obtain comments
on the proposal (in San Francisco, CA on January 20, 1988, and in Washington, D.C. on January 27-28, 1988). Two
extensions of the public comment period were issued (52 FR 37639 and 53 FR 5595), with it ending on March 28, 1988. Concurrent
with the publication of the proposed part 84, MSHA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 32313) proposing the withdrawal of 30 CFR part 11 upon final publication of 42 CFR part 84. Under that proposal,
MSHA would have retained a consultative role in the approval of respirators used in mining in order to protect the health
and safety of miners, particularly concerning mine rescue and mine emergency respirators. 
During the 7-month comment period following the publication of the proposed part 84, NIOSH received 271 comments
on this comprehensive proposal. Since receiving these comments, NIOSH has been conducting investigations and research
to consider the technical issues addressed in these comments. Delays have been experienced in finalizing a revised
part 84 draft as a result of the number and diversity of the comments received. NIOSH determined that at least four major,
and more than one hundred minor technical and administrative changes to the first comprehensive proposal would be
required to adequately address all the areas of concern. Consequently, NIOSH has reevaluated its intent to develop
and implement a single, comprehensive revision to the existing regulation of part 11. 
Instead, NIOSH intends to promulgate modifications to the existing requirements of 30 CFR part 11 in a series of modules.
There are numerous benefits to utilizing a modular approach to promulgate the anticipated changes to the existing
requirements. Among these are the following considerations: 
1. Improvements can be implemented on a priority basis, assuring that those expected to contribute most to improving
worker protection are implemented first, 
2. Incremental promulgation of improvements should facilitate adaptation to new requirements by the respirator
manufacturer and user communities, minimizing the potential for any disruption in the supply of certified respirators,
and 
3. Public participation in the rulemaking process will be facilitated by proposing important regulatory changes
in individual segments of separate rulemaking.

The anticipated subjects and sequence of the NIOSH rulemaking, according to this modular approach are: 







NIOSH is proposing a limited revision to the existing requirements of 30 CFR part 11 in this first ``module'', requiring
updated particulate filter tests. These proposed changes would produce significant improvements in the level of
protection provided to the wearers of the respiratory protective devices and would enable users to easily discern
the level of protection that can be expected when using a particular respirator, with little impact on the certification
process. NIOSH estimates that these changes to the particulate filter requirements will affect approximately 80%
of all respirators currently marketed. 
These new filter requirements would update the existing 30 CFR part 11 provisions to provide a particulate efficiency
determination and classification system consistent with advances in respiratory protection technology. The tests
to determine the respirator filter's particulate efficiency enable classification of the filters on their ability
to inhibit the penetration of particulates of the most penetrating size. The effectiveness of a device to remove particulates
from the ambient air would be reflected in a three-tiered classification system based on the filter's demonstrated
efficiency. Classification of the filters in this manner eliminates the need to test and classify the filter respirator
according to composition of contaminant (e.g., ``dust, fume, and mist'', ``asbestos''), since the penetration
rate for particulates in the atmosphere, regardless of composition, will not exceed that of the test particulate.
To revise respirator nomenclature to be consistent with this fundamental change in certification philosophy, the
words ``dust, fume and mist'' have been changed to ``particulate'' in the proposed rule. 
NIOSH has long been concerned with the health risks to workers due to the inappropriate selection and use of dust/mist
and dust/fume/mist respirators. Assigned Protection Factor (APF) values are used in the respirator selection process
to indicate the expected protection level. NIOSH has considered the possibility of reducing the Assigned Protection
Factor (APF) values given in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection and in the Respirator Decision
Logic for dust and fume respirators to account for filter penetration that can occur, theoretically, when these respirators
are inappropriately used against aerosols less than 2 micrometers in diameter. On September 15, 1992, NIOSH prepared
a draft report, ``A Performance Evaluation of DM and DFM Filter Respirators Certified for Protection Against Toxic
Dusts, Fumes, and Mist,'' explaining its concerns and suggested course of action. NIOSH solicited an external scientific
peer review of this draft report on September 15, 1992. This review did not support an immediate revision of the APF
values. The reviewers recommended that NIOSH address the concern about excessive filter penetration by incorporating
improved filter-penetration tests into the respirator certification regulation. 
After careful consideration of this issue, NIOSH agrees with the scientific reviewers that, during the transition
period for the implementation of the provisions contained in this rule, an adjustment of APF values is unnecessary
and may confuse respirator users. NIOSH will continue to recommend the APF values contained in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial
Respiratory Protection (September 1987) and in the Respirator Decision Logic (May 1987) for respirators previously
certified under the provisions of 30 CFR part 11. For respirators certified for protection against particulate exposures
under the new part 84 which would replace the existing Dust/Mist and Dust/Fume/Mist filter respirators under 30 CFR
part 11, NIOSH will be recommending new APF values that account for the new nomenclature and test criteria. These new
values, updating the recommendations cited above, will be published in a Respirator User's Notice accompanying
publication of this rule as final. It is anticipated that the module on Assigned Protection Factors will be proposed
in late 1994, at which time public comment will be solicited.

The current regulation in 30 CFR part 11 was developed to certify respirators used in mining and general industry.
They do not contain performance requirements for certifying air-purifying respirators against biological agents.
Likewise, the modifications to the current requirements in this proposed rule were not developed specifically to
certify respirators against biological agents. However, the provisions of this rule will address an important public
health need regarding the control of 

Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

 the causative agent of TB, transmission in health care and other facilities. 
In response to the recognized risk of TB transmission in health-care facilities, increases in TB in many areas, and
recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB, CDC has published draft recommendations revising existing CDC guidelines
for preventing the transmission of tuberculosis in health care facilities, entitled ``Guidelines for Preventing
the Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, Second Edition'', published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52810). This draft enumerates four performance criteria that CDC has determined are necessary
for respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against TB. The only currently certified
air-purifying respirator class that meets all the respiratory protection performance criteria in the CDC draft
is a respirator with a high efficiency (HEPA) filter. However, all six classes of air-purifying, particulate respirators
to be certified under the provisions of the new particulate filter tests (filter penetration) would meet or exceed
the performance recommendations contained in the CDC document. These other classes of air-purifying, particulate
respirators are expected to be markedly less expensive than respirators with HEPA filters. 
Consequently, immediate implementation of the modifications included in this rule should promote a substantial
increase in respiratory protection provided to health care and other workers potentially exposed to the 

M. tuberculosis

 droplet nuclei in health-care and other occupational settings. For this reason, NIOSH is moving forward with a schedule
to publish a final rule pertaining to particulate filters in late-1994. 


III. Public Meeting 


The record of the informal public meeting will remain open until July 8, 1994 to allow interested persons to submit
written statements or comments regarding oral presentations made at the public meeting. 
The rule is proposed to be effective as follows: 
1. 42 CFR part 84 will be effective 30 days from publication of this rule as final, and; 
2. Sale and distribution of respirators listed as certified under the provisions of 30 CFR Part 11, subparts K or M will
no longer be authorized effective 2 years from the date of publication of this rule as final. 
NIOSH is specifying an effective date for implementation for the final rule to allow the introduction of filters demonstrating
enhanced performance as soon as possible. The existing 30 CFR part 11 is expected to remain in effect for 6 months after
this rule becomes final to provide a transition period for manufacturers to prepare for new 42 CFR part 84 applications.
NIOSH believes that this period provides ample transition time for manufacturers to assemble the information necessary
for application for certification of particulate respirators under the new part 84. Additionally, 2 years from the
date this rule becomes final, respirators can no longer be distributed or sold as NIOSH-approved under part 11, subpart
K or M, unless they demonstrate compliance with and are certified under the provisions of the new part 84. This 2-year
period was selected to ensure that an ample supply of respirators remain available for use. NIOSH believes that this
timeframe will provide ample time for manufacturers to have respirators approved and manufactured in sufficient
quantities to meet the demand. NIOSH specifically requests comments on the appropriateness of a 2-year phase-in
period, as proposed. 
The administrative record of this rulemaking will consist of this May 24, 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; all
other relevant 

Federal Register

 notices; agency records on this subject; all written submissions made in response to the Notices; and the record of
the informal public meeting. The record of the informal public meeting will consist of the meeting schedule, transcripts
made by NIOSH of the oral comments at the meeting, any written comments submitted by presenters at the meeting, and
statements or comments regarding oral presentations made at the public meeting submitted by interested persons
within the allotted comment period. No written submission, or any portion thereof, made in response to this Notice
will be received or held in confidence. The administrative record of the rulemaking will be made available for viewing
and copying in the NIOSH Docket Office. All requests for any portion of the administrative record must be submitted
in writing. 
All interested persons are encouraged to submit written comments to assure receipt on or before the close of business
July 8, 1994, and to advise the NIOSH Docket Office by the necessary date of their intent to participate in the informal
public meeting. All requests for appearance at the informal public meeting should contain the name, address, and
telephone number, any business affiliation of the person desiring to make a presentation, a brief summary of the presentation,
and the approximate time requested for the presentation. NIOSH requests that oral presentations be limited to 10
minutes. Groups having similar interests are requested to combine their comments and present them through a single
representative. NIOSH will assign the time available for the meeting among the persons who properly file a request
for appearance. 
After reviewing the submitted summaries and the requests for appearance, NIOSH will schedule each appearance and
notify each participant by mail or telephone of the time assigned to the person and the approximate time the person's
oral presentation is scheduled to begin. The meeting schedule will be placed on file in the NIOSH Docket Office.

IV. Discussion of Proposed Rule_Testing of Particulate Filters


The BOM was solely responsible for testing and approving respirators until 1972. In 1972, the existing rules and procedures
in 30 CFR part 11 for approval of respiratory protective devices, or respirators, were published jointly by the BOM
and NIOSH. Since 1974, the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration (MSHA's predecessor agency), MSHA, and
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have regulated the selection, use, and maintenance of
respirators in the workplace under their enforcement authorities. With this redesignation of the requirements
for the certification of respirators, NIOSH is deleting   11.2 and 11.21 because these sections of part
11 have been superseded by OSHA's and MSHA's respirator workplace regulations. Also, the codification of the redesignated
sections into a non-hyphenated numbering system results in the deletion of several ``general heading'' sections
that contain no substantive requirements. These include   11.85, 11.102, 11.124, 11.140, and 11.162.
Existing subpart M of part 11 (  11.170 through 11.183-7) addresses the requirements for pesticide
respirators. The proposal eliminates this category and the tests specific to it, leaving subpart M reserved. The
proposal also eliminates all references to subpart M and pesticides as a classification for approval. Manufacturers
can continue to manufacture and market respirators labelled for use as pesticide respirators, as well as other contaminant
classifications, based on the testing performed under the proposed filter penetration test. NIOSH, however, would
discontinue issuance of certifications that classify these respirators as suitable for use against a specific particulate.
The proposed test would provide a suitable determination as to the effectiveness of the filter element in removing
particulates from the ambient air, regardless of the contaminant.
The existing test requirements in   11.124-21 through 11.124-24 specify a person wearing
the respirator to be exposed to an abrasive blasting environment in which the blasting agent is composed of 99+ percent
free silica (SiO

2

). The purpose of this requirement was to determine the adequacy of protection provided in such environments. Over
the past two decades, NIOSH has not conducted these tests which would pose known or potential health risks of exposure
to fractured crystalline silica to prospective test subjects. These tests have been replaced administratively.
This policy will remain in effect until these regulatory requirements are addressed in a later module.
The proposed 42 CFR part 84 regulation is generally consistent with the current MSHA and NIOSH respirator approval
program, placing responsibility for certifying most respirators with NIOSH. MSHA and NIOSH would continue to jointly
review and approve respirators used for mine emergencies, mine rescue, and the associated service-life plans, users'
manuals, and other documentation. Among the types of devices for which this role is particularly important are self-contained
self-rescue devices. This preserves MSHA's current role in the certification of certain respirators whose unique
use in mining is an important part of safeguarding the health and safety of miners. In addition, MSHA would continue
to test electrical and electronic components of respirators for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in underground
gassy mines and issue a separate MSHA approval under 30 CFR part 18 for such respirators. In implementing the proposed
regulation, NIOSH and MSHA will develop a new Memorandum of Understanding which will reflect administrative matters
related to respirator approval, including immediate notification to MSHA of field complaints and identified deficiencies
concerning approved respirators.
With the transfer of part 11 from title 30 to part 84 of title 42, MSHA and NIOSH would no longer process applications
for new approvals or extensions of approval of respirators under part 11 provisions. All applications received after
the effective date of part 84 will be considered as applications for a new or extension of approval under part 84. NIOSH
realizes that with this step in the development of part 84, some of the respirators that are currently approved would
need to be modified to meet the new requirements, while some would not. Additionally, with each step in the modular
rulemaking approach being pursued, an increasing number of respirator designs will be affected by the new regulation.
NIOSH realizes that the incremental implementation of improved test and performance requirements could cause some
confusion as to which respirators have demonstrated performance to the improved requirements. To address this possibility,
the Institute intends to continue issuing new and extension of approval numbers in the same format designation (TC
number) as issued under existing part 11 for those respirator types whose technical requirements for approval under
part 84 have not been modified from existing part 11. A new approval number series will be initiated for the products
whose technical requirements have been upgraded under part 84. By checking the approval number, respirator users
will be able to quickly and easily distinguish those products that have demonstrated the improved performance requirements
of the new part 84 from those that have demonstrated compliance with only the existing part 11 standard. The Institute
further intends to issue public notices of the new approval designations to be used for the products demonstrating
improved performance to alert users that such improved standards are available.


Section-by-Section Discussion


All sections redesignated to 42 CFR part 84 without modification from 30 CFR part 11 are not included in this discussion
of the proposed rule. The sections redesignated without modification will be revised, where appropriate, to:
(1) remove references to MSHA, except for those related to certain mining applications,
(2) update the NIOSH certifying organization to the Certification and Quality Assurance Branch, Division of Safety
Research, NIOSH, 944 Chestnut Ridge Road, Morgantown, West Virginia 26505-2888,
(3) remove references to subpart M, pesticide respirators, and tests for protection during abrasive blasting, and
(4) correct nonsubstantive typographical errors and reference the new part 84 section designations.
The sections redesignated without modification are as follows:
84.1, 84.3, 84.11, 84.12, 84.21, 84.22, 84.30, 84.31, 84.32, 84.34, 84.35, 84.36, 84.40, 84.41, 84.42, 84.43, 84.50,
84.51, 84.53, 84.60, 84.62, 84.63, 84.64, 84.65, 84.66, 84.70, 84.71, 84.72, 84.73, 84.74, 84.75, 84.76, 84.77,
84.78, 84.79, 84.80, 84.81, 84.82, 84.83, 84.84, 84.85, 84.86, 84.87, 84.88, 84.89, 84.90, 84.91, 84.92, 84.93,
84.94, 84.95, 84.96, 84.97, 84.98, 84.99, 84.100, 84.101, 84.102, 84.103, 84.104, 84.110, 84.111, 84.112, 84.113,
84.114, 84.115, 84.116, 84.117, 84.118, 84.119, 84.120, 84.121, 84.122, 84.123, 84.124, 84.126, 84.130, 84.131,

84.146, 84.147, 84.148, 84.149, 84.150, 84.151, 84.152, 84.153, 84.154, 84.155, 84.156, 84.157, 84.158, 84.159,
84.160, 84.161, 84.162, 84.163, 84.172, 84.173, 84.174, 84.175, 84.176, 84.178, 84.179, 84.186, 84.190, 84.191,
84.192, 84.193, 84.194, 84.195, 84.196, 84.197, 84.198, 84.199, 84.200, 84.201, 84.202, 84.204, 84.205, 84.207,
84.250, 84.251, 84.252, 84.253, 84.254, 84.255, 84.256, 84.257, and 84.258.
These sections, and revisions of these sections, will be subject to public comment in future rulemaking.
The following section-by-section analysis discusses each new or revised section to 42 CFR part 84. All part and section
references for part 11 are to Title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR). All part and section references for
part 84 are to Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (42 CFR).


Subpart A_General Provisions


Section 84.2 Definitions


This section would be redesignated and revised from the existing  11.3.
The existing definitions for ``air contamination level'', ``Bureau'', ``concentration limits for radionuclides'',
``DOP'', ``MESA'', ``pesticide'', ``radionuclides'', and ``smoke'' would be deleted. These terms are used in provisions
that are modified or deleted as a result of the filter penetration test changes being proposed. These definitions
would, therefore, become unnecessary.
The existing definition for ``Testing and Certification Laboratory'' would be modified to reflect the present name
of the organization as the ``Certification and Quality Assurance Branch.''

Section 84.4 Respirators For Mine Rescue or Other Emergency Use In Mines


This section would be new, and would maintain MSHA's role in the approval of respirators designed for mine rescue or
other mine emergency use. Under the proposal MSHA and NIOSH would conduct joint review and certification of respirators
used for mine emergencies and mine rescue. This provision recognizes MSHA's expertise in identifying the special
needs and considerations for respirators used in the mining environment. This role would replace MSHA's existing
role as a joint approver of all respirators.
Paragraph (a) specifies that NIOSH and MSHA would jointly certify any respirator designed for mine emergencies,
mine rescue or other emergency use in mines. This joint review and certification would include any associated service-life
plans, user's manuals, and other supporting documentation. This paragraph further specifies that certifications
for these respirators include any identified use limitations related to mine safety and health as a condition of certification.
Paragraph (b) specifies NIOSH and MSHA would jointly address recall and retrofit matters arising from field complaints
or identified deficiencies concerning any respirators used in the mining environment. The new Memorandum of Understanding
would further delineate MSHA's role in such matters, including participation in any related field or manufacturing
site audits.


Subpart B_Application for Approval


Section 84.10 Application Procedures


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.10 with only paragraph (e) modified. Paragraph (e) would
retain the existing requirement for inspection, examination, and testing by MSHA of electrical and electronic components
to be permissible in accordance with 30 CFR part 18 for respirators intended for use in mining environments and having
permissible electrical or electronic components. MSHA would continue to conduct this testing and issue a separate
MSHA approval number for those respirators found acceptable. The process for conducting the permissibility evaluation
of these components and their identification would remain unchanged from the existing policies and practices.


Subpart C_Fees


Section 84.20 Examination, Inspection, and Testing of Complete Respirator Assemblies; Fees


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.20, and modified only to reflect the new particulate filter
classification scheme.


Subpart D_Approval and Disapproval


Section 84.33 Approval Labels and Markings; Approval of Contents; Use


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.33.
Paragraph (b) would specify the use of the NIOSH emblem on the approval label, replacing the MSHA emblem.
Paragraph (e) of this section would be modified to identify the existing ``dust, fume, and mist'' class of respirator
as a ``particulate'' respirator. The new designation is consistent with the proposed testing criteria under which
these respirators are certified. The table in paragraph (e) identifying the approval label requirements would be
modified by the removal of references specific to paint spray and pesticide respirators, also consistent with the
changes associated with the instantaneous penetration tests.


Subpart F_Classification of Approved Respirators; Scope of Approval; Atmospheric Hazards; Service Time


Section 84.52 Respiratory Hazards; Classification


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.52.
It would be modified only to delete paragraph (d). Reference to the pesticide ``classification'' would no longer
be appropriate with the introduction of the ``particulates'' classification with the new instantaneous-penetration
test.


Subpart G_General Construction and Performance Requirements


Section 84.61 General Construction Requirements


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.61.
The provision for respirator components to meet the permissibility requirements of 30 CFR part 18 [paragraph (e)]
would be deleted because MSHA's workplace regulations separately and independently establish this requirement
for certain mining applications. This change would be consistent with existing practice, whereby, MSHA conducts
the evaluation and testing of these components and issues a separate approval to cover this aspect of respirator design.

Subpart I_Gas Masks 



Section 84.125 Particulate Tests; Canisters Containing Particulate Filters; Minimum Requirements



This section would be redesignated from existing  11.102-4, without modification except to specify
the new requirements that respirators for protection against particulates (dusts, fumes, mists, and smokes) in
combination with gases, vapors, or gases and vapors, must meet. With the exception of the airflow resistance test
of  84.183, these respirators are required to meet the proposed requirements specified in   84.170
through 84.186. 



Subpart K_Particulate Respirators 



Section 84.170 Particulate Respirators; Description



This section would be derived from existing  11.130. It would be revised to define particulate respirators
in a more concise way than previously provided for those designed for protection against dusts, fumes, and mists.


Paragraph (a) would describe particulate air-purifying respirators as those designed with filters to provide respiratory
protection against atmospheres that: (1) Contain adequate oxygen to support life and (2) are contaminated with particulates
not immediately dangerous to life or health. The particulates for which protection would be provided include contaminants
such as dusts, fumes, mists and smoke. The respirator could be designed to remove contaminants, either solid or both
liquid and solid, from the wearer's breathing air. 

Paragraph (b) would establish the classification of particulate air-purifying respirators as either powered or
non-powered. Powered respirators would include those designs where a motor or other device enhances the air flow
of inhalation air through the filter to provide breathing air to the wearer. Non-powered respirators would include
respirators that depend solely on the inhalation and exhalation of the wearer to provide an adequate supply of purified-breathing
air to the wearer. Either class of respirator, powered or non-powered, could be designed and intended for removal
of solid particulates only or for both liquid and solid particulates. A ``liquid only'' category is not included because
a filter that can effectively remove liquid particulates from the ambient air will also effectively remove solid
particulates. 

Paragraphs (c) and (d) would establish the classification of filter elements used with non-powered and powered air-purifying
respirators, respectively. These classifications are based on the filter's efficiency in removing particulates
from the ambient air as demonstrated by the test requirements specified in this subpart. 

Paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1), (c)(2) and (d)(2), and (c)(3) would define the efficiency level for particulate removal
needed to be achieved in the performance testing for a filter element to be classified as a Type A, B, or C filter, respectively.
A Type A filter would be required to perform at a minimum efficiency of 99.97%, a Type B filter at a minimum efficiency
of 99%, and a Type C at a minimum efficiency of 95%. 



Section 84.171 Particulate Respirators; Required Components



This section would be redesignated from existing  11.131, modified only to incorporate the new terminology
of ``particulates'' to describe dusts, fumes and mists. 



Section 84.177 Inhalation and Exhalation Valves; Minimum Requirements



This section would be redesignated from existing  11.137, modified only to delete reference to the existing
silica dust tests for single-use respirators of  11.140-5. The respirator performance requirements
of these existing tests are replaced by the particulate instantaneous filter penetration test contained in this
proposal. 



Section 84.180 Particulate Respirators; Filter Type Identification



This section proposes a new classification system for identification of the efficiency of the filters for particulate
respirators. The new proposed terminology of ``particulate respirator'' would replace the existing ``dust, fume,
and mist respirator'', as discussed previously. 

The requirement for the manufacturer to specify the filter-efficiency/particulate-type classification in the
certification application would be contained in paragraph (a). This classification would include the type of particulates
that the filter is designed to remove, either solid or both liquid and solid, and the expected efficiency of the filter
based on the test requirements specified in  84.184. 

The information to be included on the label of a filter for a certified particulate respirator is specified in paragraphs
(b)(1) through (b)(6). This labeling would define the efficiency level achieved in the performance testing (i.e.,
Type A, B, or C filter) and whether the filter would perform properly in the removal of solid only (S) or both liquid and
solid (L&S) particulates.
 This information would be necessary to allow the user to make an informed decision on selecting the appropriate respiratory
protection. To facilitate this selection process, the Type A, L&S filters are color coded magenta to allow them
to be easily distinguished from the other filter types. The filters other than Type A, L&S could be of any color,
except magenta. This color coding would be consistent with the present universally-accepted color-code convention
which identifies the best performing filters (HEPA's) by their magenta color. 



Section 84.181 Isoamyl Acetate Tightness Test; Particulate Respirators With Filters Not Intended To Be
Replaced



This section would be redesignated from existing  11.140-1 with the test unchanged. Because the proposal
would not classify respirators as designed for protection against fumes from various metals having an air contamination
level not less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter, the test would be redirected to evaluate the performance of particulate
respirators with filters not intended to be replaced.

Section 84.182 Isoamyl Acetate Tightness Test; Respirators With Replaceable Filters; Minimum Requirements



This section would be redesignated from existing  11.140-2 with the test unchanged. Because the proposal
would not classify respirators designed for protection against dusts, fumes and mists having an air contamination
level less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter, or radionuclides, the test would be redirected to evaluate the performance
of particulate respirators with replaceable filters. 



Section 84.183 Airflow-Resistance Tests



Section 84.183 would be redesignated from  11.140-9, modified to delete the final inhalation resistance
requirements. The proposed instantaneous-penetration tests are not designed to simulate loading of the filter
at the worksite, and represent a significant change in the testing philosophy from the existing requirements. Therefore,
these requirements would not be necessary or appropriate with the introduction of these new tests. 



Section 84.184 Particulate Instantaneous-Penetration-Filter Test



This section would be new. Section 84.184 would specify the test criteria and acceptable performance criteria for
the new particulate instantaneous-penetration-filter test. 

Paragraph (a) would require the instantaneous-penetration efficiency testing of 30 filters of each particulate
respirator model. Testing would be conducted using a solid particulate aerosol or an oil liquid particulate aerosol
for solid particulate certification and both liquid and solid particulate certification, respectively. 

Paragraph (b) would apply to filters having separable air-purifying elements. All the respirator's air-purifying
elements, including the element's holders and gaskets, are specified to be installed on the respirator as used when
mounted for testing. 

Paragraph (c) would require the preconditioning of all air-purifying elements of the respirators prior to testing.
The elements, removed from their packaging, are placed in an environment of 85

#

5 percent relative humidity at 38

#

2.5 degrees celsius (100

#

4.5 degrees fahrenheit) for 25

#

1 hours. Following the humidity conditioning, filters are required to be sealed in a gas-tight container until tested.


Paragraph (d) would apply to filters having non-separable air-purifying elements. It would require the exhalation
valves to be sealed during the testing. Sealing of the valves would ensure that the test results were not affected by
any valve leakage, if present. 

Paragraph (e) would specify the continuous test-aerosol airflow rates to be used in testing single and paired filters.
Respirators with a single filter are penetration-tested at a continuous airflow rate of 85 liters (3.0 cubic feet)
per minute 

#

5 percent. For pairs, the test-aerosol airflow rate would be 42.5 liters (1.5 cubic feet) per minute 

#

5 percent through each filter. This airflow rate is representative of a high work rate. These test conditions would
ensure that a sufficient number of particulates are applied to the filter during the test period to provide an adequate
indication of the efficiency of the filters. 

Paragraph (f) would specify the test criteria for powered air-purifying particulate respirators (PAPRs). The PAPRs
are penetration tested while operating in their routine operational mode. This would require fully-charged batteries,
if so equipped, or at normal line voltage, if line-powered. PAPRs with loose fitting facepieces are tested in a free-flow
mode, while those with tight-fitting facepieces are tested on a headform connected to a breathing machine or equivalent
breathing device. The breathing machine would have a workrate cam of 622 kp-m/min. operated at a rate of 24 respirations
per minute with a minute volume of 40 liters. 

Paragraph (g) would describe the penetration test aerosols and the test criteria to be used. A sodium chloride solid
aerosol would be used when testing for filter leakage of solid particulate aerosols. A neutralized-dioctyl phthalate
(DOP), or equivalent oil, liquid aerosol would be specified as the testing agent when testing for filter leakage of
liquid particulate aerosols. The penetration test would be continued until maximum penetration is achieved or until
an aerosol mass of at least 200

#

5 mg for non-powered respirators, or at least 2,000

#

50 mg for powered air-purifying respirators, has contacted the filter unit. 

Paragraph (g)(1) would identify the test conditions for the sodium chloride solid aerosol to be at 25

#

5 degrees celsius (77

#

9 degrees fahrenheit) and relative humidity of less than 30 percent. The aerosol specified to be used in these tests
would be neutralized to the Boltzmann equilibrium state, and the maximum concentration would not exceed 200 mg/m3.


Paragraph (g)(2) would specify the DOP or equivalent oil, liquid particulate aerosol. The test conditions for the
liquid aerosol are specified to be at 25

#

5 degrees celsius. The aerosol specified to be used in these tests would be neutralized to the Boltzmann equilibrium
state, and the maximum concentration would not exceed 200 mg/m3. 

Paragraph (h) would specify the particle size limitations at the test conditions for the filter-penetration-test
aerosols. The sodium chloride aerosol would have a particle size distribution with count median diameter between
0.06 and 0.11 micrometer and a standard geometric deviation not exceeding 1.84. The liquid particulate aerosol would
have a particle size distribution with count median diameter between 0.17 and 0.22 micrometer and a standard geometric
deviation not exceeding 1.60. These particle size distribution values would be determined at the specified test
conditions with a differential mobility particle sizer.

Paragraph (i) would require the instantaneous penetration of the filter (i.e., the amount of aerosol particles that
pass through the filter) to be monitored and recorded throughout the test period by a suitable forward-light-scattering
photometer or equivalent instrumentation. 

Paragraph (j) would require the maximum filter penetration for each of the 30 filters to be determined and recorded.
The mean maximum penetration, m, and the standard deviation, s, would be required to be calculated from these data.

The test static U for the particulate respirator filter would be calculated as the sum of the mean maximum penetration
and 2.22 multiplied by the standard deviation. The test static would be used to determine if the performance of the
filter would meet the requirement for the requested classification (type). For a type A filter, the test static would
be less than or equal to 0.0003; for a type B, the test static would be less than or equal to 0.01; for a type C, the test static
would be less than or equal to 0.05. 



Section 84.185 Powered, Particulate Respirator Flow Requirements 


This section would be new. It would specify the minimum requirements and criteria for verification of the airflow
rates of powered, particulate respirators. This section would also define the classes as loose-fitting and tight-fitting,
depending on their reliance on the tightness of the face seal. 

The airflow of a powered air-purifying respirator would be measured after each of the penetration tests. The airflow
requirements that a powered air-purifying respirator would be required to meet are specified based on its design
classification as tight-fitting or loose-fitting. The minimum airflow requirements for each class are specified
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. A tight-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirator would be defined as
designed to seal to the wearer's face and provide protection as a non-powered respirator in the event of a blower failure.
A loose-fitting, powered, air-purifying respirator would be defined as designed to function without reliance on
a tight-fitting face seal. 

Paragraph (a) would require tight-fitting, powered air-purifying respirators to maintain an air-flow rate of at
least 115 liters (4.06 cubic feet) per minute for a period of at least 4 hours unless otherwise specified. 

Paragraph (b) would require loose-fitting, powered air-purifying respirators to maintain an air-flow rate of at
least 170 liters (6.0 cubic feet) per minute for a period of at least 4 hours, unless otherwise specified. 

Paragraph (c) would require powered air-purifying respirators to be provided with an acceptable mechanism and appropriate
instructions, whereby, the user can routinely and simply determine that the minimum airflow is maintained. 



Subpart L_Chemical Cartridge Respirators 



Section 84.203 Breathing Resistance Tests; Minimum Requirements


This section would be redesignated from existing  11.162-1. 
It would be modified only to delete reference to various ``classifications'', such as paints and pneumoconiosis
and fibrous producing dusts, that would no longer be appropriate with the introduction of the ``particulates'' classification
with the new instantaneous-penetration test.

V. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 




Section 1 of Executive Order 12866 requires that before the Department promulgates a new regulation, the need for
the regulation must be assessed, alternatives identified and assessed, the regulations designed to achieve their
objectives in the most cost-effective manner, and, to the extent feasible, use performance standards. In addition,
Section 5 of the Order requires an assessment of the burden imposed by existing regulations, to identify those that
have become unjustified or unnecessary as a result of changed circumstances. The Department is proposing these changes
in compliance with both sections of the Executive Order.

The Department generally prepares a regulatory flexibility analysis, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, if the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. That Act also requires
that the Department periodically review existing regulations and consider reforming those that burden small entities,
taking into account the degree to which technology or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule. 
The Department does not believe that this proposal is ``economically significant'' within the definition of E.O.
12866 (e.g., it would not have an effect on the economy of $100 million). Nor does the Department believe that the proposal
will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small firms. However, it will create costs for some firms
in the respirator industry, and benefits for hospitals and other entities using respirators. The magnitude of these
effects is uncertain. Accordingly, the Department has prepared the following voluntary Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis. 
Most employers rely on government standards to determine acceptable levels of respirator performance. It would
be inefficient and unreasonably costly for each of millions of occasional purchasers of these inexpensive devices
to independently attempt to determine which devices operate effectively to filter out minuscule particles. 
This proposal will remove a regulatory impediment to the improved design of respirators by substituting a performance
standard for an obsolete specifications standard. The practical effect of this will be to enable firms to substitute
a more effective and efficient filter material in low-cost Class B and Class C respirators (respirators already using
high efficiency filters meeting Class A requirements will not be affected by this proposal). 
It is our understanding that substituting better filter material will have negligible effects on the costs of filters,
over the long run. The material may cost very slightly more, but its cost will remain measured in pennies per filter.
NIOSH specifically solicits comments and data for projected estimates of cost for materials and labor for these improved
respirators. 
The demonstrated level of performance for filters will, however, be substantially more effective. Instead of an
efficiency rate of 95 percent for removing particles sized at 1 to 2 micrometers in diameter, they will demonstrate
the ability to remove particles of less than 1 micrometer in diameter at a typical efficiency rate of 95 to 99.97 percent.
The importance of this change will vary considerably from workplace setting to setting. However, in at least some
settings the benefits will be considerable. 
For example, the classes of particulate filter respirators certified under this rule will meet or exceed the CDC recommendations
for respiratory protective devices used for 

M. tuberculosis.

 Of the currently NIOSH-certified respirators, only high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters meet or exceed
these recommendations. The certification to an enhanced performance level will create options for the choice of
respirators that adhere to CDC recommendations at reduced expense. A disposable (one-time use) HEPA filter respirator
generally sells for around $7 to $10 and replaceable respirators equipped with HEPA filters can cost $20 or more, with
replacement filters costing about $5 each. Replacement non-HEPA filters cost about $1 to $2 each. Disposable non-HEPA
filters cost about $1 to $8 each when purchased in bulk.

The Department would expect similar effects_both improved health and cost avoidance_in many other settings. The
Department does not have any basis at this time for quantifying either benefits or costs. The Department does know
that as many as seven million workers use respirators at some time each year. NIOSH estimates that employers annually
purchase over 110 million disposable respirators. The Department requests comments on potential savings in other
settings. 
There are approximately 35 manufacturers of these devices. NIOSH believes that most of these already possess or have
access to test equipment needed to perform the new filter tests the Department proposes to require. As is currently
required under 30 CFR part 11, NIOSH would continue to require that applicants conduct or have conducted examinations,
inspections, and tests of respirator performance at least equivalent to those set by the respirator certification
tests. This is to assure that all necessary research and development is conducted by the applicant prior to submitting
an application to the Federal Government for testing of the respirator by NIOSH. For those manufacturers that do not
currently possess this capability, NIOSH estimates that the purchase of this equipment represents an investment
of approximately $60,000. Amortized over time, this would not represent a significant cost for most manufacturers.

Filter materials are currently available that can be substituted into present filter designs with minimal redesign
(if any) to meet the performance requirements of the new tests. Some currently NIOSH-certified respirators have,
when tested using the new standards, demonstrated acceptable performance. Therefore, little or no cost will be needed
to develop suitable filtration materials or redesign existing devices. However, the Department does realize that
additional development and redesign costs may be incurred to augment the presently available products. NIOSH specifically
requests relevant data and comments on projected costs of redesign of respirators. 
Notwithstanding these general conclusions, there may be some manufacturers that will find it financially difficult,
or a poor investment, to meet the new standards. The Department would expect such problems to result from free market
competition rather than the specific standards of these proposed regulations. That is, most knowledgeable employers
would purchase more cost-effective respirators voluntarily and force major changes in the market if the present
regulatory barriers were removed. Nonetheless, there may be regulatory alternatives that would minimize burdens
on the smallest firms and the Department welcomes suggestions for these.

As shown in Figure 1 of this section, the blower crank is replaced by a wooden drum, a (13 cm. (5 inches) in diameter is
convenient). This drum is wound with about 12 m. (40 feet) of No. 2 picture cord, b. A weight, c, of sufficient mass to
rotate the blower at the desired speed is suspended from this wire cord. A mark is made on the cord about 3 to 4.5 m. (10
to 15 feet) from the weight, c. Another mark is placed at a measured distance (6-9 m./20-30 feet is convenient)
from the first. These are used to facilitate timing. To determine the torque or horsepower required to operate the
blower, the drum is started in rotation manually at or slightly above the speed at which the power measurement is to
be made. The blower is then permitted to assume constant speed, and then as the first mark on the wire leaves the drum,
a stopwatch is started. The watch is stopped when the second mark leaves the drum. From these data the foot-pounds per
minute and the torque may be calculated.

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposal would remove existing rules for the joint approval of respiratory protective equipment by the Mine
Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The existing rules would be replaced by revised approval procedures
and technical requirements for respirators being proposed by NIOSH in a separate rulemaking. The existing rules,
which are currently administered jointly by NIOSH and MSHA, would be replaced by new rules, which will be administered
solely by NIOSH, with joint certification and approval by NIOSH and MSHA of certain specified mining-related devices.
Removal of the existing rules would be contingent upon the NIOSH rulemaking becoming final. Existing provisions
for the selection, use, and maintenance of respirators at coal mines would be retained and recodified. This notice
should be read in conjunction with the proposed rule published by NIOSH elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The existing rules and procedures in 30 CFR part 11 for approval of respiratory protective devices, or respirators,
evolved from rules and procedures developed by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines. Until 1972, the
Bureau of Mines was solely responsible for testing and approving respirators. In 1972, the Bureau of Mines and NIOSH
jointly published 30 CFR part 11. These regulations replaced the Bureau of Mines' rules and procedures, and delineated
the responsibilities of the two agencies. Under these regulations, the Bureau of Mines evaluated respirator performance,
and NIOSH was responsible for administration of the quality control provisions. The Bureau of Mines also tested the
safety of electrical components of respirators intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres in underground
gassy mines (intrinsic safety) under the requirements of 30 CFR part 18. 

A Memorandum of Understanding between the two agencies of May 30, 1972, refined their respective roles and in 1973,
part 11 was amended. Under this arrangement, NIOSH undertook primary 
responsibility for performance testing of respirators. Although all approvals continued to be issued jointly,
the Bureau of Mines principally retained only the responsibility to test for intrinsic safety the small number of
respirators with electrical components intended for use in gassy underground mines. 
In 1974, the Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration, MSHA's predecessor agency, was created and the responsibilities
of the Bureau of Mines under part 11 were transferred to that agency. Since it was created in 1978, MSHA has continued
to test electrical components of certain respirators for intrinsic safety and has issued separate approvals for
respirators meeting the requirements of 30 CFR part 18. While MSHA currently reviews applications for respirator
approvals and has conducted some product evaluations, laboratory testing, quality assurance, and product audit
for certain respirators, the testing and certification activities specified by part 11 are primarily conducted
by NIOSH. 


II. Discussion of Proposal 


Elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

, NIOSH is proposing in a separate rulemaking to transfer requirements for the approval of respiratory protective
equipment to 42 CFR part 84, and upgrade the testing requirements for particulate filters. Under the NIOSH proposal,
MSHA and NIOSH would continue to review and approve respirators jointly for mine emergencies and mine rescue, and
their associated service-life plans and users' manuals. Among the types of devices which would continue to be subject
to joint approval are self-contained, self-rescue devices. Retention of joint approval under the NIOSH proposal
would preserve MSHA's role in the certification of certain respirators whose unique use in mining is an important
part of safeguarding the health and safety of miners. In addition, MSHA would continue to test electrical components
of certain respirators to be used in mines and issue a separate MSHA approval under 30 CFR part 18 for such respirators.

<PARENT> FR940524-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In implementing the proposed regulation, NIOSH and MSHA will develop a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
will reflect the roles of both agencies in the respirator approval program. For example, the MOU will provide that
NIOSH will notify MSHA immediately of field complaints and identified deficiencies concerning approved respirators.

MSHA's rulemaking would remove part 11 from title 30. Removal of part 11 would, however, be contingent on publication
of the NIOSH proposal as a final rule. All existing MSHA respirator use provisions in part 11 would be retained and recodified
in 30 CFR parts 70 and 71. 
Commenters responding to the separate NIOSH proposal to revise the particulate filter provisions should direct
those comments to NIOSH, to be included in the appropriate rulemaking record. The issue of MSHA's role in the approval
of respirators will also be the subject of the NIOSH proposal and, therefore, commenters should direct responses
on this issue to both MSHA and NIOSH. Both rulemaking activities will be coordinated to ensure that the level of protection
afforded to miners and other affected workers is maintained at all times during the transition period. All technical
data and commenter information will be shared by the respective agencies. 


III. Other Sections Affected 


After the title 42 rulemaking is completed and part 11 is removed, MSHA anticipates that conforming nomenclature
revisions would be needed in standards in title 30 that reference the use of approved respirators. 
These conforming nomenclature revisions may require that references be made to NIOSH, or that references to MSHA
or the Secretary of Labor be deleted. Nothing in the anticipated nomenclature revisions would change the compliance
responsibility of mine operators, who would continue to be required to provide miners with ``approved'' respirators.



IV. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. In addition, this rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not been prepared.



V. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The recordkeeping and reporting requirements in 30 CFR part 11 would be transferred to 42 CFR part 84 under NIOSH. Comments
on these requirements should be addressed directly to NIOSH.

Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger; Proposed Rule

Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by permitting
percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided such product labeling contains nutrition
information. This proposed rule would provide increased flexibility in the labeling of ground beef and hamburger,
and would also allow consumers to readily identify and differentiate between the varying lean/fat percentages of
these products. FSIS is taking this action in response to comments received after publication of the final nutrition
labeling regulations and a petition submitted by Western States Meat Association, Oakland, CA, and encourages comments
on all aspects of the proposed rule including nutrition information. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



FSIS has determined that this proposed rule is significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. FSIS has assessed
the impacts of its proposed rule that would permit percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger.
This rule would provide an incentive to maintain or reduce fat in ground beef and hamburger which represent over 45
percent of the domestic beef supply. About 41 percent of the ground beef is sold through retail outlets. 



Benefits of the Proposed Rule 



Without this rule, processors and retailers of raw ground beef and hamburger would be essentially prohibited from
making any lean or extra lean claims. Some producers of hamburger have made substantial strides in reducing the fat
content which has been communicated as ``

XX

 percent lean.'' The provisions of the proposed rule allow for presentation of objective and truthful information
that would enable consumers to distinguish among products that range anywhere from 10 to 30 percent fat by weight.
Consumers would obtain health benefits by seeing terms with which they are familiar and have used since 1973 to select
leaner versions of these ground products. The labeling flexibility should provide manufacturers and retailers
an incentive to maintain or reduce fat content in ground beef and hamburger. By requiring nutrition labeling and ``

XX

 percent fat,'' whenever a product displays the ``

XX

 percent lean'' content, industry is given a greater incentive to market and promote reduced fat ground beef products
with higher lean contents than would occur under the final nutrition labeling regulations to take effect on July 6,
1994. FSIS believes that this nutrition information helps consumers make better food choices and provides incentives
to continue producing nutritionally-improved products which contribute substantially to the health benefits
associated with nutrition labeling. FSIS believes that this exemption is properly limited to ground beef products
due to the past labeling practices of using lean and extra lean terms primarily on ground beef products. If there is
sufficient interest to extend this flexibility to other ground product, the final analysis will assess the benefits
and costs. 



Costs of the Proposed Rule 



The cost of the proposed regulations for nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger consists of presenting complete
nutrition information obtained from existing databases on the labeling of the product or in the form of point-of-purchase
materials when percentage labeling for lean and fat is used. The products on which FSIS is proposing to permit the percentage
labeling are single-ingredient, raw ground beef products that fall under the voluntary nutrition labeling program
if they do not contain added seasoning.

<TEXT>
 

FSIS believes that the costs associated with this proposed rule will be negligible and indistinguishable from the
costs associated with the voluntary nutrition labeling program because the same point-of-purchase materials can
serve both needs. FSIS's final regulation on nutrition labeling specifies that retail stores voluntarily provide
quantitative nutrition information for these products, and that the nutrition information may be supplied by point-of-purchase
material. Also, FSIS will survey retailers to ascertain whether there is significant participation in the program.
If FSIS determines that significant participation does not exist, it will initiate rulemaking to determine whether
it would be beneficial to require nutrition labeling on these products. 

FSIS has not assessed whether multiple uses of the term ``percent lean'' on USDA-regulated foods might result in any
misunderstanding among consumers, or whether any such misunderstanding might limit informed consumer choice.




Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient
requirements on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under
the FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat products that
are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded
or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their
entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required 
under the FMIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products and
establishments. 

No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision
of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA. The administrative procedures specified
in 9 CFR part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this rule
with respect to labeling decisions. 



Effect on Small Entities 



The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect on small entities, as
defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The Agency finds that this proposed rule would result in
positive net benefits because it would allow for increased flexibility in labeling rules. Small meat establishments
are exempt from nutrition labeling, provided the labeling of their products bears no nutrition claims or nutrition
information. Therefore, most small establishments would not be affected by this proposed rule. 



Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposed rule. Written comments should
be sent to the Policy Office at the address shown above and should refer to Docket Number 93-030P. All comments
submitted in response to this proposal will be available for public inspection in the Policy Office from 9 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 



Background 



FSIS published a final rule entitled ``Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products'' in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632) (corrected at 58 FR 43787, August 18, 1993, and amended at 58 FR 47624, September 10, 1993).
The final rule amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations by permitting voluntary nutrition
labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products and by establishing mandatory nutrition labeling
for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. It provides definitions at 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462
for specific nutrient content claims, including the terms ``lean'' and ``extra lean.'' The definitions include
fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol criteria that take into consideration the inherent presence of these nutrients
in meat and poultry products. The use of the terms ``lean'' and ``extra lean'' provide meat and poultry products with
unique descriptive terms that allow consumers to readily identify and compare products with distinctive levels
of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol within the meat and poultry product category. 

Under the final nutrition labeling regulations, ground beef and hamburger may be labeled ``lean'' if they contain
less than 10 
grams of fat, 4.5 or less grams of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol, per 100 grams and Reference
Amount Customarily Consumed (RACC) for individual foods. Ground beef and hamburger may be labeled ``extra lean''
if they contain less than 5 grams of fat, less than 2 grams of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol,
per 100 grams and RACC for individual foods. Ground beef and hamburger, however, seldom meet these criteria, and are
virtually precluded from using these terms. 

FSIS's correction to the final nutrition labeling regulations (58 FR 43788) at 9 CFR 317.362(a)(2) and 381.462(a)(2)
defined the term ``

XX

 percent lean'' as a synonym for the term ``

XX

 percent fat free.'' To qualify for a ``

XX

 percent lean'' claim, the product must meet the definition for ``low fat.'' The ``low fat'' definition allows 3 grams
or less fat per RACC for individual foods. Since the final nutrition labeling regulations did not provide an exemption
for ground beef and hamburger, these products must meet the definition of ``low fat'' to be labeled with a lean percentage.
This restriction virtually
