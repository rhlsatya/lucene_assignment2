Oranges, Grapefruit, Tangerines, and Tangelos Grown in Florida; Revision of Special Purpose Shipment Exemption
Provisions for Organic Citrus Fruit 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule invites comments on the revision of the administrative rules and regulations of the marketing
order for Florida citrus. This rule redefines the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' to mean those persons who handle
citrus fruit which is certified as organically grown under Florida law, and requires such persons to certify that
they will limit shipments of such fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruit. This rule more precisely defines
organically grown Florida citrus fruit, and may increase the market for organic shipments. This rule was unanimously
recommended by the Citrus Administrative Committee (committee), the agency responsible for local administration
of the marketing order.

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 (7 CFR part 905) regulating
the handling of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order.
This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This interim final rule
is not intended to have retroactive effect. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are about 100 Florida citrus handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering oranges, grapefruit,
tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, and about 11,000 growers of these citrus fruits in Florida. Small agricultural
service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts
of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural growers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000.
A minority of these handlers and a majority of the growers may be classified as small entities. 
The marketing order for Florida citrus provides for the establishment of minimum grade and size requirements. The
minimum grade and size requirements are designed to provide fresh markets with fruit of acceptable quality, thereby
maintaining consumer confidence for fresh Florida citrus. This helps create buyer confidence and contributes to
stable marketing conditions. This is in the interest of producers, packers, and consumers, and is designed to increase
returns to Florida citrus growers. 
The cultural practices of producers of organically grown citrus differ from normal industry practices. Because
of these differences, organically grown fruit is usually required to meet a different grade standard under the marketing
order. This grade standard pertains only to the external characteristics of the fruit, not the internal quality.

The different grade standard is needed to facilitate the marketing of organic citrus. There are indications that
organically grown citrus, from a marketing standpoint, are a different commodity than conventionally grown citrus.
Organic citrus generally has higher external damage. Organic fruit for the most part is marketed differently, is
not mixed with non-organic fruit, appeals only to certain consumers, and is in many respects, a specialized commodity.

This action invites comments on changes to the administrative rules and regulations prescribed under the Florida
citrus marketing order. This rule more precisely defines organic fruit, and the type of market outlets which organically
grown fruit may be sold in, free from certain requirements imposed under the order. These changes were unanimously
recommended by the committee at its November 16, 1993 meeting.

Sections 905.146, 905.147, and 905.148 of the regulations provide terms and conditions under which shippers may
ship organically grown Florida citrus fruit, as Special Purpose Shippers, with a conditional release from certain
grade requirements issued under  905.52 of the order. 
When the provisions concerning special purpose shipments were made effective in 1978, there were no laws governing
organic fruit and vegetable growers in Florida. A ``Special Purpose Shipper'' was defined under the marketing order
as one who had certified that they would handle only citrus fruit which they knew from their own personal knowledge
was produced on trees on which only compost, non-acidulated fertilizer such as rock phosphate, dolomite, or ground
limestone is used, and to which no chemical insecticide or fungicide had been applied. However, the State of Florida
now requires all organically grown fruits and vegetables to be certified. Accordingly, the committee has recommended
redefining the term ``Special Purpose Shipper'' in  905.146 to mean a person who handles Florida citrus fruit
that is certified by a Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licensed certifying agent as organically
grown under Florida law. This definition reflects that organic fruit has been certified under Florida law, and also
provides additional assurance that shippers claiming organic status and utilizing the grade standards for organic
fruit qualify to do so. 
Under Florida law, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services licenses independent third parties
to act as certifying agents. Growers who intend to sell organic fruit make an application to a certifying agent. The
certifying agent inspects and certifies a grower's acreage as being in accordance with Florida law and issues the
grower a certificate. The certificate number is transferred to a trip ticket which accompanies any shipments of fruit
grown on the certified acreage. When the handler receives the shipment, a copy of the trip ticket is provided to the
state inspector indicating that the fruit is certified organic and can be packed using the applicable organic grade
standards. 
The committee also recommended that  905.146 be revised to require Special Purpose Shippers to certify that
they will limit their shipments of organically grown citrus fruit to outlets handling organically grown fruits.
This replaces the requirement that only outlets registered and approved by the committee could receive such fruit
and ends the requirement that receivers of special purpose shipments complete the applicable sections of the Report
of Special Purpose Shipments form. 
The language in  905.146, 905.147, 905.148 concerning Certificates of Privilege is being revised for clarity,
and procedural safeguards are being added to  905.147(c) dealing with suspensions or denials of Certificates
of Privilege. 
This rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the exemption provisions
for special purpose shipments, as specified. The Departmental view is that this rule may have a beneficial impact
on growers and shippers of organic citrus fruit. 
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements
that are contained in this rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have
been assigned OMB number 0581-0094. This action will reduce the reporting burden on approximately 95 receivers
of special purpose shipments of Florida citrus completing a section of the Report of Special Purpose Shipments form,
taking about .04 hour to complete each report. 
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other available
information, it is found that this interim final rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) This rule updates provisions in the regulations; (2) Florida citrus fruit handlers are aware of this
rule which was unanimously recommended by the committee at a public meeting and they will need no additional time to
comply with the revised requirements; (3) shipment of the 1993-94 season Florida citrus fruit crop is currently
in progress; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any comments received will be considered prior
to any finalization of this interim final rule.

the Certificate of Privilege issued to such Special Purpose Shipper may be suspended or, in the case of an application
for the issuance of an initial Certificate of Privilege, may be denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be for
a reasonable period of time as determined by 
the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the current fiscal period. In the case of the denial of
an application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes
into compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Prior to suspending or denying
an application for a Certificate of Privilege, the committee shall give the shipper or applicant reasonable advance
notice in writing of its intention and the facts and reasons therefor, and afford the shipper or applicant an opportunity,

Revision of Class E Airspace; Juneau and Dillingham, AK



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action revises Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. The FAA is preparing to develop and test Differential
Global Positioning System (DGPS) instrument approach and departure procedures at the Juneau Airport. Additional
controlled airspace starting at 700 feet above the surface (AGL) is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) departure
and arrival operations at the airport. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham is being revised
so that recently developed instrument flight rule (IFR) holding patterns are in controlled airspace. The areas will
be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History



On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise
Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. (59 FR 12876.) The FAA is preparing to develop DGPS instrument approach/departure
procedures for the Juneau Airport at Juneau, AK. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace extending from
700 feet AGL in the Juneau area for IFR operations. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham was
proposed to be revised so that recently developed IFR holding patterns are contained in controlled airspace.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received.

Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace.
Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).

The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



These amendments to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revise Class E airspace at Juneau, AK, to provide controlled
airspace from 700 feet AGL for IFR DGPS arrival and departure procedures, and revise Class E airspace at Dillingham,
AK, to provide controlled airspace from 1200 feet AGL for recently developed IFR holding patterns.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. An automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) has been installed
at the Ukiah Municipal Airport meeting the criterion for a surface area. Controlled airspace extending from the surface
is needed for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Ukiah Municipal Airport. The area will be depicted on aeronautical
charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



History



On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. (59 FR 14805). An AWOS has been installed at the Ukiah Municipal Airport, Ukiah, CA. The
proposal was to modify controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and to add controlled airspace extending from
the surface for IFR operations at Ukiah Municipal Airport.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal.

The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraphs 6002 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).

The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.



The Rule



The amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes and amends Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. This
action modifies controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and establishes controlled airspace from the surface
for IFR operations at the Ukiah Municipal Airport at Ukiah, CA.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.


The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMS,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion



The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Quality Standards for Foods With No Identity Standards; Bottled Water


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the standard of quality regulation for bottled water to establish
an allowable level of 0.005 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for lead in bottled water. FDA also is retaining the existing
allowable level of 1.0 mg/L for copper in bottled water. This final rule will ensure both that the minimum quality of
bottled water with respect to copper and lead remains comparable to the quality of public drinking water, and that
bottled water will be free of any significant lead contamination. This final rule is consistent with FDA's goal of
reducing consumers' exposure to lead in drinking water to the extent practicable. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


Under section 410 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 349), whenever the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) prescribes interim or revised National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR's) under
section 1412 of the Public Health Service Act (The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) (42 U.S.C. 300f through 300j-9)),
FDA is required to consult with EPA and either amend its regulations for bottled drinking water ( 103.35(21
CFR 103.35)) or publish in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not making such amendments.
In the 

Federal Register

 of June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26460), EPA published a final rule promulgating NPDWR's that established corrosion control
treatment technique requirements for controlling lead and copper levels in public water systems when these contaminants
exceed levels of 0.015 mg/L for lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper in more than 10 percent of targeted tap samples. Targeted
tap water samples represent samples collected from residences most likely to have lead problems as a result of corrosion
in the distribution systems. EPA established treatment technique requirements rather than maximum contaminant
levels (MCL's) for lead and copper in drinking water because it believed that treatment technique requirements are
more appropriate to control contamination of lead and copper that is largely the result of circumstances beyond the
direct control of public water systems (i.e., corrosion in service lines not owned by the systems and in the plumbing
of residences and buildings). In addition, EPA established maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG's) of zero for
lead and 1.3 mg/L for copper which are based solely on considerations of protecting the public from the adverse health
effects of these contaminants in drinking water.
In accordance with section 410 of the act, FDA published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 5, 1993 (58 FR 389), a proposal to amend the quality standard for bottled water to establish an allowable
level of 0.005 mg/L for lead and to retain the existing allowable level of 1.0 mg/L for copper. FDA proposed a lower level
of 0.005 mg/L for lead in bottled water than EPA's level of 0.015 mg/L for lead in drinking water that triggers treatment
technique requirements. FDA's data showed that most bottlers do not normally experience the significant lead contamination
problems from corrosion of materials that are presented by public water distribution systems and residential plumbing
(e.g., pipes, faucets, and solder), and that bottlers can produce bottled water products with lead levels below 0.005
mg/L. Furthermore, this level represents the lowest level at which FDA can take enforcement action because it corresponds
to the practical quantitation limit (PQL) of the best available analytical methods for determining lead levels in
water. Finally, FDA noted that establishing the allowable level for lead at 0.005 mg/L would provide public health
protection at least equivalent to that provided by EPA's NPDWR and would ensure that bottled water products are free
of significant lead contamination.
With respect to the allowable level for copper, the existing allowable level of 1.0 mg/L in bottled water is below EPA's
MCLG of 1.3 mg/L and is equivalent to EPA's secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL), which is based on the aesthetic
effects of copper in drinking water. Thus, FDA proposed to retain the existing allowable level to ensure that levels
of copper in bottled water meet the safety and aesthetic criteria that EPA has established for copper in drinking water.

On November 8, 1990, the enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-535) removed
standard of quality rulemakings from the coverage of the formal rulemaking procedures in section 701(e) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 371(e)). FDA, therefore, proposed the amendments to the bottled water quality standard regulations for
lead and copper using notice and comment rulemaking under section 701(a) of the act. Interested persons were given
until March 8, 1993, to comment on the proposed regulation.


II. Summary of and Response to Comments


A. 

Summary of Comments




FDA received approximately 130 responses to the January 5, 1993, proposal. Each of these responses contained one
or more comments from industry, consumers, trade associations, Federal government officials, State government
agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, and a private research foundation. The comments generally supported
the proposal. Many comments addressed issues that are outside the scope of the proposal (e.g., allowable levels for
total trihalomethanes, chlorine, and fluoride in the quality standard for bottled water). These comments will not
be discussed here. A number of comments suggested modifications to, or were opposed to, various provisions of the
proposal. A summary of the suggested changes, the opposing comments, and the agency's responses follows.


B. 

Response to Comments




1. Most comments supported the proposed allowable levels of 0.005 mg/L for lead and 1.0 mg/L for copper in the quality
standard for bottled water. One comment, however, stated that the allowable level for lead in bottled water should
not be any lower than EPA's corrosion treatment trigger level of 0.015 mg/L for lead in drinking water because this
level corresponds to an average lead level of 0.005 mg/L, the level which most bottled waters do not exceed. The comment
argued that the fact that 0.005 mg/L is at the lower limit of reliable measurement for lead does not justify setting
a standard at that level. The comment further argued that setting a standard for lead in bottled water is not necessary
because lead content is not a problem in bottled water. The comment maintained that imposing regulations for the sake
of regulation is a problem because of the high costs incurred by diverting FDA resources from significant regulatory
concerns.
FDA disagrees with this comment. Under section 410 of the act, FDA's approach has been to respond to EPA's promulgation
of drinking water regulations under the SDWA by amending the quality standard for bottled water to maintain compatibility
with EPA's regulations. FDA concludes that amending the standard for lead in bottled water to 0.005 mg/L is fully compatible
and consistent with the EPA standard. 
Based on the available health effects information, EPA established an MCLG of zero for lead in drinking water. By adopting
this MCLG, EPA was in effect saying that if zero lead in drinking water can be achieved, it should be achieved. However,
EPA concluded that zero lead in public drinking water could not be achieved because of contamination of the water with
lead from corrosion of lead-containing materials in public water distribution systems and in residential plumbing.
To control this contamination, EPA established treatment technique requirements which are triggered when more
than 10 percent of the targeted tap water samples exceeds 0.015 mg/L for lead. 
 
Bottled water, however, generally does not have significant lead contamination problems. FDA conducted a survey
of bottled water in 1990 (Ref. 1), and the findings of that survey show that most bottlers are using source waters that
are free of significant lead contamination and can readily produce bottled water products with lead levels below
0.005 mg/L, the PQL for lead in water. Consequently, because this level, which is as close to EPA's MCLG of zero as possible,
is achievable in bottled water, there is no reason for FDA to rely on EPA's 0.015 mg/L trigger level in establishing
an allowable level for lead in bottled water. In fact, in its review and comment on FDA's proposal (before it published
in the 

Federal Register

), EPA stated that the regulatory approach taken by FDA to establish an allowable level of 0.005 mg/L for lead in bottled
water is consistent with the intent of the NPDWR for lead in public drinking water (Ref. 4).
2. One comment asserted that there is no safe threshold for lead in drinking water and, because technological resources
and knowledge make it feasible to measure lead in water at the 0.002 mg/L level, FDA should establish the allowable
level for lead in bottled water at that level. The comment contended that, because large water companies have been
testing for lead and reporting lead levels of 0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, and 0.004 mg/L to EPA, the PQL is substantially
lower than 0.005 mg/L. The comment stated that another organization, which has limited resources and is not in the
business of supplying water commercially, uses a laboratory that has found the PQL to be 0.002 mg/L when testing for
lead in bottled water. The comment further argued that EPA's PQL concept is theoretically inappropriate for safety
determinations because the error theory of laboratory measurements (i.e., the distinction between the standard
error of a single measurement and the standard error among a group of measurements) upon which EPA bases its determination
of the PQL is misleading. 
FDA disagrees that EPA's PQL concept is inappropriate. EPA's PQL is set at the lowest concentration for a contaminant
that laboratories certified by the States or by EPA for water analyses can reliably measure within specified limits
of precision and accuracy under routine laboratory operating conditions. EPA also determines the PQL based on the
method detection limit (MDL), which is defined as the lowest concentration of a substance that can be measured with
99 percent confidence that the true value is greater than zero. EPA generally sets the PQL at 5 to 10 times the MDL, depending
on the degree of health risk posed by a contaminant (for contaminants like lead that pose a high degree of health risk,
EPA sets the PQL at 5 times the MDL), and, if possible, confirms the PQL by interlaboratory performance evaluation
studies. 
Based on EPA's calculation of a 0.001 mg/L MDL for lead by the most sensitive analytical methods available, EPA set
the PQL for lead at 0.005 mg/L. EPA confirmed this level by performance evaluation studies that evaluated the ability
of EPA, State, and non-EPA and State laboratories to analyze water samples with low lead levels (56 FR 26460 at 26511,
June 7, 1991). 
Although the comment stated that a laboratory used by another organization found the PQL to be 0.002 mg/L for lead in
bottled water, it did not provide any data to support that laboratory's determination. Therefore, this comment has
not provided an adequate basis upon which to call into question EPA's PQL. 
In summary, based on the studies conducted by EPA establishing a PQL of 0.005 mg/L for lead in drinking water, FDA finds
that an allowable level of 0.005 mg/L for lead in the quality standard for bottled water is appropriate. 
3. Another comment stated that, although it strongly endorsed the proposed allowable level for lead in bottled water,
FDA should review this standard in a few years because EPA's 1991 rule for lead in drinking water has led to increased
analysis for lead in water, and, using the best available methodology, many laboratories can now routinely measure
lead levels at 0.001 or 0.002 mg/L in water samples. The comment maintained that measurement of lead in water at these
levels may soon be the standard, ``state of the art'' technology, and that it would be appropriate to set the allowable
level in bottled water at the limit of detection, i.e., 0.005 mg/L, or no detectable lead, whichever is less. 
FDA disagrees that establishing the allowable level for lead in bottled water at the limit of detection, i.e., 0.005
mg/L, or no detectable lead, whichever is less, is appropriate. As discussed above, 0.005 mg/L, the PQL for lead in
water, represents the lowest concentration that State- or EPA-certified laboratories for water analyses can reliably
measure within specified limits of precision and accuracy under routine laboratory operating conditions. FDA recognizes
that lead levels in water can be measured below 0.005 mg/L. However, to take an enforcement action based on level of
a contaminant in a food, FDA must be able to reliably establish the level of the contaminant in the food. EPA's PQL of
0.005 mg/L has been confirmed by performance evaluation studies as the lowest level of lead in water samples that can
be reliably and consistently measured (56 FR 26460 at 26511). Thus, FDA has concluded that reliance on the PQL as the
allowable level for lead in bottled water is appropriate. 
Nevertheless, FDA agrees that technology for analytical methodology is constantly advancing. Reliable measurement
of lead levels below 0.005 mg/L in water samples, within specified limits of precision and accuracy under routine
laboratory operating conditions, may soon become the general norm. Therefore, FDA agrees with the comment that within
the next few years, it should consult with EPA about reevaluating the PQL for lead in water. Moreover, FDA recognizes
that, should EPA revise the PQL, FDA will need to consider whether an allowable level for lead in bottled water below
0.005 mg/L is appropriate. 
 4. A State government agency and a majority of the comments from industry and trade associations opposed the statement
in the proposal that if the proposal becomes a final rule, bottlers will be required to test each lot of bottled water
to ensure that it contains less than 0.005 mg/L of lead. The comments argued that, because most bottlers are routinely
meeting the 0.005 mg/L standard for lead, a requirement for testing each lot of bottled water for lead is not necessary.
Furthermore, the majority of the comments argued that testing each lot of bottled water for lead would impose a significant
financial burden on the bottled water industry. For example, comments from two trade associations representing
bottled water manufacturers maintained that a requirement for testing each lot of bottled water for lead would impose
additional annual costs that they estimated at $15,000 for a small bottler and $300,000 for a large bottler.
Under the current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for the processing and bottling of bottled drinking
water (part 129 (21 CFR part 129)), bottlers are required to analyze, at least annually, for chemical contaminants,
including lead, in a representative sample from a batch or a segment of a continuous production run for each type of
bottled drinking water produced during a day's production ( 129.80(g)(2)). Therefore, bottlers will not
be required to test each lot of bottled water for the presence of lead. The statement that they would, which was inadvertently
included in the economic impact analysis, was in error. 
However, FDA reminds water bottlers that each lot of bottled water must comply with the quality standard for chemical
contaminants, and compliance with the minimum annual testing requirements of the CGMP does not exempt a firm from
regulatory action if any lot of bottled water does not meet any provision of the chemical quality standard.
5. Several comments recommended that testing for chemical contaminants (e.g., lead and copper) should be more frequent
than the required minimum of annual testing. One comment noted that, although FDA has established quality standards
for bottled water, it did not set any requirements for monitoring timeframes or submission of results to ensure that
bottlers meet the quality standards. Moreover, the comment objected to allowing distribution of a bottled water
product that is below the water quality standard, arguing that, given the emphasis on the quality of bottled water
verses tap water by the bottled water industry, bottlers are not likely to print a ``substandard'' statement on the
label. 
FDA agrees that bottlers are not likely to market bottled water that would be required to bear a statement of substandard
quality with respect to lead. However, FDA notes that the use of such a statement on the label of a food covered by a standard
of quality is specifically provided for by section 403(h)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(h)(1)), if that food falls below
the prescribed quality standard. Therefore, FDA cannot preclude the use of the statement of substandard quality.
Nonetheless,  103.35(g) provides that any bottled water containing a substance at a level considered injurious
to health under section 402 of the act (21 U.S.C. 342) is deemed to be adulterated and may be subject to regulatory action,
even if the bottled water bears a label statement of substandard quality.
FDA notes that the CGMP regulations for processing and bottling of bottled drinking water (part 129) require that
the water to be bottled be obtained from an approved source properly located, protected, and operated; be of a safe,
sanitary quality; and be in compliance at all times with the applicable laws and regulations of the government agency
or agencies having jurisdiction ( 129.35). In addition,  129.35(a) requires that samples of source
water be analyzed as often as necessary, but at least once each year, for chemical contaminants, and  129.80(g)
requires that each type of bottled water product be analyzed at least annually for chemical contaminants. Moreover,
 129.80(h) requires that records of the results for these tests be maintained at the plant for at least 2 years
and be available for official review at reasonable times. FDA is not aware of any data or other information that suggests
that requiring all bottlers to test for lead more frequently is necessary to ensure that bottled water is safe and of
acceptable quality. 
FDA emphasizes that water bottlers are responsible for ensuring, through appropriate manufacturing techniques
and sufficient quality control procedures, that all bottled water products introduced or delivered for introduction
into interstate commerce are safe, wholesome, and truthfully labeled, and that they comply with the provisions of
the quality standard. Therefore, should any bottler encounter circumstances that would warrant testing for lead
more frequently than once per year, the bottler is required to do such testing to ensure the safety and quality of the
bottled water. 
For the reasons stated above, FDA concludes that the testing requirements for contaminants in bottled water contained
in the CGMP regulations (part 129) are appropriate and sufficient to ensure the quality and safety of bottled water
products. Thus, the agency finds that revision of the CGMP regulations to require more frequent testing for chemical
contaminants in bottled water is not necessary at this time.
6. A majority of responses from industry opposed the exemption of mineral water from the lead standard for bottled
water. Another comment stated that the lead standard should apply to other types of bottled beverages, including
mineral water, soda water, and seltzer. 
Under the provisions of  103.35, the definition of ``bottled water'' excludes mineral water or any type of soft
drink commonly known as soda water. Consequently, these types of products are exempt from the provisions of the quality
standard for bottled water, including the allowable level for lead. However, in a proposal to establish a standard
of identity for bottled water (57 FR 393, January 5, 1993), FDA proposed to revise the definition for ``bottled water''
in the quality standard to include mineral water. Should FDA adopt that proposal, the allowable level of 0.005 mg/L
for lead will apply to mineral water. Even if the agency does not adopt this change, because of the health concerns raised
by lead, the agency is likely to take some action to regulate the level of lead in mineral water. 
In regard to soda water and seltzer, FDA considers these types of products to be soft drinks and not bottled water. Consequently,
they are not covered by regulations that address bottled water. The agency's reasons for considering these types
of products as soft drinks are fully discussed in its proposal to establish an identity standard for bottled water
(57 FR 393 at 395). Soft drinks are subject to regulatory action, however, if they contain a level of lead that may render
the food injurious to health. 
7. One comment from a trade association representing public water supply agencies recommended that FDA review the
latest EPA analytical techniques for determining lead and copper with respect to the use of nitric acid digestion
and incorporate this procedure as applicable. 
In accordance with FDA's responsibilities pursuant to section 410 of the act, FDA consulted with EPA by requesting
EPA's review and comment on the proposal to amend the quality standard for lead and copper in bottled water. In response,
EPA stated that FDA's regulatory approach for lead and copper in bottled water is consistent with the intent of EPA's
NPDWR's for lead and copper and concurred with the analytical methods that FDA cited for determining lead and copper
in bottled water (Ref. 4). Furthermore, in EPA Methods 200.7, 200.8, and 200.9, which FDA proposed to incorporate
by reference, the sample preparation procedures for measuring lead and copper as total recoverable metals call for
a nitric acid or nitric acid-hydrochloric acid digestion.


III. Conclusions


The agency is adopting the provisions concerning lead and copper in the quality standard for bottled water as proposed
(58 FR 389, January 5, 1993). The majority of the comments that the agency received supported the proposal. Furthermore,
after carefully considering the comments that the agency received that suggested modifications to, or were opposed
to, aspects of the proposal, the agency has determined that no changes are warranted. Therefore, upon the effective
date of this rule, November 21, 1994, any bottled water that contains an amount of lead or copper that exceeds the allowable
levels will be misbranded under section 403(h)(1) of the act unless the bottled water bears a statement of substandard
quality as provided by  103.35(f)(2)(ii). 
FDA has made one minor change concerning the analytical methods for the determination of lead and copper cited in new
 103.35(d)(3)(v). The sources for these methods will be the National Technical Information Services rather
than EPA. This change is consistent with the agency's practice of relying on readily available commercial sources
for incorporated materials when possible.


IV. Environmental Impact 


The agency previously considered the environmental effects of this rule, as announced in the proposed rule (58 FR
389, January 5, 1993). At that time, the agency concluded that the action would not have a significant impact on the
human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's environmental assessment
and finding of no significant impact for the proposal were displayed at the Dockets Management Branch at the time of
the proposal. FDA has received no new information or comments that would affect the agency's previous determination
that there is no significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required.


V. Analysis of Impacts 


FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because FDA has received no new information or comments that would alter its tentative
finding in the proposal that there is no substantive economic issue, the agency certifies that the final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

Margarine; Standard of Identity To Permit Use of Any Form of Oil of Marine Species Affirmed as GRAS or Approved as a Food
Additive for This Use


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the U.S. standard of identity for margarine to permit the use of
any form of oil of marine species that has been affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or approved as a food
additive for this use. This action is in response to a petition submitted by the National Fish Meal and Oil Association
(NFMOA). FDA believes that this action will provide increased flexibility to manufacturers in the selection of lipid
ingredients in margarine and will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest of consumers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. The Proposal


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 30, 1990 (55 FR 35439), FDA published a proposal based on a petition from NFMOA, 1525 Wilson Blvd., suite 500,
Arlington, VA 22209, to amend the U.S. standard of identity for margarine ( 166.110 (21 CFR 166.110)) to permit
the use of any form of marine oil that has been affirmed as GRAS or approved as a food additive for this use as an additional
optional edible fat or oil ingredient in margarine. Interested persons were given until October 29, 1990, to submit
comments.


II. The Tentative Final Rule


The NFMOA petition was filed under section 701(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 371(e)),
which requires formal rulemaking in any action for the amendment of a food standard. However, in November 1990, the
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-535) was signed into law, and it removed food standard
rulemaking proceedings, except for actions for the amendment or repeal of food standards of identity for dairy products
or maple sirup, from the formal rulemaking proceedings of section 701(e) of the act. Therefore, further action on
the NFMOA petition would be subject to the informal notice and comment rulemaking proceedings of section 701(a) of
the act. Thus, the agency published a tentative final rule in the 

Federal Register

 of August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43580), under those procedures. Because there had been an opportunity to comment on the proposal
when it was published in 1990, the comment period on that tentative final rule was 30 days.


III. Comments


FDA received one comment in response to the tentative final rule. This comment, submitted by the petitioner, expressed
support for the rule and urged the agency to finalize the rule as soon as possible. NFMOA also stated that it would like
to make clear for the record that its petition did not ask FDA to approve the use of any form of marine oil but was instead
restricted to ``any safe and suitable form of menhaden oil.'' The comment stated that, nevertheless, it had no objection
to FDA's enlargement of the range of oils to be permitted by the amended regulation, from menhaden oil to marine oil,
provided that this change does not result in any further delay in the rulemaking proceeding.
The agency acknowledges that the petitioner only sought to provide for safe and suitable forms of menhaden oil in margarine.
However, FDA believes that it is appropriate to provide for oil of any marine species where such oil has been affirmed
as GRAS or approved as a food additive for this use. The broader provision in the standard of identity will eliminate
the need to amend the standard of identity for margarine should other oils of marine species be found to be safe and suitable
for use in this food. FDA also notes that ingredient labeling will inform consumers of the presence of such oils when
used in margarine.
Therefore, having received no adverse comments, the agency is revising the margarine standard as proposed in the
tentative final rule. The agency believes that providing for optional oils of marine species that have been affirmed
as GRAS or listed as a food additive for this use will increase manufacturers' options in the selection of oil ingredients
for margarine and will provide for a wider variety of margarine products in the marketplace. Thus, the agency concludes
that the proposed change in the standard of identity for margarine will promote honesty and fair dealing in the interest
of consumers.
Accordingly, after consideration of the comments, the agency is issuing this final rule to amend the standard of identity
for margarine in  166.110 as set forth below.


IV. Economic Impact


FDA has examined the economic implications of this final rule to amend the standard of identity for margarine in 21
CFR part 166 as required by Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354).
E.O. 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health, and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires
that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
In the August 17, 1993, tentative final rule, FDA announced that it had analyzed the economic impact of the new provision
that FDA is adopting under the previous E.O. 12291 and found that it would not have a significant impact. E.O. 12291
compelled agencies to use cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The agency also tentatively concluded
in the August 30, 1990, proposal that this action would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Manufacturers may continue to produce margarine using current formulations. Thus, no
changes are required in formulations unless manufacturers wish to reformulate their products. FDA has received
no new information or comments that would alter its tentative finding that there is no substantive economic issue
in this rulemaking. Thus, FDA concludes that this is not a major rule as defined by E.O. 12291, nor is it a significant
rule as defined by E.O. 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.


V. Environmental Impact


In the preamble to the August 30, 1990, proposed rule, FDA reported its finding that this action qualified for categorical
exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(1) and that neither an environmental assessment (EA) nor an environmental impact
statement was required. As noted in the tentative final rule, FDA received one comment on the proposed rule that claimed
that this action would result in increased fishing pressure that could adversely affect the menhaden fishery, and
that the agency had not considered this potential impact prior to issuing the proposed rule. Although the comment
did not provide evidence to support the contention that the menhaden fishery would be adversely affected, FDA requested
an EA from the petitioner. The decision to ask for an EA takes into consideration the agency's assessment of this issue
as part of its previous action to affirm partially hydrogenated menhaden oil and hydrogenated menhaden oil as GRAS
for use as edible fats or oils (54 FR 38219, September 15, 1989). The agency also has information indicating that the
market for menhaden oil as a component of margarine is large, approximately 40 million pounds per year.
Based on information in the petitioner's EA submitted for the current action and on the agency's analysis of the reports
on the menhaden fisheries issued subsequent to FDA approval of GRAS petition (GRASP 6G0316 (54 FR 38219)), FDA concluded
in the August 17, 1993, tentative final rule that the proposed action would not have a significant impact on the menhaden
fishery. Amending the margarine standard of identity will not increase the volume of crude menhaden oil that is produced.
The only change will be that crude menhaden oil will more often be retained in the United States for further processing
into food grade products, instead of being shipped to Europe and elsewhere for this same use.
Thus, FDA carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action, including the effects on the
menhaden fishery and concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that
an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact, and the evidence
supporting that finding, which includes the petitioner's EA, the finding of no significant impact for FDA's approval
of GRASP 6G0316 (54 FR 38219), and a copy of ``National Marine Fisheries Service Final Purse-seine Landings of Gulf
and Atlantic Menhaden in the 1990 and 1991 Fishing Seasons'' have been placed on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be
seen by interested persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
The agency has not received any additional information that would cause it to revise its finding of no significant
impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement
is required.

Antibiotic Drugs; Cefotetan and Cefotetan Sodium Injection



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of
accepted standards for a new bulk form of cefotetan, cefotetan, and for its use in a new dosage form of cefotetan sodium,
cefotetan sodium injection. The manufacturer has supplied sufficient data and information to establish its safety
and efficacy.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefotetan,
cefotetan, and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefotetan sodium, cefotetan sodium injection. The agency has
concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its
safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442
to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
June 24, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before June 24, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before June 24, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before July 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

Tests and methods of assay

_(1) 

Potency

. Proceed as directed in  436.216 of this chapter, except use the resolution test solution to determine resolution
in lieu of the working standard solution. Perform the assay at ambient temperature, using an ultraviolet detection
system operating at a wavelength of 254 nanometers, a column packed with microparticulate (3 to 10 micrometers in
diameter) reversed phase packing material such as octadecyl hydrocarbon bonded silicas, a flow rate not exceeding
2.0 milliliters per minute, and a known injection volume of between 10 and 20 microliters. Reagents, working standard
solution, sample solution, resolution test solution, system suitability requirements, and calculations are as
follows:
(i) 

 Reagents

_(A) 

Diluting solution

. Mix water:methanol:acetonitrile (90:5:5).
(B) 

Mobile phase

. Mix 0.1

M

 phosphoric acid:glacial acetic acid:methanol:acetonitrile (1700:100:105:105). Filter through a suitable filter
capable of removing particulate matter greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. Degas the mobile phase just prior to its
introduction into the chromatograph.
(ii) 

 Preparation of working standard, sample, and resolution test solutions

_(A) 

Working standard solution

. Accurately weigh approximately 50 milligrams of the cefotetan working standard into a 250-milliliter volumetric
flask containing 12.5 milliliters of methanol. Swirl the flask for several minutes, then add 12.5 milliliters of
acetonitrile. Swirl the flask until the cefotetan is dissolved. Dilute to volume with water to obtain a solution containing
approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter. Mix well. Protect the working standard solution from
light.
(B) 

Sample solution

. Dissolve an accurately weighed portion of the sample with sufficient diluting solution described in paragraph
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section to obtain a concentration of approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter.
(C) 

Resolution test solution

. Place 10 milliliters of the working standard solution in a stoppered flask containing a few milligrams of magnesium
carbonate. Close the flask and sonicate for 10 minutes. If the solution is not slightly turbid, add more magnesium
carbonate and repeat sonication. Filter the turbid solution through a 0.5-micron filter and use within 2 hours. As
this solution stands, the tautomer concentration increases.
(iii) 

 System suitability requirements

_(A) 

Tailing factor

. The tailing factor (

T

) is satisfactory if it is not more than 1.3 at 10 percent of peak height in lieu of 5 percent of peak height. 
(B) 

Efficiency of the column

. The efficiency of the column (

n

) is satisfactory if it is greater than 1,500 theoretical plates.
(C) 

Resolution

. The resolution (

R

) between the peak for cefotetan and its tautomer is satisfactory if it is not less than 2.0.
(D) 

Coefficient of variation

. The coefficient of variation (

S



r

 in percent) of five replicate injections is satisfactory if it is not more than 2.0 percent. If the system suitability
requirements have been met, then proceed as described in  436.216(b) of this chapter. Alternate chromatographic
conditions are acceptable provided comparable system suitability requirements are met. However, the sample preparation
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section should not be changed.
(iv)

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co. The supplemental NADA provides for oral
administration of fenbendazole suspension to goats as an anthelmintic. The regulations are also amended to establish
a tolerance for drug residues in edible goat tissues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., Rt. 202-206 North, Somerville, NJ 08876, filed a supplemental NADA 128-620
that provides for oral administration of a suspension containing 10 percent fenbendazole to nonlactating goats
for removal and control of stomach and intestinal worms 

Haemonchus contortus

 and 

Ostertagia circumcincta

. Also, a tolerance for residues of fenbendazole and its metabolites in edible goat tissues is established. Approval
is based in part on data and information in Public Master File (PMF) 5118 established under the Interregional Research
Project No. 4 (IR-4), Northcentral Region, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824.


The supplement is approved as of April 25, 1994, and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 520.905a and 556.275 to reflect
the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. Additionally, the regulations
for tolerances and safe concentrations for residues of the drug or its metabolites in cattle and swine are editorially
revised to remove any reference to safe concentrations because they are irrelevant for residue monitoring purposes.
In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and  514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21
CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval
of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii), this
approval does not qualify for marketing exclusivity because no new clinical or field investigations (other than
bioequivalence or residue studies) and no new human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies)
essential to approval of the supplement were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish a tolerance for residues of the pesticide befentrhin,
(2-methyl [1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)methyl-3-(2-chloro-3,3,3,-trifluoro-1-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate,
in or on the raw agricultural commodity dried hops at 10.0 parts per million (ppm). 


There were no requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. 
One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The comment, which was submitted by E.I. duPont de Nemours
& Co., Inc. (Dupont), responded to the Agency's request for comments on the reclassification of dried hops as
a raw agricultural commodity. The commenter expressed DuPont's support for the reclassification of all dried fruits
as raw agricultural commodities. EPA is currently reviewing a petition from DuPont requesting the revocation of
the tolerance established under section 409 of the FFDCA for residues of the fungicide benomyl in raisins and the establshment
of a tolerance for benomyl on raisins under section 408 of the FFDCA. DuPont's petition contends that existing section
409 tolerances for raisins are inappropriate since raisins meet the statutory definition of a raw agricultural commodity.
Additional information regarding DuPont's petition can be obtained from the notice of receipt for the petition,
which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63575, Dec. 2, 1993). An evaluation by EPA of the commenter's proposed reclassification
of dried fruit (including raisins) as a raw agricultural commodity was not conducted by EPA in association with the
IR-4 petition for tolerance for bifentrhin residues on hops. EPA will respond to DuPont's proposed recalssification
of raisins in association with the benomyl petition, which is under evaluation by the Agency. 
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public
health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Pesticide Tolerances for Clofentezine 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule establishes tolerances for residues of the insecticide clofentezine in or on the following raw agricultural
commodities: peaches, nectarines, almonds, walnuts, apricots and cherries and for clofentezine and its metabolite
3-(2-cloro-4-hydroxphenyl)-6-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine in or on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of
cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep and milk. Nor-Am Chemical Co. requested this regulation to establish maximum
permissible levels for residues of the insecticide.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued rules, published in the 

Federal Registers

 of June 28, 1990 (55 FR 26438), May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22333), and June 12, 1991 (56 FR 26911), which announced that Nor-Am
Chemical Co. had submitted pesticide petitions (PP 9F3699, 9F3793, and 9F3799) to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish tolerances
for clofentezine in or on peaches at 1.0 part per million (ppm) and nectarines at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3699); almond hulls at
5.00 ppm, almond nutmeat at 0.5 ppm, walnuts at 0.02 ppm (PP 9F3793); apricots at 1.0 ppm and cherries at 1.0 ppm (PP 9F3799).
The Agency established these tolerances with an expiration date of September 30, 1994, to cover residues expected
to be present from use during the period of conditional registration for these uses. The conditional registrations
were to expire September 30, 1993. The Agency recently extended the conditional registration expiration date to
December 31, 1994.


The conditional registration required the following information to be submitted. These studies were required because
the chronic risk of clofentezine to avian and aquatic species could not be fully evaluated.

1. Avian reproduction studies (bobwhite quail and mallard duck) were required to be repeated.

2. Two aquatic studies, an aquatic invertebrate life-cycle study and a fish life-cycle study, were required.

Studies have been submitted and are currently in review, but a final review is not expected to be completed for some
time. However, the Agency has conducted a preliminary review of these studies and determined that they are scientifically
sound. Therefore, on the basis of Nor-Am's compliance with the requirements of the conditional registration, the
Agency is removing the expiration date for the tolerances of the commodities listed above. In the interim, until the
Agency is able to complete its final review and risk assessment a conditional registration will remain in effect for
the commodities listed above.
In the 

Federal Register

 of February 9, 1994 (58 FR 42728), the Agency announced receipt of a petition from Nor-Am Chemical Co. requesting to
make the tolerances permanent for residues on peaches, nectarines, almonds, walnuts, apricots, and cherries and
in or on meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep. No comments were received in response
to this notice of filing. As described above, the Agency has decided to remove the expiration date for these tolerances
based on Nor-Am's submittal of the studies requested in the conditional registration.
Based on the 1-year dog-feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day and using a safety factory of 100, the acceptable
daily intake (ADI) for humans is 0.013 mg/kg of body weight/day. The current action will contribute .0000519 mg/kg/day
of residue to the human diet utilizing an additional 4.0 percent the ADI. This results in a total utilization of 4.5
percent of the ADI. 
The scientific data submitted in the petitions and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in previous final rules establishing tolerances
for clofentezine referenced earlier in this document, i.e., the 

Federal Registers

 of June 28, 1990 (55 FR 26438), May 15, 1991 (56 FR 22333), and June 12, 1991 (56 FR 26911).
The nature of residue is understood. An adequate analytical method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
is available for enforcement. There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this
chemical. This pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect
the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objection and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the feed prescribed by 40
CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which
a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor or the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary: and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 17.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that the rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 12, 1988 (53 FR 39783), which announced that the Ciba-Geigy Corp., P.O. Box 18300, Greensboro, NC 27419,
had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8F3654) to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.434 by establishing tolerances
for the fungicide 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound,
in or on the commodities peanuts at 0.2 ppm, peanut hay at 20.0 ppm, and peanut hulls at 1.0 ppm. The were no adverse comments
received by the Agency in response to the notice of filing.


Because the above notice published more than 5 years ago, it was republished in the 

Federal Register

 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14853). There were no adverse comments received by the Agency in response to the republication
of the notice of filing.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant materials have been evaluated. The data considered include
the following:
1. Plant and animal metabolism studies.
2. Residue data for crop and livestock commodities.
3. Two enforcement methods and multiresidue method testing data.
4. A rat oral lethal dose (LD

50

) of 1,517 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) of body weight.
5. A 90-day rat feeding study with a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 12 mg/kg/day.
6. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day.
7. A rabbit developmental toxicity study with a maternal NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day and a developmental toxicity NOEL of
greater than 400 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested (HDT)).
8. A rat teratology study with a maternal toxicity NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day and a developmental toxicity NOEL of 30 mg/kg/day.
9. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a reproductive NOEL of 125 mg/kg/day (HDT) and a developmental toxicity
NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day.
10. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 1.25 mg/kg/day.
11. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day with no carcinogenic potential
under the conditions of the study up to and including approximately 125 mg/kg, the highest dose tested.
12. A 2-year mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with a NOEL of 15 mg/kg/day and with a statistically significant
increase in combined adenomas and carcinomas of the liver in male mice at approximately 375 mg/kg/day, the highest
dose tested.
13. Ames test with and without activation, negative.
14. A mouse dominant-lethal assay, negative.
15. Chinese hamster nucleus anomaly, negative.
16. Cell transformation assay, negative.
Data gaps exist concerning dosing in the mouse carcinogenicity study. These data requirements were required under
reregistration, pursuant to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.
As part of EPA's evaluation of potential human health risks, propiconazole has been the subject of five Peer Reviews
and one Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) meeting.
Propiconazole was originally evaluated by the Peer Review Committee on January 15, 1987, and classified as a Group
C (possible human) carcinogen with a recommendation made for the quantification of estimated potential human risk
using a linearized low-dose extrapolation. The method resulted in the establishment of a Q

*

 of 7.9 X 10

-2

 (mg/kg/day)

-1

.
The Peer Review Committee's decision was presented to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel on March 2, 1988. The Panel
did not concur with the committee's overall assessment of the weight-of-evidence on the carcinogenicity of propiconazole.
The Panel recommended placing the chemical in Group D, indicating that the Group C classification was based on minimal
evidence. The Panel's determination that EPA's Group C classification was based on minimal evidence was due to the
fact that the incidence of liver tumors in male mice only occurred when the mice were given an excessive chemical dose.
In the second, third, and fourth Peer Reviews that followed, the Peer Review Committee considered recommendations
of the SAP as well as rebuttals by the registrant. Its conclusion, however, that propiconazole should be classified
as a Group C carcinogen with a quantification of potential human risk remained unchanged.
As part of a fifth Peer Review, EPA considered additional information provided by the registrant in support of the
registrant's argument that the high dose was excessively toxic in the mouse carcinogenicity study. It further argued
that the data from the high dose (2,500 ppm) should not be included in the evaluation of carcinogenic potential of propiconazole.
In support of these arguments, the registrant provided two subchronic oral toxicity studies in mice. Ciba-Geigy
also provided a reread of the pathology slides from a mouse oncogenicity study which it felt indicated sufficient
concurrent liver toxicity at 2,500 ppm to document that this dose was excessive. These findings were not present in
the original pathology report. Owing to the inconsistency in Ciba-Geigy's report and the original report, the Agency
requested that an independent (third) evaluation of the pathology slides be made to determine if the pathology reported
could be confirmed. The results of this (third) pathology evaluation were used in the fifth Peer Review in place of
data resulting from the earlier evaluations provided by Ciba-Geigy.
The Peer Review Committee considered the following facts regarding the toxicology data on propiconazole in a weight-of-evidence
determination of carcinogenic potential:
1. Increased numbers of adenomas (increased trend and pairwise comparison) were found in the livers of male CD1 mice
given 2,500 ppm of propiconazole in the diet.
2. The treated animals had earlier fatalities than the controls.
3. The numbers of carcinomas were increased (trend only) in male mice only at the 2,500 ppm dose level. Tumors were not
significantly increased at the 500 ppm dose level. Adenomas observed in the treated animals were larger and more numerous
than those in controls; however, the tumor type (adenoma) was the same.
4. No excessive number of tumors was found in female mice.
5. In a rat study conducted with acceptable doses of propiconazole, no excessive numbers of tumors were found.
The Peer Review Committee determined, based on the additional information submitted by Ciba-Geigy from two 90-day
subchronic studies in mice that the 2,500-ppm dose used in the 2-year chronic study exceeded the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) based on the endpoint of hepatic necrosis, and the 500-ppm dose used in the chronic study was inadequate
to assess the carcinogenicity of propiconazole. Based on the third pathology evaluation of the chronic study, the
Peer Review Committee agreed with Ciba-Geigy's argument that the study showed excessive toxicity at the 2,500 ppm-dose
and concluded that the 90-day subchronic studies are a better measure of what would be an MTD.
Based upon these findings, the Peer Review Committee agreed that the classification for propiconazole should remain
a Group C (possible human) carcinogen and recommended against the previously used Q

*

 (

viz

. 0.079) for risk assessment purposes. For the purpose of risk characterization the Peer Review Committee recommended
that the reference dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk. This decision was based on
the disqualification of the high dose (2,500 ppm), making the data inappropriate for the calculation of Q

*

. Because the middle dose (500 ppm) was not considered sufficiently high enough for assessing the carcinogenetic
potential of propiconazole, EPA has requested an additional mouse study at intermediate dose levels in male mice
only. EPA does not expect that these data will significantly change the above cancer assessment that propiconazole
poses a negligible cancer risk to humans.

The reference dose (RfD) for propiconazole is 0.013 mg/kg/day, based on a no-observable-effect level (NOEL) of 1.25
mg/kg/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 1-year feeding study in dogs which demonstrated
as an effect irritation of the stomach in males.

The Agency has evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues based on the proposed tolerances and the commodities
which have established tolerances using data on anticipated residues and percent crop treated data. The livestock
burden was calculated using anticipated residues in feed items multiplied by the expected percent contribution
to the diet. This dietary burden was then compared with available data from feeding studies to determine anticipated
residues in meat and milk. Based on current registered uses of this chemical only 7% of the RfD is being utilized for
the general U.S. population. The tolerances are expected to elicit only a minor increase in the percent utilization
of the RfD for the general U.S. population. The most highly exposed subgroups, nursing and nonnursing infants less
than 1 year, have Anticipated Residue Contributions (ARCs) from all published tolerances of 1.97 X 10

-3

 and 3.97 X 10

-3

 mg/kg bwt/day. These ARCs represent 15% and 31% of the Reference Dose for these subgroups, respectively. The proposed
tolerances will add 0.03% and 0.05% of the RfD for nursing and nonnursing infants less than 1 year, respectively.
Available data on storage stability of propiconazole in peanuts are unacceptable and must be redone for nutmeat,
hulls, and hay. Once review of all required residue data is submitted, the petitioner may resubmit its petition for
permanent tolerances.

The nature of the residue in plants and animals is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (gas chromatography)
are available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time for establishing these tolerances and food
additive regulations to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II,
the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement
when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), 401 M St., S.W.,
Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1128C, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington,
VA 22202, (703)-305-5232.
The pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for which the tolerances are being sought. For the reasons described
above, the Agency is establishing tolerances for residues of 1-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-propyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl]methyl]-1

H

-1,2,4-triazole and its metabolites, determined as 2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid and expressed as parent compound,
in or on the following raw agricultural commodities: peanuts, 0.2 ppm; peanut hay, 20 ppm; peanut hulls, 1 ppm. Because
of unacceptable storage stability data on peanuts, the Agency is placing a time limitation on these tolerances. However,
based on available data the Agency concludes that the established interim tolerances will protect public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25).
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such
issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.127). A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or
raising tolerance levels or food additive regulations or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to
this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Under section 3(f),
the order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual
effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities
(also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering
with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement,
grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the

Methyl Vinyl Ether-Maleic Acid Copolymer and Methy Vinyl Ether-Maleic Acid Copolymer Calcium Sodium Salt; Tolerance
Exemption




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of methy vinyl ether-maleic
acid copolymer calcium sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) when used as inert ingredients (dispersant and seed-coating
adhesive, respectively) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, raw agricultural commodities after
harvest, or animals. This regulation was requested by International Specialty Products. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14820), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products,
1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted pesticide petitions (PPs) 3E4260 and 3E4261 to EPA requesting that the
Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e),
propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) and (e) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues
of methyl vinyl ether-maleic acid copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 25153-40-6) (PP 3E4260) and methyl vinyl ether-maleic
acid copolymer calcium sodium salt (CAS Reg. No. 62386-95-2) (PP 3E4261) when used as inert ingredients
(dispersant and seed-coating adhesive, respectively) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, to raw
agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemptions will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemptions are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

for residues of the herbicide in or on the raw agricultural commodities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14824), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that pursuant to petitions by the Acetochlor
Registration Partnership (formed by Monsanto Co. and Zeneca Ag. Products (see the 

Federal Register

 of March 23, 1994 (13655))) under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, it was proposed
to establish tolerances for residues of the herbicide acetochlor (2-chloro-2`-methyl-6-ethyl-

N

-ethoxymethyl acetanilide) and its metabolites containing the ethyl methyl aniline (EMA) moiety and the hydroxyethyl
methyl aniline (HEMA) moiety, to be analyzed as acetochlor, and expressed as acetochlor equivalents, in or on the
raw agricultural commodities (RACs) wheat grain at 0.02 ppm and sorghum grain at 0.02 ppm.


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available

taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's

Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing

AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule with comment period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule updates Medicare regulations to conform them to certain self-implementing provisions on coverage of services
and payment requirements under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93). OBRA 93 was enacted on August
10, 1993 and several of the cited changes to the statute are already in effect and the others will be shortly. We are also
implementing a related provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) as necessary for consistency
and clarity of the OBRA 93 provisions. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93) (Pub. L. 103-66) was enacted. This
law contains numerous provisions relating to coverage of services and payments for services furnished to Medicare
beneficiaries. Some of these provisions are self-implementing; that is, the provisions are stated in terms that
neither require nor permit exercise of discretion in implementing them. 
The plain wording of the law causes a conflict with several of our existing regulations; in other cases, the regulations
simply do not take the amendments into account. We are, therefore, making the necessary changes to incorporate the
new provisions into regulations. 
A discussion of the individual legislative provisions and the accompanying regulations follows. 


II. Reductions in Payments for Skilled Nursing Facility Services_Elimination of Return on Equity for Proprietary
Skilled Nursing Facilities 


A. Legislative Provision


Section 1861(v)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides that proprietary skilled nursing facilities
(SNFs) receive, in addition to payments for the costs of providing services, return on equity payments, which provide
the investors in the facilities a return on their investment equivalent to what they would have earned had they invested
the same amount in specified government securities. Section 13503(c) of OBRA 93 amended sections 1861(v)(1)(B)
and 1878(f)(2) of the Act to eliminate payments to SNFs for return on equity capital, applicable to portions of cost
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. 


B. Regulations Revision


We are revising  413.157(b)(3), Rate of return related to proprietary SNFs, to limit its application to services
furnished before October 1, 1993. 


III. Reductions in Payments for Hospice Services 


A. Legislative Provision


Under section 1814(i) of the Act, we pay for hospice services on a daily rate basis. Payments are adjusted by a market
basket percentage increase. Section 13504 of OBRA 93 amended section 1814(i) of the Act to decrease the amount of the
market basket (as defined by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act) percentage increase that will be applied in fiscal
years (FY) 1994 through 1997. These decreases are: 
FY 1994_the market basket percentage increase minus 2 percentage points; 
FYs 1995 and 1996_the market basket percentage increase minus 1.5 percentage points; and 
FY 1997_the market basket percentage increase minus .5 percentage points. 
After FY 1997, the full market basket percentage increase will again apply. 



B. Regulations Revisions


We are revising  418.306, Determination of payment rates, by updating paragraph (b)(2) to exclude FYs 1994
through 1997 from the application of the market basket percentage increase without modification and to add a new paragraph
(b)(3) to add the statutory decreases. 


IV. Reduction in Part A Premium for Certain Individuals With 30 or More Quarters of Social Security Coverage 


A. Legislative Provision 


Under section 226(a) of the Act, individuals generally become entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A when they
reach age 65 based on hospital insurance (Part A) taxes they paid under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
while they were working. By paying the Part A portion of the FICA tax, individuals acquire quarters of coverage (QCs),
which are used to insure them for Part A coverage. Insured individuals are not required to pay monthly premiums for
Part A coverage. Under section 1818 of the Act, individuals age 65 or over who do not have enough QCs to be insured for
premium-free Part A may enroll in the Part A program if they pay a monthly premium. The Part A premium is determined under
section 1818(d) of the Act and is based on the actuarial value of benefits under Part A. In addition, under section 1818A
of the Act, disabled individuals who lose eligibility for premium-free Part A solely because they have returned to
work may enroll in Part A if they pay a monthly premium, the amount of which is determined under section 1818(d). 
Section 13508 of OBRA 93 amended section 1818(d) to reduce, on a phased-in basis, the amount of the Part A premium for
workers with 30 or more QCs and for spouses (including surviving spouses) of these workers with 30 or more QCs after
having been married at least one year. The reduction also applies to divorced spouses (including surviving divorced
spouses) of workers with 30 or more QCs provided that, at the time the divorce became final, the worker had 30 or more
QCs and the marriage had lasted for at least 10 years. The reductions are as follows: 



1994_25 percent 
1995_30 percent 
1996_35 percent 
1997_40 percent 
1998 and later years_45 percent 



The reduction will begin with premium payments beginning January 1994.

B. Regulations Revisions


We are adding to  406.32, Monthly premiums, a new paragraph (b)(3) to show the year by year reductions required
by the statute and a new paragraph (c) to show the requirements for qualifying for the reduction. We are redesignating
paragraph (b)(3) as (b)(4) and revising its contents, which concern rounding off fractions of dollars, to specify
that the paragraph applies to the unreduced and the reduced Part A premium. We are redesignating current paragraphs
(c) through (f) as (d) through (g), respectively. 


V. Extension of 10 Percent Reduction in Payments for Capital-Related Costs of Outpatient Hospital Services 


A. Legislative Provision 


Under 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I) of the Act, Medicare pays the capital costs of hospitals allocated to outpatient departments
on the basis of reasonable cost principles, subject to a 10 percent reduction through FY 1995. (Sole community hospitals
and rural primary care hospitals are exempt from these reductions.) Section 13521 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(I)
of the Act to extend the 10 percent reduction through FY 1998. 


B. Regulations Revisions


We are revising  413.130(j)(1)(ii), Reduction to capital-related costs, to extend to 1998 the year through
which the 10 percent reduction applies. 


VI. Extension of Reduction in Payments for Other Costs for Outpatient Hospital Services 


A. Legislative Provision


Under section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act, Medicare payments for hospital outpatient services made on a reasonable
cost basis and the cost portion of outpatient services paid on the basis of a blended amount are both reduced by 5.8 percent
through FY 1995. Section 13522 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(v)(1)(S)(ii)(II) of the Act to extend the application
of the reduction through FY 1998. 


B. Regulations Revisions


We are revising  413.124, Reduction to hospital outpatient operating costs, to extend to 1998 the year through
which the 5.8 percent reductions apply. 


VII. Reduction in Payments for Intraocular Lenses 


A. Legislative Provision


Section 1833(i)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act includes in the cost of surgery to insert an intraocular lens during or after
cataract surgery a payment that is reasonable and related to the cost of acquiring the class of lens involved. Section
4151 of Public Law 101-508 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90)) froze the amount of payment
for the lens at $200. Section 13533 of OBRA 93 reduced the payment amount for intraocular lenses inserted during or
after cataract surgery in an ambulatory surgical center on or after January 1, 1994 and before January 1, 1999. For
that period, the payment is $150. 


B. Regulations Revisions


Our regulations do not contain the specific amounts allowable for intraocular lenses, which are, instead, contained
in our administrative guidelines. Therefore, we are making no changes to regulations to implement the legislation.



VIII. Payment for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrients, Supplies and Equipment During 1994 and 1995 


A. Legislative Provision


In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-509), section 9340 provided that reasonable
charges for parenteral and enteral nutrition supplies and equipment may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which
the supplies and equipment are widely and consistently available. Under our regulations at 42 CFR 405.511(c) those
levels are set at the 25th percentile of the charges for the items or services, in the locality designated by the carrier
for this purpose, during the three month period of July 1 through September 30 preceding the fee screen year for which
the item or service was furnished. Section 13541 of OBRA 93 requires that in determining the amount of Part B payment
for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment during 1994 and 1995, the charges determined to be reasonable
with respect to these items may not exceed the charges determined to be reasonable for them during 1993. 


B. Regulation Revision


As our payment regulations do not specifically address payments for parenteral and enteral nutrients, supplies
and equipment, we do not need to revise our regulations to implement this provision of OBRA 93 but will make any necessary
changes in our program manuals. 


IX. Increase in Annual Cap on Amount of Medicare Payment for Outpatient Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy
Services 


A. Legislative Provision


Section 1833(g) of the Act limits the amount payable annually for covered outpatient physical and occupational therapy
services provided by independently practicing physical and occupational therapists. Section 6133(a) of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation of 1989 (OBRA 89) (Pub. L. 101-239) amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the
maximum amount of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $500 to $750, for services furnished
on or after January 1, 1990, and section 13555 of OBRA 93 amended section 1833(g) of the Act to increase the maximum amount
of incurred expenses that can be recognized for payment purposes from $750 to $900, effective for services furnished
on or after January 1, 1994. 


B. Regulations Revisions


We are revising paragraph (c)(2) of 42 CFR 410.60, Outpatient physical therapy services: Conditions, to show the
various caps since before 1982 through 1994 for physical therapy services furnished by independent physical therapists.
There is currently no corresponding regulation section for occupational therapy but we will include the $900 cap
when we publish final regulations on those services.

X. Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 



A. Legislative Provision 



Under section 1861(aa) of the Act, Medicare pays for services furnished in certain qualified health centers that
are known as Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Each center is: An entity that is receiving a grant under
section 329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act or is under contract with the recipient of a grant under section
329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act and meets the requirements for receiving such a grant; or is determined,
based on the recommendations of the Health Resources and Services Administration within the Public Health Service,
to meet the requirements for meeting such a grant; or was treated by the Secretary as a comprehensive Federally funded
health center as of January 1, 1990. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(aa)(4) of the Act to include as FQHCs
outpatient programs and facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination
Act (25 U.S.C. 450). The amendment took effect as if included in the enactment of section 4161(a)(2)(C) of OBRA 90,
which was effective October 1, 1991. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 also provides that an outpatient health program or facility
operated by an urban Indian organization receiving funds under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25
U.S.C. 1601ff) is included in the Medicare program, effective October 1, 1991. 



B. Regulations Revision



We are adding a new paragraph to the definition of Federally qualified health centers in  405.2401(b) to include
outpatient health programs and facilities operated by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination Act or
by urban Indian organizations under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 



XI. Reduction in Payments for Epoetin 



A. Legislation 



Medicare is the principle purchaser of epoetin (EPO), an anti-anemia drug used by dialysis patients with a specified
level of anemia. Section 1881(b)(11)(B) of the Act provides that payments to ESRD facilities are made based on increments
of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units, with a maximum payment of $11 per 1,000 units. Under section 1861(s)(2)(P)
of the Act, Medicare considers as a medical or other health service EPO for home dialysis patients competent to use
the drug in the home without medical or other supervision, subject to methods and standards established by the Secretary
by regulation for the safe and effective use of the drug, and items related to the use of the drug. 

Section 13566 of OBRA 93 decreased the maximum payment for EPO to $10 per 1,000 units. OBRA 93 also amended section 1861(s)(2)(P)
to remove the word ``home'' from ``home dialysis patients'', the effect of which is to allow coverage of EPO when used
at home by dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home. The effective date of section 13566 of OBRA is January 1, 1994.




B. Regulations Revision 



The change in payment rate requires no revision to regulations because we announce the rate in a notice published in
the 

Federal Register

 rather than in regulations. To implement the provision allowing dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home to use
EPO in the home, we are revising   405.2137, 405.2163, 410.10(k), and 410.52 to show the effective dates
of the various sections for use of EPO at home by patients who do not dialyze at home.

XII. Part B Premium 



A. Legislative Provision 



Section 1839(e) of the Act establishes the amount of the Medicare Part B premium at 50 percent of the monthly actuarial
rate for enrollees age 65 and over for months in calendar years 1984 through 1990; section 4301 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 added specific premiums for 1991 through 1995 based on Congressional Budget Office estimates,
at the time, of premium amounts that would equal 50 percent of that actuarial rate. Section 13571 of OBRA 93 amended
section 1839(e) of the Act to again have the premium determined annually so that it equals 50 percent of the monthly
actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over for calendar years 1996, 1997 and 1998. 



B. Regulations Revisions 



To reflect OBRA 90 and 93 we are revising 42 CFR 408.20, Monthly premiums, by adding calendar years 1991 through 1995,
and calendar years after 1998, to the heading and content of paragraph (b), which currently contains the methodology
for the period July 1976 through December 1983 and the periods after 1990. We are specifying that the rates cited in
section 1839(e)(1)(B) of the Act apply to 1991 through 1995. To reflect OBRA 93, we are adding calendar years 1996 through
1998 to the heading and content of paragraph (c), which currently discusses the methodology for determining premiums
for calendar years 1984 through 1990. 



XIII. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking for a regulation in the 

Federal Register

 and provide a period for public comment. However, we may waive that procedure if we find good cause that prior notice
and comment are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. 

As noted earlier, this rule updates our rules to properly reflect explicit statutory requirements that are clear
on their face and that we are not interpreting in any way beyond their commonly understood meanings. Without these
changes, certain regulation requirements are in conflict with the statute, possibly misleading those who rely on
our regulations. In addition, some of the statutory changes included in these regulations have been enacted with
retroactive effective dates or effective dates close to the date of enactment of OBRA 93. Under these circumstances,
prompt publication of the correct up-to-date rules best serves those governed by these regulations. Because this
rule does not create any legal requirements and because publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking here would perpetuate
conflicts between clear statutory directives and our regulations, we find that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking
before issuing this final rule would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. However, we are providing
a 60-day comment period for public comments on the final rule as indicated at the beginning of this rule. 



XIV. Response to Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on FR documents published for comment,
we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider all comments we receive by the date
and time specified in the 

DATES

 section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with a subsequent document, we will respond to the comments in the preamble
to that document. 



XV. Regulatory Impact Statement 



We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all Medicare-participating facilities are considered
to be small entities. Individuals and States are not included in the definition of small entity. 

Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule will
have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 

This final rule with comment period updates our regulations to incorporate numerous self-implementing statutory
provisions that are not interrelated. None of the regulations interprets or extends requirements beyond those included
in the self-implementing legislation. 

The amendments to which this rule pertains are already in effect or will go into effect independent of the publication
of this rule. Consequently, there are no actions to be taken that would flow from further analyses of the impact of these
provisions on entities. Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since
we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant economic impact on the operations
of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 

In accordance with the provisions of E.O. 12866, this final rule with comment period was not reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget. 



XVI. Collection of Information Requirements



This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.).

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule with comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule with comment period implements the 
provisions of section 4007(b) of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1987, as amended by section 411(b)(6) 
of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which 
require the Secretary to place into effect a standardized 
electronic cost reporting system for all hospitals under the 
Medicare program. Under this final rule with comment 
period, all hospitals are required to submit their cost 
reports, for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1989, in a uniform electronic format. The 
Secretary may grant a delay or a waiver of this requirement 
where implementation could result in financial hardship for 
a hospital.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


Under Medicare, hospitals are paid for inpatient 
hospital services that they furnish to beneficiaries under 
Part A (Hospital Insurance). Currently, most hospitals are 
paid for their inpatient hospital services under the 
prospective payment systems for operating and capital costs 
in accordance with sections 1886(d) and (g) of the Social 
Security Act (the Act) and 42 CFR part 412. Under these 
systems, Medicare payment is made at a predetermined, 
specific rate for each hospital discharge based on the 
information contained on actual bills submitted. 

Section 1886(f)(1)(A) of the Act provides that the 
Secretary will maintain a system for reporting costs of 
hospitals paid under the prospective payment systems. 
Section 412.52 requires all hospitals participating in the 
prospective payment systems to meet the recordkeeping and 
cost reporting requirements of   413.20 and 413.24, which 
include submitting a cost report for each 12-month period. 

The hospitals and hospital units that are excluded from 
the prospective payment systems are generally paid an amount 
based on the reasonable cost of services furnished to 
beneficiaries. The inpatient operating costs of these 
hospitals and hospital units are subject to the ceiling on 
the rate of hospital cost increases in accordance with 
section 1886(b) of the Act and  413.40. 

Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no 
payments will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished 
the information, requested by the Secretary, needed to 
determine the amount of payments due the hospital under the 
Medicare program. In general, hospitals submit this 
information through cost reports that cover a 12-month 
period. 

All hospitals participating in the Medicare program, 
whether they are paid on a reasonable cost basis or under 
the prospective payment systems, are required under 
 413.20(a) to ``maintain sufficient financial records and 
statistical data for proper determination of costs payable 
under the program.'' In addition, hospitals must use 
standardized definitions and follow accepted accounting, 
statistical, and reporting practices. Under the provisions 
of   413.20(b) and 413.24(f), hospitals are required to 
submit cost reports annually, with the reporting period 
based on the hospital's accounting year.

II. Legislation Concerning Electronic Reporting 


On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
Act of 1987, Public Law 100-203, was enacted. Section 4007 
of Public Law 100-203, which was subsequently amended by 
section 411(b)(6) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act 
of 1988, Public Law 100-360, added section 1886(f)(1)(B) of 
the Act, which sets forth several provisions concerning the 
reporting of hospital information under the Medicare 
program. Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act applies to 
hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1989. 
Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the 
Secretary will place into effect a standardized electronic 
cost reporting format for hospitals under Medicare. This 
standardized electronic cost reporting format does not 
require any additional data from hospitals. Section 
1886(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that the Secretary may 
delay or waive the implementation of the electronic format 
in instances where such implementation would result in 
financial hardship for a hospital. As an example of a 
financial hardship situation, this section of the Act 
specifically mentions hospitals with a small percentage of 
inpatients entitled to Medicare benefits. 


III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 


On August 19, 1991, we published a proposed rule (56 FR 
41110) to implement sections 1886(f)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of 
the Act. We proposed that cost reports be submitted in a 
standardized electronic format. The hospital's cost report 
software must be able to produce a standardized output file 
in American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
(ASCII) format. All intermediaries have the ability to read 
this standardized file and produce an accurate cost report. 
The proposed rule did not require the reporting of any 
additional information. 
If a hospital refuses to submit the cost reports 
electronically, Medicare payments to that hospital may be 
suspended under the provisions of sections 1815(a) and 
1833(e) of the Act. As explained above, sections 1815(a) 
and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no Medicare payments 
will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished the 
information, requested by the Secretary, needed to determine 
the amount of payments due the hospital under the Medicare 
program. Section 405.371(d) provides for suspension of 
Medicare payments to a hospital by the intermediary if the 
hospital has failed to submit information requested by the 
intermediary that is needed to determine the amount due the 
hospital under Medicare. The general procedures that are 
followed when Medicare payment to a hospital is suspended 
for failure to submit information that is needed by the 
intermediary to determine Medicare payment (that is, when a 
hospital fails to furnish a cost report, furnishes an 
incomplete cost report, fails to furnish other needed 
information, or fails to submit a cost report 
electronically) are located in section 2231 of the 
Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13). These procedures 
include timeframes for ``demand letters'' to hospitals, which 
in addition to reminding hospitals to file timely and 
complete cost reports, explain possible adjustments of 
Medicare payments to a hospital and the right to request a 
30-day extension of the due date. If a hospital believes 
that implementation of the electronic submission requirement 
would cause a financial hardship, the hospital should submit 
a written request for a waiver or a delay of these 
requirements, with supporting documentation, to the 
hospital's intermediary. 


IV. Discussion of Public Comments 


In response to the proposed rule, we received six 
timely items of correspondence. We have summarized the 
comments and are presenting them below with our responses.

A. Requirements for Electronic Submission 




Comment:

 A few commenters requested clarification 
concerning the format for electronic reporting. 


Response:

 HCFA provided approved vendors of cost 
reporting software with a uniform standardized format for 
the creation of the required ASCII file. This format shows 
how each unique record must be displayed in the electronic 
file in terms of worksheet, line, and column position. The 
specifications required to complete a computerized Medicare 
Cost Report have been in effect since the inception of the 
Automated Desk Review (ADR) program in 1983. There are 
presently three vendors approved by HCFA for the ADR system. 
Eight other commercial vendors are approved by HCFA for 
electronic compilation of the Medicare cost report. A 
hospital may use any of the 11 vendors for purposes of 
filing an electronically prepared cost report. Each of the 
11 vendors must undergo periodic testing in which it 
develops and submits to HCFA a completed cost report to 
demonstrate its system's ability to conform to HCFA's 
display standards. No hospital may file its cost report 
electronically unless the commercial software system it uses 
has completed the testing process and been approved by HCFA. 
In addition, when the provider files the cost report 
with the intermediary, the cost report must pass edits 
specified in the Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part II, 
before the intermediary can accept it. If the cost report 
fails to pass these edits the intermediary will immediately 
reject the cost report and return it to the provider for 
correction. The cost report will be considered late if the 
provider fails to correct it before the due date. The 
provider will be subject to withholding of interim payments 
until the intermediary receives the corrected cost report. 


Comment:

 Several commenters questioned the need to 
file a hard copy cost report in addition to submitting the 
electronic cost report. Additionally, commenters were 
concerned with the lack of a written statement certifying 
the accuracy of the electronic cost report. One commenter 
suggested that HCFA require providers to submit a written 
certification with the electronic cost report. 


Response:

 We agree with the commenters concerns 
regarding the need to file a hard copy cost report and the 
lack of a statement certifying the accuracy of the 
electronic file. Therefore, effective for cost reporting 
periods ending on or after October 1, 1994, we are 
eliminating the requirement that providers file a hard copy 
of the cost report in addition to the electronic file. In 
new  413.24(f)(4)(iii), we specify that instead of 
a hard copy cost report, providers must submit a hard copy 
of the certification statement, settlement summary, and a 
statement of certain worksheet totals found within the cost 
report file. We note that the certification statement 
provides that in signing the statement, the provider's 
administrator or chief financial officer is certifying the 
accuracy of the data contained in the electronic cost report 
or, if the provider has filed a manually prepared report, in 
the hard copy cost report. 
We believe that these changes will reduce the burden on 
providers and ensure the accuracy of the data contained in 
the electronic file. However, we also need to ensure that 
the electronic cost report is not altered once it leaves the 
provider. Thus, in conjunction with the changes made based 
on public comment, we are implementing a series of changes 
designed to preserve the integrity of the electronic cost 
report once the provider files it with the intermediary. 
First, we are specifying in new  413.24(f)(4)(ii) 
that the provider's software must be capable of disclosing 
that changes have been made to the cost report file after 
the provider has submitted it to the intermediary. 
Specifically, electronic cost reporting software will be 
modified so that the cost report will calculate a ``hash 
total'', that is, a number representing the sum of the 
worksheet totals (mentioned above) contained in the 
provider's as filed cost report. If any data in the 
electronic file is changed after the hash total is 
calculated, the electronic file will disclose that a change 
has been made. We will instruct all automated data 
reporting vendors to develop the capability to calculate 
hash totals and disclose changes for all their provider 
clients. Second, we are specifying in regulations that an 
intermediary may not alter a cost report once it has been 
filed by a hospital and must reject any cost report that 
does not pass all specified edits and return it to the 
provider for correction. Third, HCFA will make periodic 
checks to ensure that the totals in the electronic file 
agree with those totals certified by the provider's 
administrator or chief financial officer. 
Because providers may not have anticipated such 
substantial changes as a result of this rule, we are 
soliciting comments concerning the requirement in new 
 413.24(f)(4)(ii) that cost report software be able to 
disclose changes to the electronic file made after the 
provider has submitted it to the intermediary. 


Comment:

 One commenter requested that the intermediary 
be required to report back to the provider in electronic 
cost reporting format the audit adjustments made to the 
provider's cost report. This would allow providers to 
readily add the audit adjustments to the electronic cost 
report for future reference. 


Response:

 We recognize the merit of this suggestion 
and will consider implementing this process in the future. 
The intermediaries would need additional computer 
programming to be able to provide hospitals with an 
electronic file of audit adjustments. We will discuss the 
commenter's suggestion with the 11 approved vendors of cost 
report software to determine the extent of additional 
programming needed and the financial implications.

B. Waiver Process 





Comment:

 Several commenters requested guidance concerning the process for seeking a delay in or waiver from the electronic
submission requirement. The commenters also wanted to know under what circumstances HCFA would grant a delay or waiver.
Commenters suggested that HCFA define the term ``financial hardship'' as used in the proposed rule. 



Response:

 The Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, section 130, provides the guidelines for requesting a waiver. Basically,
the provider must make a written request to the intermediary at least 120 days before the close of the provider's cost
reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request and forwards it, with a recommendation for approval or denial,
to HCFA's central office within 30 days of receipt of the request. The central office informs the intermediary whether
the waiver is approved or denied within 60 days of receipt of the request in the central office. 

Because of the varying financial circumstances of hospitals and other health care providers that participate in
the Medicare program, we believe that it would be inappropriate to establish a definition of ``financial hardship''
or a set of specific criteria that a provider would need to meet to qualify for a waiver of the electronic cost reporting
requirement. We believe that the best method for determining whether a provider qualifies for a waiver is to consider
requests on a case by case basis. 

To date, we have received only eight requests for waiver. We believe that the small number of requests indicates that
the majority of providers will not experience financial hardship as a result of electronic cost reporting. In addition,
in an effort to minimize the number of providers that need a waiver, we developed a software package that will enable
the hospital to file an electronic data set to its fiscal intermediary in order to generate an electronic cost report.
We are providing the software package to hospitals free of charge. Therefore, we believe that with the availability
of the free software, it will be difficult for a provider to demonstrate financial hardship. 



Comment:

 A commenter recommended that HCFA provide an automatic waiver of electronic cost report filing in each instance in
which a waiver of standard or full cost reporting has been granted, including those cases where full cost reporting
has been waived because of a low percentage of Medicare inpatients. 



Response:

 HCFA will grant an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting if a provider is exempt from full or standard cost
reporting. To qualify for an automatic waiver of electronic cost reporting, the provider must apply and qualify for
an exemption from full or standard cost reporting in accordance with the rules that provide for the exemption. For
example, a provider that does not furnish any covered services to Medicare beneficiaries is exempt from filing a full
cost report and instead must submit an abbreviated report under  413.24(g). Additionally, a provider with
low program utilization may obtain a waiver from filing a full cost report in accordance with  413.24(h). When
the intermediary notifies a provider that it qualifies for an exemption from filing a full cost report, the provider
also will be notified of the exemption from electronic filing. Providers must apply for a waiver of full cost reporting
for each new cost reporting period. Providers that are not exempt from full cost reporting must file for a waiver according
to the procedure set forth in section 130 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual, part II, as discussed above.

C. Sanctions 




Comment:

 Commenters requested HCFA's position 
regarding the penalties assessed against a provider for 
failing to file its cost report electronically. 


Response:

 Sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act 
provide that no payments will be made to a hospital unless 
it has furnished the information requested by the Secretary 
needed to determine the amount of payments due the hospital 
under the Medicare program. Section 405.371(d) provides for 
suspension of Medicare payments to a hospital by the 
intermediary if the hospital fails to submit a cost report, 
submits an incomplete cost report, or fails to furnish other 
needed information. Section 2409.1(A)(1) of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (PRM 15-I) addresses the procedures an 
intermediary will follow when a provider fails to submit a 
cost report or when the cost report is overdue. Unless the 
provider has received a waiver from electronic cost 
reporting, the intermediary will consider a timely filed 
cost report that is not filed electronically as an overdue 
cost report for purposes of section 2409.1(A)(1). We will 
update this section of the manual to reflect our position 
regarding sanctions for failure to file cost reports 
electronically. 


D. Cost of Implementation 




Comment:

 A commenter disagreed with our statement in 
the impact analysis of the proposed rule that hospitals 
would not be significantly affected by electronic cost 
reporting. The commenter stated that some hospitals had to 
make expensive changes in personnel or software to comply 
with the regulations and that the cost of maintaining the 
required software was an additional burden on providers. 
The commenter suggested that HCFA pay providers for the cost 
of implementing the electronic cost reporting requirement 
including the cost of equipment, software, additional 
personnel, external consultants, and any related overhead 
costs. 


Response:

 Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act does not 
authorize HCFA to subsidize any of the costs hospitals incur 
in implementing electronic cost reporting. However, it does 
authorize the waiver or delay of the implementation of the 
electronic format in cases of financial hardship. As 
discussed above, if computer support required for electronic 
cost reporting will cause financial hardship, the hospital 
may request a waiver from electronic filing. 


V. Provisions of the Final Regulations 


In this final rule with comment, we are revising the 
provisions set forth in the proposed rule. Based on public 
comment, we are eliminating the requirement that providers 
file a hard copy cost report in addition to the electronic 
file. Also based on public comment, we are adding a new 
paragraph (iii) to  413.24(f)(4) to provide that in 
addition to the electronic file, a hospital must submit hard 
copies of a settlement summary, a statement of certain 
worksheet totals found in the electronic file, and a signed 
statement certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or 
the manually prepared cost report. 
In addition to the changes made based on public 
comment, we are adding a new paragraph (ii) to 
 413.24(f)(4) to provide the following: 
 All cost reporting software must be able to disclose 
that changes have been made to the electronic file after the 
provider has submitted its cost report to the intermediary. 
 The intermediary may not alter the cost report once it 
has been filed by the provider. 
 The intermediary rejects any cost report that does not 
pass all specified edits and returns it to the provider for 
correction. 
As a result of the above changes to the regulations 
text, proposed  413.24(f)(4)(ii) has been 
redesignated as  413.24(f)(4)(iv). 


VI. Collection of Information Requirements 


Section 413.24 of this final rule with comment 
contains information collection and recordkeeping 
requirements that are subject to review by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction 
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These information 
collection and recordkeeping requirements are not effective 
until they have been approved by OMB. We have submitted a 
copy of this final rule with comment to OMB for review of 
the information collection requirements. 
Approximately 90 percent of hospitals participating in 
Medicare have filed electronic cost reports before the 
effective date of this regulation, that is with cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1989. 
These providers will now have to file a diskette containing 
the required cost report data in a standard format. This 
diskette will contain input data only. We believe that 
minimal time would be needed for hospitals to become 
familiar with the revised software furnished by their cost 
reporting vendor. The remaining 10 percent of the hospitals 
previously filed manually prepared cost reports. While 
these hospitals will initially experience an additional 
reporting burden, we believe that once they are familiar 
with electronic reporting, there will no longer be an 
additional burden and there may even be a decrease in burden 
since the time needed to compute the cost report will no 
longer be required.

VII. Response to Comments 



Because of the number of items of correspondence we normally receive on 

Federal Register

 documents published for comment, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. We will consider
comments we receive by the date and time specified in the ``DATES'' section of this preamble, and, if we proceed with
a final rule, we will respond to comments in the preamble to that document. Specifically, we are soliciting comments
concerning the requirement in new  413.24(f)(4)(ii) that cost reporting software be able to detect changes
made to the electronic file after the provider has submitted it to the intermediary. We will not consider comments
concerning provisions that remain unchanged from the August 19, 1991 proposed rule or provisions that were changed
based on public comment. 


VIII. Impact Statement 


Unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). For purposes of the RFA, all hospitals and small businesses that
distribute cost-report software to hospitals are considered to be small entities. Intermediaries are not included
in the definition of a small entity. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that has fewer than 50 beds and is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area. 
Under the provisions of   413.20(b) and 413.24(f), hospitals are required to submit cost reports annually,
with reporting periods based on the hospital's accounting year. This is generally a consecutive 12-month period.
Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act now requires the use of a standardized electronic cost reporting format for hospitals.
There are approximately 11 national software suppliers that distribute cost report software packages to hospitals.
In addition, HCFA offers a cost reporting software package that is available at no expense to any hospital that requests
it. 
As discussed in the proposed rule, computer software suppliers and hospitals that purchased their software will
not be significantly affected by these provisions. Suppliers will not need to develop new software and hospitals
will not need to purchase new software but only revise the software or have the cost report portion of the software revised
based on standard format requirements set by HCFA. Although the cost report portion of software packages will be exactly
the same, competition among suppliers will not be adversely affected since each offers other features that make its
product unique. 
Hospitals that will be most affected by this final rule with comment period are those that may be unable to afford the
equipment to submit electronically. These hospitals might include hospitals that have very few Medicare beneficiaries
and small rural hospitals. Hospitals that have access to computer equipment can utilize and benefit from HCFA's free
software if they are unable to afford the software that is available from suppliers. However, as stated above, we have
received only eight requests for waiver of electronic cost reporting. We believe that the small number of requests
indicates that the vast majority of hospitals will not experience financial hardship due to the requirements of this
final rule with comment period. 
In conclusion, this final rule with comment period will not have a significant effect on hospital costs since hospitals
will not be required to collect any additional data beyond that which the regulations currently specify; cost-report
software is available at no cost from HCFA to any hospital that requests it; and most hospitals have some type of computer
equipment through which they are currently submitting electronically prepared cost reports. Hospitals will only
be affected to the extent that all would be required to submit cost reports in a standardized electronic format to their
respective intermediary. A hospital that does not comply with the provisions of this rule, as specified in the preamble,
will be subject to sections 1815(a) and 1833(e) of the Act, which provide that no payments will be made to a hospital
unless it has furnished the information requested by the Secretary that is needed to determine the amount of payments
due the hospital under Medicare. 
This final rule with comment period will not have a significant effect on a substantial number of Medicare participating
hospitals or software suppliers. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. We are not preparing
a rural impact statement since the Secretary certifies that this final rule with comment period will not have a significant
economic impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. In accordance with the provisions
of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

(f) 

Cost reports.

 * * * 
(4) 

Electronic submission of cost reports.

 (i) 
Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1989, a hospital is required to submit its cost 
reports in a standardized electronic format. The hospital's 
electronic program must be capable of producing the HCFA 
standardized output file in a form that can be read by 
intermediary's automated system. This electronic file, 
which must contain the input data required to complete the 
cost report and the data required to pass specified edits, 
is forwarded to the fiscal intermediary for processing 
through its system. 

(ii) The fiscal intermediary may not alter the cost 
report once it has been filed by the hospital. If a cost 
report does not pass all specified edits, the fiscal 
intermediary rejects the cost report and returns it to the 
hospital for correction. The hospital's electronic program 
must be able to disclose that changes have been made to the 
electronic cost report after the provider has submitted it 
to the intermediary. 

(iii) Effective for cost reporting periods ending on 
or after October 1, 1994, a hospital must submit a hard copy 
of a settlement summary, a statement of certain worksheet 
totals found within the electronic file, and a statement 
signed by its administrator or chief financial officer 
certifying the accuracy of the electronic file or the 
manually prepared cost report. The following statement must 
immediately precede the dated signature of the hospital's 
administrator or chief financial officer:




I hereby certify that I have read the above 
certification statement and that I have examined the 
accompanying electronically filed or manually submitted 
cost report and the Balance Sheet Statement of Revenue 
and Expenses prepared by 

XXXX

 (Provider Name(s) and Number(s)) for the cost reporting period beginning 

XXXX

 and ending 

XXXX

 and that to the best of my knowledge and belief, this report and statement are true, correct, complete and prepared
from the books and records of the provider in accordance with applicable instructions, except as noted. I further
certify that I am familiar with the laws and regulations regarding the provision of health care services, and that
the services identified in this cost report were provided in compliance with such laws and regulations.

 


(iv) A hospital may request a delay or waiver of the 
electronic submission requirement in paragraph (f)(4)(i) of 
this section if this requirement would cause a financial 
hardship. The hospital must submit a written request for 
delay or waiver with necessary supporting documentation to 
its intermediary at least 120 days prior to the end of its 
cost reporting period. The intermediary reviews the request 
and forwards it with a recommendation for approval or 
denial, to HCFA central office within 30 days of receipt of 
the request. HCFA central office either approves or denies 
the request and notifies the intermediary within 60 days of 
receipt of the request.

National Flood Insurance Program; Assistance to Private Sector Property Insurers



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Insurance Administration, FEMA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule amends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations for the ``Write Your Own'' (WYO)
Program relating to the marketing of flood insurance policies. This interim rule modifies the Arrangement to encourage
increases in the policyholder base and to increase the financial stability of the NFIP.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Write-Your-Own (WYO) Program (established in 1983) was authorized pursuant to Subpart C, part 62 of the National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations and section 1345 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended
(Pub. L. 90-448, 42 U.S.C. 4001, 

et seq.

).



Under the WYO Program, the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (the form and substance of which is approved by the Federal
Insurance Administrator (the Administrator)) may be issued in their own names by insurers signatory to Financial
Assistance/Subsidy Arrangements. Insurers then are responsible for all aspects of service, including policy issuance
to new policyholders and to policyholders insured by them under other lines of property insurance; endorsement and
renewal of policies; and the adjustment of claims brought under the policies. The insurers retain a specified amount
of the premium for their expenses, including the commissions of agents. Under the Arrangement, the Government provides
such additional funds as may be required, over and above the net premium income, for the payment of claims.

Once the Arrangement is signed by the authorized official of the private insurer and the Government, it is effective
at the beginning of the Government's Fiscal Year on October 1 and runs through the following September 30. Also, in
accordance with Article V_Commencement and Termination of the Arrangement, the Federal Insurance Administration
(FIA) is required, by June 1 of each year, to publish in the 

Federal Register

 the terms for the re-subscription of the Arrangement for the next Arrangement Year.

This interim rule amends the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations dealing with the marketing of flood
insurance policies, at Article II_Undertakings of the Company, paragraph G. of the Arrangement, by requiring the
WYO Company to follow marketing guidelines established by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA). FIA is currently
developing marketing guidelines which will then be established in consultation with representatives of the WYO
Companies.

As a result of the heavy flood losses which occurred in recent years (i.e., Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in August and
September 1992, the Northeaster storm in December 1992, the blizzard of March 1993, and the Midwest flooding in the
summer of 1993), FEMA recently had to exercise its borrowing authority for the first time in eight years. While the
Program has been growing modestly, greater increases in the policyholder base are needed to provide additional premium
dollars to build up the reserves to meet future catastrophic flooding events. Further, large numbers of the victims
of recent flood disasters were not protected by flood insurance. Therefore, FEMA has determined that sufficient
cause exists for making this rule effective immediately so the revised Arrangement can be the basis of the Offer required
by June 1 and that delaying the effective date until after a comment period would be impracticable and contrary to the
public interest. However, comments are requested and will be considered before further regulations are issued.

Publication of the Arrangement in this interim rule also constitutes, for the WYO Program Arrangement year of October
1, 1994_September 30, 1995, the Administrator's ``Offer to Assist Insurers in Underwriting Flood Insurance Using
the Standard Flood Insurance Policy.''



Method of Acceptance of Offer



1. Acceptance of this offer shall be by mailed notice of acceptance or signed Arrangement to the Administrator `prior
to midnight EDT September 30, 1994. The notice may be preceded by facsimile transmission (202) 646-3445 which
must be received by midnight EDT September 30, 1994.

2. The facsimile transmission or mailed notice of acceptance to the Administrator must be authorized by an official
of the insurance company who has the authority to enter into such arrangements.

3. A duly signed original copy of the Notice of Acceptance (see No. 6 below) must be on file with the Administrator by
November 16, 1994.

4. If 1., 2., or 3. above are not satisfied, the acceptance will be considered by the Administrator as conditional and
the commitment of NFIP resources to fulfill the ``Undertaking of the Government'' under Article IV of the Arrangement
will take a lower priority than those needed to fulfill the requirement of the other participating insurance companies.

5. Send all acceptances of this offer to: Federal Emergency Management Agency, Attn: Federal Insurance Administrator,
WYO Program, Washington, DC 20472.

6. In accepting this offer, use the Notice of Acceptance Form set forth below:

Article I_Findings, Purpose, and Authority 


Whereas, the Congress in its ``Finding and Declaration of Purpose'' in the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as
amended, (``the Act'') recognized the benefit of having the National Flood Insurance Program (the Program) ``carried
out to the maximum extent practicable by the private insurance industry''; and 
Whereas, the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) recognizes this Arrangement as coming under the provisions
of Section 1345 of the Act; and 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-0-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Whereas, the goal of the FIA is to develop a program with the insurance industry where, over time, some risk-bearing
role for the industry will evolve as intended by the Congress (Section 1304 of the Act); and 
Whereas, the Program, as presently constituted and implemented, is subsidized, and the insurer (hereinafter the
``Company'') under this Arrangement shall charge rates established by the FIA; and 
Whereas, this Arrangement will subsidize all flood policy losses by the Company; and 
Whereas, this Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement has been developed to involve individual Companies in
the Program, the initial step of which is to explore ways in which any interested insurer may be able to write flood insurance
under its own name; and 
Whereas, one of the primary objectives of the Program is to provide coverage to the maximum number of structures at
risk and because the insurance industry has marketing access through its existing facilities not directly available
to the FIA, it has been concluded that coverage will be extended to those who would not otherwise be insured under the
Program; and 
Whereas, flood insurance policies issued subject to this Arrangement shall be only that insurance written by the
Company in its own name pursuant to the Act; and 
Whereas, over time, the Program is designed to increase industry participation, and, accordingly, reduce or eliminate
Government as the principal vehicle for delivering flood insurance to the public; and 
Whereas, the direct beneficiaries of this Arrangement will be those Company policyholders and applicants for flood
insurance who otherwise would not be covered against the peril of flood. 
Now, therefore, the parties hereto mutually undertake the following: 


Article II_Undertakings of the Company

of all of the Company's marketing, operating and administrative expenses, except for allocated and unallocated
loss adjustment expenses described in C. of this Article, which amount shall equal the average of industry expense

not include ``incurred but not reported'').

2. Allocated loss adjustment expense shall be reimbursed to the Company pursuant to Exhibit A, entitled ``Fee Schedule.''

3. Special allocated loss expenses shall be reimbursed to the Company for only those expenses the Company has obtained
prior approval of the Administrator to incur.

2. Loss payments will include payments as a result of awards or judgments for damages arising under the scope of this
Arrangement, policies of flood insurance issued pursuant to this Arrangement, and the claims processing standards
and guides set forth at Article II, Section A, 2.0 of this Arrangement. Prompt notice of any claim for damages as to claims
processing or other matters arising outside the scope of this section (D)(2) shall be sent to the Assistant Administrator
of the FIA's Office of Insurance Policy Analysis and Technical Services (OIPATS), along with a copy of any material
pertinent to the claim for damages arising outside of the scope of the matters set forth in this section (D)(2).

Following receipt of notice of such claim, the General Counsel (OGC), FEMA, shall review the cause and make a recommendation
to FIA as to whether the claim is grounded in actions by the Company which are significantly outside the provisions
of this section (D)(2). After reviewing the General Counsel's recommendation, the Administrator will make her decision
and the Company will be notified, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the General Counsel's recommendation, if
the decision is that any award or judgment for damages arising out of such actions will not be recognized under Article
III of this Arrangement as a reimbursable loss cost, expense or expense reimbursement. In the event that the Company
wishes to petition for reconsideration of the notification that it will not be reimbursed for the award or judgment
made under the above circumstances, it may do so by mailing, within thirty days of the notice declining to recognize
any such award or judgment as reimbursable under Article III, a written petition to the Chairman of the WYO Standards
Committee established under the Financial Control Plan. The WYO Standards Committee will, then, consider the petition
at its next regularly scheduled meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose by the Chairman and issue a written
recommendation to the Administrator, within thirty days of the meeting. The Administrator's final determination
will be made, in writing, to the Company within thirty days of the recommendation made by the WYO Standards Committee.

E. Premium refunds to applicants and policyholders required pursuant to rules contained in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) ``Flood Insurance Manual'' shall be made by the Company from funds retained in the bank account established
under Article II, Section E and, if such funds are depleted, from funds derived by drawing against the Letter of Credit
established pursuant to Article IV.



Article IV_Undertakings of the Government



A. Letter(s) of Credit shall be established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) against which the Company
may withdraw funds daily, if needed, pursuant to prescribed procedures as implemented by FEMA. The amounts of the
authorizations will be increased as necessary to meet the obligations of the Company under Article III, Sections
(C), (D), and (E). Request for funds shall be made only when net premium income has been depleted. The timing and amount
of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization
for allowable Letter of Credit expenses.

Request for payment on Letters of Credit shall not ordinarily be drawn more frequently than daily nor in amounts less
than $5,000, and in no case more than $5,000,000 unless so stated on the Letter of Credit. This Letter of Credit may be
drawn by the Company for any of the following reasons:

1. Payment of claim as described in Article III, Section D; and

2. Refunds to applicants and policyholders for insurance premium overpayment, or if the application for insurance
is rejected or when cancellation or endorsement of a policy results in a premium refund as described in Article III,
Section E; and

3. Allocated and unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses as described in Article III, Section C.

B. The FIA shall provide technical assistance to the Company as follows:

1. The FIA's policy and history concerning underwriting and claims handling.

2. A mechanism to assist in clarification of coverage and claims questions.

3. Other assistance as needed.



Article V_Commencement and Termination



A. Upon signature of authorized officials for both the Company and the FIA, this Arrangement shall be effective for
the period October 1 through September 30. The FIA shall provide financial assistance only for policy applications
and endorsements accepted by the Company during this period pursuant to the Program's effective date, underwriting
and eligibility rules.

B. By June 1, of each year, the FIA shall publish in the 

Federal Register

 and make available to the Company the terms for the re-subscription of this Financial Assistance/Subsidy Arrangement.
In the event the Company chooses not to re-subscribe, it shall notify the FIA to that effect by the following July 1.

C. In the event the Company elects not to participate in the Program in any subsequent fiscal year, or the FIA chooses
not to renew the Company's participation, the FIA, at its option, may require (1) the continued performance of this
entire Arrangement for one (1) year following the effective expiration date only for those policies issued during
the original term of this Arrangement, or any renewal thereof, or (2) the transfer to the FIA of:

by the Company under the Program including provisions for coordination assistance; and 
c. All claims and policy files, including those pertaining to receipts and disbursements which have occurred during

report showing, on a policy basis, any amounts due from or payable to insureds, agents, brokers, and others as of the
transition date. 
D. Financial assistance under this Arrangement may be cancelled by the FIA in its entirety upon 30 days written notice
to the Company by certified mail stating one of the following reasons for such cancellation: (1) Fraud or misrepresentation
by the Company subsequent to the inception of the contract, or (2) nonpayment to the FIA of any amount due the FIA. Under
these very specific conditions, the FIA may require the transfer of data as shown in Section C., above. If transfer
is required, the unearned expenses retained by the Company shall be remitted to the FIA. 
E. In the event the Act is amended, or repealed, or expires, or if the FIA is otherwise without authority to continue
the Program, financial assistance under this Arrangement may be cancelled for any new or renewal business, but the
Arrangement shall continue for policies in force which shall be allowed to run their term under the Arrangement. 
F. In the event that the Company is unable to, or otherwise fails to, carry out its obligations under this Arrangement
by reason of any order or directive duly issued by the Department of Insurance of any Jurisdiction to which the Company
is subject, the Company agrees to transfer, and the Government will accept, any and all WYO policies issued by the Company
and in force as of the date of such inability or failure to perform. In such event the Government will assume all obligations
and liabilities owed to policyholders under such policies arising before and after the date of transfer and the Company
will immediately transfer to the Government all funds in its possession with respect to all such policies transferred
and the unearned portion of the Company expenses for operating, administrative and loss adjustment on all such policies.



Article VI_Information and Annual Statements 


The Company shall furnish to the FIA such summaries and analyses of information in its records as may be necessary to
carry out the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, in such form as the FIA, in cooperation
with the Company, shall prescribe. The Company shall be a property/casualty insurer domiciled in a State or territory
of the United States. Upon request, the Company shall file with the FIA a true and correct copy of the Company's Fire
and Casualty Annual Statement, and Insurance Expense Exhibit or amendments thereof, as filed with the State Insurance
Authority of the Company's domiciliary State. 


Article VII_Cash Management and Accounting 


A. FEMA shall make available to the Company during the entire term of this Arrangement and any continuation period
required by FIA pursuant to Article V, Section C., the Letter of Credit provided for in Article IV drawn on a repository
bank within the Federal Reserve System upon which the Company may draw for reimbursement of its expenses as set forth
in Article IV which exceed net written premiums collected by the Company from the effective date of this Arrangement
or continuation period to the date of the draw. 
B. The Company shall remit all funds not required to meet current expenditures to the United States Treasury, in accordance
with the provisions of the WYO Accounting Procedures Manual. 
C. In the event the Company elects not to participate in the Program in any subsequent fiscal year, the Company and FIA
shall make a provisional settlement of all amounts due or owing within three months of the termination of this Arrangement.
This settlement shall include net premiums collected, funds drawn on the Letter of Credit, and reserves for outstanding
claims. The Company and FIA agree to make a final settlement of accounts for all obligations arising from this Arrangement
within 18 months of its expiration or termination, except for contingent liabilities which shall be listed by the
Company. At the time of final settlement, the balance, if any, due the FIA or the Company shall be remitted by the other
immediately and the operating year under this Arrangement shall be closed. 


Article VIII_Arbitration 


A. If any misunderstanding or dispute arises between the Company and the FIA with reference to any factual issue under
any provisions of this Arrangement or with respect to the FIA's non-renewal of the Company's participation, other
than as to legal liability under or interpretation of the standard flood insurance policy, such misunderstanding
or dispute may be submitted to arbitration for a determination which shall be binding upon approval by the FIA. The
Company and the FIA may agree on and appoint an arbitrator who shall investigate the subject of the misunderstanding
or dispute and make a determination. If the Company and the FIA cannot agree on the appointment of an arbitrator, than
two arbitrators shall be appointed, one to be chosen by the Company and one by the FIA.

The two arbitrators so chosen, if they are unable to reach an agreement, shall select a third arbitrator who shall act
as umpire, and such umpire's determination shall become final only upon approval by the FIA. 
The Company and the FIA shall bear in equal shares all expenses of the arbitration. Findings, proposed awards, and
determinations resulting from arbitration proceedings carried out under this section, upon objection by FIA or
the Company, shall be inadmissible as evidence in any subsequent proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction.

This Article shall indefinitely succeed the term of this Arrangement. 


Article IX_Errors and Omissions 


The parties shall not be liable to each other for damages caused by ordinary negligence arising out of any transaction
or other performance under this Arrangement, nor for any inadvertent delay, error, or omission made in connection
with any transaction under this Arrangement, provided that such delay, error, or omission is rectified by the responsible
party as soon as possible after discovery. 
However, in the event that the Company has made a claim payment to an insured without including a mortgagee (or trustee)
of which the Company had actual notice prior to making payment, and subsequently determines that the mortgagee (or
trustee) is also entitled to any part of said claim payment, any additional payment shall not be paid by the Company
from any portion of the premium and any funds derived from any Federal Letter of Credit deposited in the bank account
described in Article II, section E. In addition, the Company agrees to hold the Federal Government harmless against
any claim asserted against the Federal Government by any such mortgagee (or trustee), as described in the preceding
sentence, by reason of any claim payment made to any insured under the circumstances described above. 


Article X_Officials Not to Benefit 


No Member or Delegate to Congress, or Resident Commissioner, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Arrangement,
or to any benefit that may arise therefrom; but this provision shall not be construed to extend to this Arrangement
if made with a corporation for its general benefit. 


Article XI_Offset 


At the settlement of accounts the Company and the FIA shall have, and may exercise, the right to offset any balance or
balances, whether on account of premiums, commissions, losses, loss adjustment expenses, salvage, or otherwise
due one party to the other, its successors or assigns, hereunder or under any other Arrangements heretofore or hereafter
entered into between the Company and the FIA. This right of offset shall not be affected or diminished because of insolvency
of the Company. 
All debts or credits of the same class, whether liquidated or unliquidated, in favor of or against either party to this
Arrangement on the date of entry, or any order of conservation, receivership, or liquidation, shall be deemed to be
mutual debts and credits and shall be offset with the balance only to be allowed or paid. No offset shall be allowed where
a conservator, receiver, or liquidator has been appointed and where an obligation was purchased by or transferred
to a party hereunder to be used as an offset. Although a claim on the part of either party against the other may be unliquidated
or undetermined in amount on the date of the entry of the order, such claim will be regarded as being in existence as of
the date of such order and any credits or claims of the same class then in existence and held by the other party may be offset
against it. 


Article XII_Equal Opportunity 


The Company shall not discriminate against any applicant for insurance because of race, color, religion, sex, age,
handicap, marital status, or national origin. 


Article XIII_Restriction on Other Flood Insurance 


As a condition of entering into this Arrangement, the Company agrees that in any area in which the Administrator authorizes
the purchase of flood insurance pursuant to the Program, all flood insurance offered and sold by the Company to persons
eligible to buy pursuant to the Program for coverages available under the Program shall be written pursuant to this
Arrangement.

However, this restriction applies solely to policies providing only flood insurance. It does not apply to policies
provided by the Company of which flood is one of the several perils covered, or where the flood insurance coverage amount
is over and above the limits of liability available to the insured under the Program. 


Article XIV_Access to Books and Records 


The FIA and the Comptroller General of The United States, or their duly authorized representatives, for the purpose
of investigation, audit, and examination shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the Company
that are pertinent to this Arrangement. The Company shall keep records which fully disclose all matters pertinent
to this Arrangement, including premiums and claims paid or payable under policies issued pursuant to this Arrangement.
Records of accounts and records relating to financial assistance shall be retained and available for three (3) years
after final settlement of accounts, and to financial assistance, three (3) years after final adjustment of such claims.
The FIA shall have access to policyholder and claim records at all times for purposes of the review, defense, examination,
adjustment, or investigation of any claim under a flood insurance policy subject to this Arrangement. 


Article XV_Compliance with Act and Regulations 


This Arrangement and all policies of insurance issued pursuant thereto shall be subject to the provisions of the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, and Regulations issued
pursuant thereto and all Regulations affecting the work that are issued pursuant thereto, during the term hereof.



Article XVI_Relationship Between the Parties (Federal Government and Company) and the Insured 


Inasmuch as the Federal Government is a guarantor hereunder, the primary relationship between the Company and the
Federal Government is one of a fiduciary nature, i.e., to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately
expended. 
The Company is not the agent of the Federal Government. The Company is solely responsible for its obligations to its
insured under any flood policy issued pursuant hereto. 
In witness whereof, the parties hereto have accepted this Arrangement on this

Summer Flounder Fishery



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notification of commercial quota adjustment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces adjustments to the commercial quota for the 1994 summer flounder fishery. This action complies with
regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP), which require quota
overages landed in any state to be deducted from that state's quota the following year. The public is advised that a
quota adjustment has been made and is informed of the revised state quotas.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Regulations implementing Amendment 2 to the FMP are found at 50 CFR part 625, the final rule being published on December
4, 1992 (57 FR 57358). The regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among
the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated
to each state is described in  625.20. The commercial summer flounder quota for the 1994 calendar year, adopted
to ensure achievement of the appropriate fishing mortality rate of 0.53 for 1994, is set to equal 16,005,560 lb (7.3
million kg) (59 FR 10586, March 7, 1994).



Section 625.20(d)(2) provides that all landings for sale in a state shall be applied against that state's annual commercial
quota. Any landings in excess of the state's quota will be deducted from that state's annual quota for the following
year. Based on dealer reports and other available information, the following states were determined to have exceeded
their 1993 quotas: Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. The remaining
states of New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York did not exceed their 1993 quotas and, therefore,
no adjustments are necessary for these states. Table 1 shows the 1993 quotas adjusted for authorized transfers made
between states during the year, 1993 landings, 1993 overage amounts, 1994 quotas, and the adjusted 1994 quotas taking
into account 1993 overage amounts, by state.

Northeast Multispecies Fishery 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures 
contained in Framework Adjustment 4 to the Northeast Multispecies 
Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The measures contained in this 
rule are a series of time and area closures for sink gillnet gear 
to reduce bycatch of harbor porpoise. These measures replace 
blocks of time during each month during which all sink gillnets 
would be required to be removed from the water. The intent of 
this rule is to reduce significantly the bycatch of harbor 
porpoise in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) 
submitted Amendment 5 to NMFS on September 27, 1993. One of its 
principal objectives was to reduce the bycatch of harbor porpoise 
in the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery by the end of year 4 of 
implementation of the Amendment to a level not to exceed 2 percent 
of the population, based on the best estimates of abundance and 
bycatch. 
The Council was requested by NMFS in October 1992 to take 
action to reduce the harbor porpoise bycatch within the context of 
Amendment 5. The Council agreed to develop fishery management 
measures that would address the issue on the basis that the sink 
gillnet fishery was subject to regulation under the FMP, there 
were no existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce porpoise takes, 
and the current level of bycatch in the fishery was not 
sustainable. 
Additionally, on January 7, 1993, NMFS published a proposed 
rule (58 FR 3108) to list the Gulf of Maine population of harbor 
porpoise as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due 
primarily to the level of incidental takes in the sink gillnet 
fishery and the lack of an adequate regulatory mechanism to 
accomplish bycatch reductions. As NMFS noted in the rule, the 
Marine Mammal Exemption Program contained in the 1988 amendments 
to the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) did not set bycatch 
limits. 
The Council subsequently adopted the goal of achieving 
reductions in harbor porpoise bycatch, so that the actual amount 
of harbor porpoise caught as bycatch in the sink gillnet fishery 
would not exceed 2 percent of the estimates of the harbor porpoise 
population, in part to avoid the pending ESA listing. This 
objective was based on a recruitment rate for harbor porpoise that 
is about 4 percent per year, and a conservative fisheries bycatch 
level that should not exceed 50 percent of the recruitment rate 
for marine mammals. The 1991/1992 pooled harbor porpoise 
population abundance estimate is 47,200. Using the lower bound of 
the 95-percent confidence interval for that estimate, 39,500, the 
1990, 1991, and 1992 ratios of bycatch to average population 
abundance were approximately 6 percent, 4.3 percent and 
2.2 percent, respectively. A 2-percent goal allocated solely to 
the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet fishery did not take into account 
the unknown level of harbor porpoise takes in the Mid-Atlantic 
region and in adjacent Canadian waters. 
Because the 1992 abundance and bycatch information was not 
available until June 1993, however, development of effective 
measures based on the best scientific information lagged behind 
the formulation of the overall Amendment 5 package. The harbor 
porpoise bycatch mitigation measure implemented by the final rule 
for the Amendment required the removal of all sink gillnets from 
the water during 4-day blocks of time each month in year 1 after 
implementation of Amendment 5. Years 2 and 3 of Amendment 5 
called for 8-day blocks each month. Year 4 required 12-day blocks 
and year 5 required 16-day blocks. The Council supported, and 
NMFS approved, the use of blocks of time as an interim measure on 
the assumption that appropriate time and area management measures 
would be developed as soon as possible. 
The rationale for the interim measure was based largely on 
the lack of information concerning the sink gillnet fishery. By 
``masking'' periods of time monthly, during which all sink gillnets 
must be removed from the water, the time during which harbor 
porpoise would be exposed to that gear would be reduced. In a 
simulation analyzing the effect of closing the Gulf of Maine sink 
gillnet fishery for 4 consecutive random days per month, 
approximately 8.5 percent of the fish would not be landed and 9.3 
percent of the harbor porpoise bycatch would be avoided. The 
effect of choosing random days, however, produced very different 
values of harbor porpoise bycatch for the different trials.

Because of the imprecise nature of the impacts of the blocks 
of time, and upon receipt of the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science 
Center's (NEFSC) comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of 
the bycatch in the fall of 1993, the Council voted to support the 
development of a time and area closure management system. The 
intent was to replace the existing gillnet alternative (nets 
removed from the water for specified blocks of time) as the harbor 
porpoise bycatch mitigation measure. The Council decided, and 
NMFS agreed, that the gillnet fleet would not be subject to 
groundfish effort reductions until the effect of the harbor 
porpoise bycatch reduction measures could be evaluated for their 
impacts on groundfish fishing effort (approximately 1 year after 
implementation of Amendment 5). 
NMFS is amending the regulations under the framework 
abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and 
codified at 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure requires 
the Council, when making specifically allowed adjustments to the 
FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span of at least 
two Council meetings. The Council must provide the public with 
advance notice of both the proposals and the analysis, and 
opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council 
meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the 
Council may recommend to the Regional Director of NMFS that the 
measures be published as a final rule if certain conditions are 
met. The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) 
may publish the measures as a final rule or as a proposed rule if 
additional public comment is needed. 
The Council complied with the procedural requirements and 
submitted the rule to NMFS, and NMFS concurs with the provisions 
of the Council's submission. This final rule implements time and 
area closures based on an analysis by the NEFSC of harbor porpoise 
bycatch using NMFS weighout and observer program data on the 
distribution of sink gillnet activity and the seasonal and spatial 
distribution of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine. Extensive 
discussions among the Council, the fishing industry and scientists 
led to the measures outlined below. 
For purposes of the management measures contained in this 
final rule for Framework Adjustment 

#

4, the Gulf of Maine is 
divided into three areas: The Northeast (from Penobscot Bay to 
Eastport, ME); Mid-coast (from Cape Ann to Penobscot Bay); and 
Massachusetts Bay (from Cape Cod to Cape Ann). The Council 
recommended 30-day closures for each of these areas. The timing 
of the closures corresponds to periods when harbor porpoise 
bycatch is most likely to occur. The duration accounts for the 
variability of harbor porpoise movements. The Council recognizes 
that the Mid-coast and Northeast areas account for more of the 
bycatch than Massachusetts Bay. At this time, however, harbor 
porpoise bycatch mitigation measures are being applied uniformly 
across all regions in the Gulf of Maine. 
The NEFSC estimated that reductions of 20 to 40 percent might 
be realized in the first year of implementation of Framework 
Adjustment 

#

4 if boundaries discussed in its initial analysis of a 
time and area management system for the Gulf of Maine were used in 
conjunction with the proposed 30-day closures. The Council's 
boundary modifications could alter that estimate to some unknown 
degree because of the potential displacement of gillnet fishing 
effort to areas where harbor porpoise are still subject to some 
level of bycatch. It is reasonable, however, to anticipate the 
minimum estimate of approximately 20 percent, given that the 
timing of the closures occurs in seasons of highest bycatch of 
harbor porpoise in their respective areas. It is also reasonable 
to conclude that the continued annual target reductions may be 
accomplished by modifications to the same measures. 
The Council adopted the approach of integrating effort 
reductions for key species of groundfish stocks with harbor 
porpoise bycatch mitigation measures after the first year of 
program implementation. If the measures, or any future approach 
that is adopted, accomplish the harbor porpoise objective without 
reducing gillnet fishing effort sufficiently to reach the 50 
percent effort reduction target, the Council will impose 
additional fishing restrictions.

There is a band outside the Mid-coast closure area that 
encompasses Jeffreys Ledge and is described relative to the Mid-
coast area as east on 42
 30 N. from the shore to 70
 00 W., north 
along 70
 00 W. to 43
 00 N., on 43
 00 N. to 69
 00 W., then north on 
69
 00 W. to the shore. According to the sea sampling data base, 
harbor porpoise bycatch in this band has been relatively high 
during the last 3 years. Concerns focus on whether a displacement 
of more fishing effort into this region might account for a kill 
rate as high as or potentially higher than in previous years. 
Under provisions of this final rule, the band will remain open, 
but the Council recommended mandatory observer coverage for 
vessels fishing in the area if funds are available. 


D. Open Areas: 


Areas shown on Figure 4 to part 651, but not 
enclosed by the boundary lines described above, would not be 
subject to closure at this time. 
The Council program calls for a 20-percent reduction in the 
Gulf of Maine harbor porpoise bycatch in year 1 of implementation 
of Amendment 5. To ensure continued efforts to reduce the 
bycatch, Amendment 5 states that a Harbor Porpoise Review Team 
(HPRT), appointed by the Council, will evaluate the effectiveness 
of the Council's mitigation measures annually by September 15 of 
each year and, if necessary, recommend changes to ensure that the 
bycatch reduction goals are met. 
Future management measures will be designed to achieve a 
60-percent reduction in the bycatch of harbor porpoise from 
current levels over a 3-year period. Based on a bycatch of 1,300 
animals (a figure that constitutes a rough average of the bycatch 
estimates over the last 2 years), the bycatch in years 1, 2, and 3 
would be reduced to 1,040, 780, and 520 animals, respectively. 
Such a reduction schedule might surpass the goal of reducing 
the harbor porpoise bycatch to a level not to exceed 2 percent of 
the estimates of population abundance and bycatch (39,500 and 
approximately 1,300, respectively). The use of the lower bound of 
the 95-percent confidence interval for the abundance estimate, 
39,500, adds a level of conservatism that in part addresses the 
problem of the confidence intervals surrounding the bycatch 
estimates. As previously discussed, the entire 2 percent bycatch 
cannot be allocated solely to the Gulf of Maine sink gillnet 
fleet. 
A specific target for year 4 will be established by the HPRT 
after consideration of previous targets not met in any given year 
or because of possible increased bycatch reductions required by 
the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act. For 
example, if the 20 percent target is missed in any of the first 
three years, the fourth year allows the flexibility to add that 
portion of the target reductions not achieved in any of the first 
three years to be deferred until the next year or until year four 
of the program. The year-4 target, however, cannot exceed 20 
percent of the total reduction required over the entire 4-year 
period. 


Comments and Responses 


The Council held the first of two meetings required under the 
Amendment 5 framework adjustment process on February 17, 1994. 
Two public hearings were subsequently held on March 9, 1994, in 
Portsmouth, NH, and on March 10, 1994, in Ellsworth, ME. The 
Council approved the closures for the Northeast and Mid-coast 
areas at the second Council meeting held on March 17, 1994. On 
April 6, 1994, the Council adopted boundaries and a 30-day closure 
period for the Massachusetts Bay area. 
In addition to the meetings held within the formal framework 
period, the public was notified of all Marine Mammal Committee 
meetings held between September 1993 and March 1994, for the 
purpose of developing the time and area closure plan. For scoping 
purposes, the issue also was included in the Amendment 5 public 
hearing document and was reviewed at a series of coastwide 
meetings held in the spring of 1993. 

Comments on the Council's proposal were received from Maine 
Congressional Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and the following 
organizations: Cape Ann Gillnetter's Association, Beverly, MA; 
Coonamessett Farm, Falmouth, MA; International Wildlife Coalition, 
East Falmouth, MA; Maine Gillnetters Association, Stonington, ME; 
Massachusetts Netters Association, Marshfield, MA; and the New 
Hampshire Commercial Fishermen's Association, Rye, NH. 


Comment: 

Numbers of fishermen had serious concerns about the 
quality of the data used to determine time and area closures. 
Response: Measures contained in Framework Adjustment 

#

4 are 
based on the best scientific information available. NMFS has 
conducted two population surveys of harbor porpoise abundance in 
the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy region. Additionally, bycatch 
estimates have been calculated from observed gillnet trips, based 
on sea sampling data collected since 1989. Since June 1991, 
observers have made trips on roughly 9 percent of the Gulf of 
Maine gillnet trips. All available information on the biology, 
seasonal distribution, abundance and bycatch was reviewed at two 
international workshops convened by the NEFSC in Woods Hole, MA in 
May 1992 and February 1994.

Comment: 

Several commenters expressed concern over the harbor 
porpoise abundance estimates for the Gulf of Maine/Bay of Fundy 
population and the disparity between the point estimates for 1991 
and 1992. They urged the Council to ask NMFS to conduct ongoing 
surveys in order to better refine the data. 


Response: 

Again, the estimates are based on the best 
scientific information available. NMFS abundance estimates for 
1991 and 1992 are 37,500 (% coefficient of variation (CV)=28.8, 
95% confidence interval (CI)=26,700 to 86,400) and 67,500 (%CV=23.1, 95% CI=32,900 to 104,600), respectively.
The reason for the 
nearly twofold, but statistically insignificant, increase between 
1991 and 1992 is unknown. Although the increase is statistically 
insignificant, it may reflect a real change in abundance due to a 
distribution change or methodological sampling error. Methods to 
investigate this difference were recommended at the February 23-25 
NEFSC workshop to evaluate the status of harbor porpoise in the 
western North Atlantic. An abundance survey has been recommended 
for 1995. 



Comment: 

A suggestion was made to divide the Northeast 
closure area in half, longitudinally, or simply to make the entire 
area smaller. 



Response: 

The Northeast area proposed for closure from August 
15 through September 13 already represents a compromise forged 
between fishermen and the Council. But concerns still exist that 
animals will move into adjacent areas where vessels may 
concentrate and increase the likelihood of takes, rather than 
reduce that possibility. Also, NMFS survey data indicate that 
harbor porpoise usually frequent the same general areas of the 
Gulf of Maine, but not always at the same time every year. Because 
of this variability, shorter closures in smaller areas could 
result in little or no reduction in bycatch, if animals are not 
present during the closure period. This would result in lost 
fishing time with no benefit. 



Comment: 

Commenters expressed concern about Northeast time 
and area closures that would eliminate fishing in the Schoodic 
Ridge area, a region vital to the ``downeast'' fishermen. 




Response: 

The Council's final decision took into account the 
fact that the time and area plan would be phased in over 4 years. 
During the first year of implementation, the Schoodic Ridge 
fishing grounds will be left open. Further changes to the area 
will be based on the harbor porpoise bycatch estimates derived 
from sea sampling program and other relevant data submitted to the 
Council. 



Comment: 

Commenters from Maine questioned why Jeffreys Ledge, 
an area located off the coasts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire 
that accounts for a relatively high level of bycatch, was being 
left open in the first year of the plan. 



Response: 

The Council's Mid-coast closure area incorporates 
an area known as Jeffreys Basin, but excludes Jeffreys Ledge. In 
past years, the basin area has represented a higher level of 
bycatch than Jeffreys Ledge. Concerns focus on whether the 
displacement of more fishing effort onto Jeffreys Ledge might 
account for a kill rate as high as or potentially higher than, in 
previous years. As with the Northeast area, however, the Council 
considered the boundaries adequate for year one of implementation 
of Framework Adjustment 

#

4. Bycatch of harbor porpoise will be 
monitored and the need to adjust the boundaries can be 
accomplished under the framework system. 



Comment: 

One individual asked for an exemption for small-boat 
operators who fish inshore only, and who are responsible for 
little or no harbor porpoise bycatch. Otherwise, they would 
effectively be excluded from the fishery as of the November 1-30 
Mid-coast closure because they are too small to fish in offshore 
conditions. Another commenter suggested that these vessels fish 
under the 500-pound (226.8 kg) possession limit for regulated 
species of groundfish. 



Response: 

Harbor porpoise throughout the Gulf of Maine are 
distributed both inshore and offshore and become entangled in 
gillnets, regardless of vessel size. Additionally, all sink 
gillnet vessels fishing under a Federal multispecies permit, 
regardless of where they are fishing, are subject to the porpoise 
bycatch reduction measures. 



Comment: 

Gillnet gear should be given credit, one commenter 
said, for being size-selective and for resulting in discards of 
juvenile finfish. 



Response: 

Once the time and area program has been in place 
(approximately 1 year from the date of implementation), the 
Council will evaluate the impact of the gillnet fishery on the 
mortality of groundfish stocks and develop management measures 
that are appropriate for the gillnet sector. 



Comment: 

Some commenters felt the harbor porpoise bycatch 
reduction program was a mechanism being used by other interests to 
close the sink gillnet fishery. 



Response: 

The Council's measures are designed to minimize 
impacts on the sink gillnet fishery, while at the same time 
achieve the stated harbor porpoise bycatch reduction objectives. 
The Council has held 16 public meetings since its initial 
commitment to incorporate bycatch measures in Amendment 5 and has 
involved the fishing community, conservation groups and interested 
parties in the development of the FMP. 



Comment: 

Several commenters felt it was inappropriate to use 
the harbor porpoise time and area closure plan to protect 
endangered whales. 



Response: 

As part of the Council's obligations under section 
7 of the ESA, a consultation with NMFS is required if a fishery 
affects, either directly or indirectly, endangered or threatened 
species or any designated critical habitat. Because this 
framework adjustment represents a change in management measures 
for a gear type that has interactions with endangered species, the 
Council re-initiated the section 7 consultation developed for 
Amendment 5, identified potential interactions and has addressed 
them in the context of this framework adjustment. 



Comment: 

Many fishermen supported the use of ``pingers,'' sound 
emitting devices that increase an animal's awareness of nets, as a 
bycatch mitigation measure. A suggestion was made to use pingers 
in year 1 of implementation of Amendment 5 in conjunction with 
four-day blocks of time, but with no subsequent expansion of the 
days during which nets would be removed from the water in future 
years.

Response: 

The 4-day blocks of time during which all gillnets 
would be removed from the water each month throughout the range of 
species covered by the Northeast Multispecies FMP was almost 
universally rejected by commenters who attended public meetings 
and by those who submitted written comments. The Council and NMFS 
are aware that initiatives are underway which involve acoustical 
alarm research and possible modifications to gillnet gear to 
reduce porpoise bycatch. If any of these approaches produce 
scientifically supportable results that can be incorporated into a 
management strategy, the Council would recommend them through a 
framework adjustment with a minimum of regulatory delay. 



Comment: 

Several commenters questioned why the Council 
rejected the use of an industry proposal based on a reduction in 
the number of gillnets in use. 



Response: 

At this time, it is not possible to determine the 
relationship between the number of nets and fishing or harbor 
porpoise mortality. It is known only that there is a relationship 
that is not linear. Even a simple estimation of the number of 
nets in use is impossible, at present, because of the variability 
of length of nets, numbers of nets in a string, soak time and the 
variable numbers of both full- and part-time vessels participating 
in the fishery. Moreover, enforcement of a reduction in the 
number of nets in the ocean, as opposed to a time and area 
prohibition, would be very difficult, if not impossible, to 
accomplish at this time. 



Classification 


This regulation is not subject to the requirements to prepare 
a proposed rule under the conditions met by this framework action 
that have provided adequate prior public comment when the action 
was proposed and discussed over the course of several Council 
meetings. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not 
prepared for this action because it is exempt from such an 
analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


This final rule has been determined to be not significant for 
purposes of E.O. 12866. 

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA) finds 
there is good cause to waive prior notice under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) of 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Public meetings held by 
the Council to discuss the management measures implemented by this 
rule provided adequate opportunity for public comment to be 
considered. Thus, additional opportunity for public comment is 
unnecessary. 

The AA also finds that under section 553(d)(1) of the APA, 
because immediate implementation of this rule relieves a 
restriction that would require 4 days out of the water by all 
vessels using sink gillnet gear in May and June, there is no need 
to delay for 30 days the effectiveness of this regulation.

Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues a final rule to implement Amendment 7 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries of the Western
Pacific Region (FMP). This rule establishes a limited entry program for the Hawaii longline fishery for pelagic species.
The rule also includes broad framework procedures for more efficient administration of the fishery. The action is
intended to improve the management of the longline fishery based in Hawaii to achieve optimum yield and prevent overfishing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FMP was prepared by the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved and implemented by
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) at a time when there were few problems in the domestic fisheries for management
unit species (billfish and associated species) and the Hawaii longline fishery consisted of less than 40 relatively
small vessels fishing primarily near the Hawaiian Islands. Conditions are now very different. The longline fishery
based in Hawaii now consists of 167 vessels up to 101 ft (30.8 m) in length and targets swordfish, tuna, and other management
unit species. Vessels often travel up to 2,000 miles (3,219 km) from port. 


Due to the rapid growth of this fishery, concern was raised about the potential and actual impact of the expanded fishery
on the status of some fish stocks, the impact of increased longline catches on other fisheries, and interactions between
longline fishing and protected species such as Hawaiian monk seals and sea turtles. This led to establishment in April
1991 of a 3-year moratorium on new entry to the Hawaii longline fishery. Amendment 7 to the FMP establishes a new limited
entry program for the Hawaii-based longline fishery. 
The limited entry program requires permits that will be freely transferable. Permit owners may upgrade their vessels
or transfer their permits for registration with other vessels provided the newly designated vessel is no longer than
101 ft (30.8 m) in length as measured in accordance with the rule. Initial permit issuance decisions are made by the
Fisheries Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. The program includes provision for appeals of permit decisions
to the Regional Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director). The rule includes broad framework procedures
for subsequent adjustment of the conservation and management measures for the pelagics fisheries to provide for
more efficient administration of the fisheries. Three species of fish are added to the management unit. The rule also
makes several technical changes to the regulations. 
A proposed rule to implement Amendment 7 to the FMP was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 9050). The proposed rule (1) described in detail the concerns being addressed by the Council
and actions taken by the Council and Secretary to address those concerns, (2) summarized the measures proposed in
Amendment 7 and the objectives of the amendment, and (3) indicated the reasons for other regulatory changes proposed.
Those discussions will not be repeated here. After consideration of public comment on the Amendment and the proposed
rule, Amendment 7 was approved; this final rule implements that amendment. 
This rule is consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), which requires that final rules be published
not less than 30 days before they become effective. In the period between publication of the final rule and the effective
date, NMFS will advise moratorium permit holders of the need to submit applications and supporting information in
a timely manner so that new limited entry permits can be issued by the effective date of this rule. 


Comments and Responses 


Comments were received from, or on behalf of, 46 fishery participants, workers in support industries, and other interested
parties. Most (40) favored approval of the amendment and the proposed rule. Four commenters recommended disapproval
or partial disapproval of the amendment. Two commenters submitted technical comments concerning the language of
the permit eligibility criteria. In the proposed rule, NMFS specifically invited comment on the adequacy of the proposed
rule and complementary actions taken by the Council and NMFS to ensure that the take of sea turtles in the longline fishery
would not be excessive. One set of comments was received in response. Summaries of comments and NMFS responses are
provided below. 


Comments 

(1): Comments favoring the amendment were received from 40 people. Most of these were on petitions from workers in
the longline fishery or support industries. The signers supported Amendment 7 because they felt it would provide
stability, promote conservation, and provide vessel owners with flexibility needed to make sound business decisions.
In addition, separate letters were received from seven permit holders supporting the amendment. They felt it would
prevent overfishing and adverse impacts on other fisheries, would provide needed flexibility to vessel owners to
make business decisions, and would maintain substantial economic benefits to the fishery participants and support
industries. All commenters supporting the Amendment noted that existing area closures would be retained so that
there should be no adverse effects on other fisheries. 


Response 

(1): None needed, Amendment 7 has been approved and is being implemented by this final rule. 


Comment 

(2): One individual (an owner of several of the larger longline vessels with permits) recommended that the amendment
be disapproved because the fishery is already showing signs of economic difficulty, with longer trips, smaller fish,
and less profit. In the commenter's view, allowing further vessel upgrades would exacerbate the economic difficulties.
The amendment also was criticized for allowing upgrading of smaller vessels while prohibiting upgrading of larger
vessels.

<TEXT>
 



Response 

(2): The available data do not indicate any economic or biological problems in the fishery. The amendment indicates
that the average sizes of most species of fish landed have held relatively steady since 1987, and the average size of
swordfish has increased since 1987. Aside from this commenter, no other participants in the fishery have indicated
that their catches or profits have declined, except for fishermen who were effectively precluded from fishing traditional
grounds by the area closures imposed around the main Hawaiian Islands. There is no indication that catch rates have
decreased due to excessive fishing pressure. The Council and NMFS acknowledge that the expanded longline fishery
has been operating for only a few years and that many interested parties have expressed concern about possible long-term
impacts on the stocks or other fisheries and protected species. Therefore, the Council has proposed an approach to
allow a limited increase in the fishery with greater flexibility for fishermen to make business decisions. Controlled
expansion of the fishery will provide a basis for determining whether the expanded fishery is affecting fish stocks
or fishery participants and whether corrective action is needed. If information later indicates problems, the amendment
includes framework procedures to address those problems. Allowing upgrading of smaller vessels is intended to provide
a fair competitive opportunity within the longline fishery for owners of small vessels that were effectively precluded
from fishing when the longline area closures went into effect. It is not expected that all participants will acquire
larger vessels to the maximum size permitted, though some shift to larger vessels is expected. Finally, disapproval
of the amendment would result in no limit on participation. No change was made to the rule in response to these comments.



Comment 

(3): One environmental conservation organization commented in opposition to the amendment. This organization
indicated the moratorium on new entry should be continued until data are available from the longline observer program
and other sources to assess impacts on sea turtles and the status of fish stocks harvested by the longline fishery.
This organization felt that the allowable incidental take of sea turtles is excessive and was concerned that the amendment
would result in additional effort and thus a risk of higher turtle takes and jeopardy to turtle stocks. The commenter
also was critical of the low level of coverage achieved in the voluntary program. 


Response 

(3): The moratorium terminated at 12 midnight on April 22, 1994. If the amendment had been disapproved, there would
no longer have been any limitation on the number or size of longline vessels in the fishery. The moratorium may not be
continued unless the Secretary rejects the amendment and issues regulations under the Secretary's amendment authority.
In the Secretary's view, the framework procedures of Amendment 7 allow relatively quick action to adjust management
measures if needed to protect sea turtles or fish stocks. 
A mandatory observer program was established by an interim final rule published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67699).
By April 10, 1994, 14 completed trips had been observed. This represents a significant increase in observer coverage
over the voluntary program. Consultations under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) have been reinitiated
and will consider data from the voluntary and mandatory observer programs, and information on the status and trends
of turtle populations, to determine whether new conservation recommendations or reasonable and prudent measures
should be applied in this fishery. 
With respect to the impacts of the fishery on fish stocks, the available data indicate that no stocks have been affected
by the longline fishery to date. No changes have been made in the regulations in response to these comments. 


Comment 

(4): Two other commenters recommended partial disapproval of the amendment. Both favored limited entry for the longline
fishery, but also favored limiting harvesting capacity of the fleet by only allowing vessel upgrades for safety,
and not providing permits to those who did not fish in the moratorium. One emphasized the incomplete and dated nature
of much of the data used and criticized the management system and fishery for the waste of sharks, noting that only a
very small portion of the shark catch is retained; this commenter also suggested a quota system could be developed.
The other commenter proposed that, if vessel upgrades are allowed, gear upgrades should be limited. A harvesting
capacity quota approach should be developed in a three-tier (small, medium, and large) vessel system. This commenter
feared that longliners could decimate stocks and then move to new areas, leaving local fishermen to pay the price.
Both commenters also suggested that some Council members who worked on the amendment had financial conflicts of interest.



Response 

(4): Many elements of the amendment already comport with the commenters' recommendations; for example, the maximum
number of permits may be no more than the number in the moratorium, and permits will not be issued to persons who did not
fish (excluding small vessels and persons who obtained longline permits due to linkage with lobster permits) during
the moratorium. However, the Council chose to allow more flexibility for vessel upgrades to equalize the opportunity
for all vessel owners to compete in the fishery. The best scientific information available has been used. The Council
and NMFS acknowledged the limitations of the data. The amendment includes framework procedures so management adjustments
can be made rapidly if the data indicate a need for changes. The Council chose not to recommend a quota system, given
the inadequacy of data to determine allowable catch and allocations to different fishermen. The Council considered
gear limitations but recognized the serious difficulty in enforcing such limitations due to limited at-sea enforcement
resources. 
Issues of discards and bycatch have been raised to the Council, and the Council will review the data collected under
the mandatory observer program to determine how to address these issues in the future. The Council considered establishment
of a harvesting capacity management system and concluded that a fair and effective system would require much additional
data collection and analysis. The Council agreed to continue work on alternate means to control effort and capacity
for implementation through the framework procedures in the amendment. 
Regarding conflict of interest, the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) permits Council
members with financial interests in harvesting, marketing, or processing activities to vote on matters that affect
those interests, if disclosed publicly in accordance with regulations governing Regional Fishery Management Councils
at 50 CFR part 601. No changes were made in the regulations in response to these comments.

Comment

 (5): One commenter indicated that the regulations need to be modified to accommodate people who may still have longline
permit applications pending under the moratorium. 



Response

 (5): There were no permit applications pending when the moratorium ended, therefore no change was necessary in the
regulations to respond to this comment. 



Comment

 (6): The Council indicated that the language of the permit eligibility criteria concerning the linkage between longline
permits and northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permits needed revision to be consistent
with the intent of the Council. That is, the criteria in the proposed rule would not have afforded eligibility for a
Hawaii longline limited entry permit to someone who, at the end of the moratorium, was the last holder of record of a
moratorium longline limited entry permit and held a northwest Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) lobster limited entry permit,
both of which were obtained from another party. It was the Council's intent that a person who obtained both permits
from another party would thus be eligible for a Hawaii longline limited entry permit based on ``the lobster fishery
criterion'' referred to in Amendment 7. 



Response

 (6): A new paragraph  685.9(b)(2)(iv) has been added to be consistent with the Council's intent. It is estimated
that five longline permit holders will be affected by this change by qualifying for new permits under these criteria.




Changes from the Proposed Rule 



An item inadvertently not discussed in the proposed rule is that initial permit decisions are made by the Chief, Fisheries
Management Division, Southwest Region, NMFS. This final rule includes a provision for appeals of permit decisions
to the Regional Director. Experience in the moratorium program indicates a need for an appeal process to review decisions
that applicants believe are incorrect or based on faulty interpretation of facts. 

The definition of ``length overall'' of a vessel has been revised to mean only the horizontal distance between the
foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern. The length overall does not include fittings or attachments
that extend beyond these two points, including bowsprits, rudders, or outboard motor brackets. References in the
proposed definition to other vessel length measurements appearing in U.S. Coast Guard or state vessel registration
documents have been removed because they could have resulted in the use of different vessel length measurement systems.
As revised, the definition provides a consistent and uniform method of determining vessel length for all vessels
participating in the fishery; it is the same method of length measurement used in many other federally regulated fisheries.
Under this definition, the longest vessel active in the fishery in the moratorium is 101 feet (30.8 m) rather than 
93 feet (28 meters), as described in the preamble to the proposed rule. 

The eligibility criteria for issuance of a Hawaii limited entry permit in  685.9(b)(2) were modified. As noted
in response to comment Number 6 the linkage between longline permits and NWHI lobster limited entry permits was modified
to be consistent with Council intent. Also, several moratorium permits were invalidated due to the sinking or destruction
of vessels. The holders of these permits had been active during the moratorium period and therefore would qualify
for permits under the new program. By focussing on the last holder of record of limited entry permits issued under the
moratorium, the final rule provides that these individuals will qualify for new permits, consistent with the intent
of Amendment 7. 

A prohibition ( 685.9(a)(4)) was added to require that necessary permits be on board vessels and available
for inspection by an authorized agent unless the vessel was at sea when the permit was issued, in which case the permit
must be on board the vessel on the next trip. The requirement for the permit to be on board the vessel was in effect during
the moratorium, but was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule.

A deadline for applications for initial Hawaii longline limited entry permits has been set in  685.9(c) to ensure
that the number of permits will be limited after a given period of time. Applications must be submitted within 120 days
after the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

. The Council will be considering changes in allowable participation and effort in the future and needs to know the
size of the permitted fleet in order to evaluate the benefits and costs of changes in regulations. 

A change was made to the observer program ( 685.11) to refer to Hawaii longline limited entry permit requirements
( 685.9(a)(2)), so that the notification requirements of  685.11 will apply to owners of vessels with
such permits. 

Technical changes were made in the designation of sections and paragraphs due to the expiration of provisions implemented
under the moratorium on new entry to the longline fishery. 



Classification 



This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

The Council prepared a combined final FMP amendment/Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (RFA) covering the impacts of the fishery as managed under this amendment and alternative approaches. The
final FMP amendment/final EIS satisfies National Environmental Policy Act requirements for documentation and
analysis of the impacts of the fishery on the environment. 

A consultation under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) was conducted and NMFS issued a Biological Opinion
(Opinion) and Incidental Take Statement (Statement) in June 1993 concerning the take of sea turtles in the longline
fishery. Consultations have been reinitiated and a new Biological Opinion is being prepared. A new consultation
to address Amendment 7 is not necessary. 

This rule is expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Hawaii longline
vessel owners (approximately 167) will have more flexibility to buy and sell vessels and permits and to upgrade their
fishing vessels to compete more effectively in the domestic longline fishery, as well as with foreign fleets. It is
estimated that total revenue from longline landings will increase to $60 million per year from about $45 million in
1992. The final amendment/FEIS includes an RFA that is adopted as final without change. 

This rule includes a change in an information collection previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB No. 0648-0204). The change is included in a request submitted by the Southwest Region, NMFS, for approval
of modification and extension of the current collection that covers all Southwest Region fishery permit programs.
The change requires prospective participants in the Hawaii longline fishery to submit permit application forms
and supporting information, including a current Certificate of Documentation from the U.S. Coast Guard, to obtain
or transfer a permit under the new limited entry program. Landings records from the existing Hawaii longline logbook
reporting requirement will be used to determine whether an individual has met the landings requirement to qualify
for a permit. The estimated burden on the applicants is 30 minutes per application. This is less than the average of
1 hour or more that had been required for applications for permits in the moratorium period, because the moratorium
applications required documentation of intent to enter the longline fishery at a time when investment decisions
were made. The documentation requirements under the new permit program will be simpler. 

This rule also restates requirements for the submission of logbooks and post-landing notifications. These requirements
have already been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648-0214. The response times for these requirements
were estimated to be 5 minutes per day for the logbook and 5 minutes per notification. Send comments regarding these
burden estimates or any other aspect of these collection-of-information requirements, including suggestions
for reducing burden, to the Director of the Southwest Region, NMFS, and to OMB (see

8. Section 685.15 is revised to read as follows: 



 685.15

Permit appeals. 



(a) Except as provided in subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, any applicant for a permit or any permit owner may appeal to the
Regional Director the granting, denial, conditioning, suspension, or transfer of a permit or requested permit.
To be considered by the Regional Director, the appeal must be in writing, must state the action(s) appealed, and the
reasons therefor, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action(s) by the FMD. The appellant may request an informal
hearing on the appeal. 

(b) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Director may request additional information.
Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Director will decide the appeal in accordance with the criteria
set out in this part and in the Fishery Management Plan for Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region, as appropriate,
based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information
available; the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, as provided
in paragraph (c) of this section; and such other considerations as deemed appropriate. The Regional Director will
notify the appellant of the decision and the reasons therefor, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of
sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing. 

(c) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Director determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Director
may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose. Such a hearing normally shall
be held no later than 30 days following receipt of the appeal, unless the hearing officer extends the time. The appellant
and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, may appear personally or be represented
by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer.
Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend, in writing, a decision to the Regional
Director. 

(d) The Regional Director may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject
or modify it. In any event, the Regional Director will notify the appellant, and interested persons, if any, of the
decision, and the reason(s) therefor, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended
decision. The Regional Director's action shall constitute final Agency action for the purposes of the Administrative
Procedure Act.

sales, or other transactions involving fish taken or handled by vessels that have permits issued under this part or
that are otherwise subject to this part, including, but not limited to, information concerning: 

(a) The name of the vessel involved in each transaction and the owner or operator of the vessel; 

(b) The amount, number, and size of each species of fish involved in each transaction; and 

(c) The price(s) paid by the buyer and proceeds to the seller in each transaction. 

10. Section 685.18 is added to subpart A to read as follows: 



 685.18

Framework procedures. 



(a) 

Introduction. 

New management measures may be added, through rulemaking, if new information demonstrates that there are biological,
social, or economic concerns in the fishery. The following framework process allows for measures that may affect
operation of the fisheries, gear restrictions, quotas, or reductions or increases in longline catch and/or effort,
if the information supports such a change. Additional information may indicate the need for new management measures
for other sectors of the fishery, such as harvest guidelines, permits for certain classes of vessels, or reporting
requirements. 

(b) 

Annual report

_(1) 

Assessment of the fisheries. 

By June 30 of each year, the Council-appointed Pelagics Plan Team will prepare an annual report on fisheries in the
fishery management area, containing the following: 

(i) Fishery performance data (e.g., landings, effort, value of landings, species composition); 

(ii) Summary of recent research and survey results; 

(iii) Habitat conditions and recent alterations; 

(iv) Enforcement activities and problems; 

(v) Administrative action (e.g., data collection and reporting, permits); 

(vi) State and territorial management actions; and 

(vii) Assessment of need for Council action (including biological, economic, social, enforcement, administrative,
and state/Federal needs, problems, and trends). Indications of potential problems warranting further investigation
may be signaled by indicator criteria. These criteria could include, but are not limited to, important changes in:
Mean size of the catch of any species; estimated ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality for any species; decline
in catch per unit effort by any sector; ex-vessel revenue of any sector; relative proportions of gear in and around
the EEZ; rate of entry/exit of fishermen in the fisheries; revenues for a significant percentage of any sector; total
pelagic landings; species composition of the pelagic landings; research results; habitat or environmental conditions;
or level of interactions between pelagic fishing operations and protected species in the EEZ or surrounding waters;


(viii) Recommendations for Council action; and 

(ix) Estimated impacts of the recommended action. 

(2) 

Recommendations for management action. 

The annual report shall specify any recommendations made by the Pelagics Plan Team to the Council. Recommendations
may cover actions suggested for Federal regulations, state/territorial action, enforcement or administrative
elements, and research and data collection. Recommendations will include an assessment of urgency and the effects
of not taking action and will indicate whether changes involve existing measures, which may be changed under paragraph
(c) of this section, or new measures, which may be implemented under paragraph (d) of this section. 

(c) 

Procedure for changing established measures.

 (1) Established measures are those that are or have been in place via rulemaking procedures for various sectors of
the fisheries, including, but not limited to, requirements governing: Longline general permits; Hawaii longline
limited entry permits; longline logbooks and other reporting requirements; longline area closures; and longline
gear marking requirements. The estimated and potential impacts of these measures have been evaluated in past Fishery
Management Plan amendments and associated documents. 

(2) The Council will identify problems that may warrant action through the annual report described in paragraph (b)(1)
of this section, or a separate report from the Pelagics Plan Team, the Advisory Subpanel, Pelagics Review Board, Scientific
and Statistical Committee, pelagic fishery sector, enforcement officials, NMFS, or other sources. Identified
problems will be addressed as follows: 

(i) At a Council Meeting following completion or receipt of a report identifying a problem, the Council will discuss
whether changes to established conservation and management measures would resolve the problem. Notice to the public
and news media preceding the meeting will indicate that the Council intends to discuss and possibly recommend regulatory
adjustments through the framework process for established measures to address the issue or problem. The notice must
summarize the issue(s) and the basis for recommending the measures being reviewed and would refer interested parties
to the document(s) pertaining to the issue.

(ii) Based on discussions at the meeting, which could include participation by the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Subpanel,
Pelagics Review Board, Scientific and Statistical Committee, or other Council organizations, the Council will
decide whether to recommend action by the Regional Director. 
(iii) The Regional Director will be asked to indicate any special concerns or objections to the possible actions being
considered under the framework process and, if there are any concerns or objections, will be asked for ways to resolve
them. 
(3) If the Council decides to proceed, a document will be prepared describing the problem and the proposed regulatory
adjustment to resolve it. The document will demonstrate how the adjustment is consistent with the purposes of the
established measure and that the impacts had been addressed in the document supporting the original imposition of
the measure. The document will be submitted to the Regional Director with a recommendation for action. The Council
may indicate its intent that the recommendations are to be approved or disapproved as a single action. 
(4) If the Regional Director approves part or all of the Council's recommendation, the Secretary, in accordance with
the Administrative Procedure Act, may implement the approved change in an established measure by publishing a final
rule, waiving advance notice and comment. This does not preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional
opportunity for advance notice and comment, but contemplates that the Council process will satisfy the requirements
of the Magnuson Act and Administrative Procedure Act regarding prior notice and comment. Established measures are
measures that have been evaluated and applied in the past, and adjustments under this framework must be consistent
with the original intent of the measure and within the scope of analysis in previous documents supporting the existing
measure. 
(5) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act. 
(d) 

Procedure for implementing new measures

. (1) New measures are those that have not been used before or measures that, while previously applied, would be applied
to another fishing sector (e.g., non-longline pelagic fishery) or gear type for the first time. New measures may have
been previously considered in a past FMP amendment or document, but the specific impacts on the persons to whom the
measures would newly apply have not been evaluated in the context of current conditions. Potential new measures include,
but are not limited to: Permit requirements for new fishery sectors; reporting requirements for a fishery sector
other than longline fishing; effort limitations; quotas (for total catch or by species), including individual transferable
quotas; fractional licensing; or bycatch limits. 
(2) A Pelagics Plan Team report (annual report or an in-season report), input from advisors, or input from NMFS or other
agencies will first bring attention to a problem or issue that needs to be addressed at the next Council meeting. In
its notice announcing the meeting, the Council will summarize the concern or issue raised, the party that has raised
the problem, and the extent to which it is a new problem or a problem that may require new management measures. The Council
will seek to identify all interested persons and organizations and solicit their involvement in discussion and resolution
of this problem through the Council process, and the Council meeting notice in the 

Federal Register

 will emphasize that this problem will be discussed and that proposed actions may result. 
(3) The document presenting the problem to the attention of the Council will be distributed to all advisory bodies
of the Council who have not yet received it, with a request for comments. The document also will be distributed to the
Council's mailing list associated with the Fishery Management Plan to solicit comments and to indicate the Council
will take up action at the following meeting. The Council's chairperson may request the Council's Pelagics Standing
Committee to discuss the issue and review the comments (if any) of the Pelagics Plan Team, Advisory Panel, Pelagics
Review Board, or Scientific and Statistical Committee, and develop recommendations for Council action. 
(4) At the meeting, the Council will consider the recommendations of its Pelagics Standing Committee, if any, and
other Council organizations and will take comments from the public concerning the possible course of action. If the
Council agrees to proceed with further action under the framework process, the issue will be placed on the agenda for
the following meeting. A document describing the issue, alternative ways to resolve the issue, the preferred action,
and the anticipated impacts of the preferred action, will be prepared and distributed to the public with a request
for comments. A notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 summarizing the Council's deliberations and preferred action and indicating the time and place for the Council meeting
to take final action. 
(5) In its notice for the following meeting, the Council will indicate that it may take final action on the possible
adjustment to regulations under this section. At the meeting, the Council will consider the comments received as
a result of its solicitation of comments and take public comments during the meeting on the issue or problem. The Council
will consider any new information presented or collected and analyzed during the comment period. The Regional Director
will be provided a specific opportunity to indicate any objections or concerns about any or all components of the measures
being considered. The Council will then decide whether to recommend a new measure or measures under this section.

(6) If the Council decides to proceed, it will submit its proposal to the Regional Director for consideration, with
supporting rationale and an analysis of the estimated biological, economic, and social impacts of the proposed actions.
The Council may indicate its intent that all components of its recommendations be approved or disapproved as a single
action. 
(7) If the Regional Director concurs in whole or in part, the Secretary, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, may implement the approved new measure by publishing a final rule, waiving advance notice and comment. Nothing
in this procedure is intended to preclude the Secretary from deciding to provide additional opportunity for advance
notice and comment in the 

Federal Register

, but contemplates, that the Council process (which includes two Council meetings with opportunity for public comment
at each) will satisfy that requirement. 
(8) If a new action is approved and implemented, future adjustments may be made under the procedure for established
measures. 
(9) Nothing in this section limits the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c) of
the Magnuson Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION

: Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These final regulations implement amendments to Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (the
``DPA''), as added by section 5021 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, relating to mergers, acquisitions,
and takeovers of U.S. persons by or with foreign persons, and as amended by section 837 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Year 1993. That amendment requires that the President or his designee undertake an investigation under
Section 721 of certain acquisitions which could result in control of U.S. persons by foreign government controlled
entities. It also expands the factors the President must consider in making a determination under Section 721, modifies
the existing congressional reporting requirement under Section 721, and requires that any designee of the President
under Section 721 share with any other designee a copy of an assessment made in a particular case of the risk of diversion
of a defense critical technology. 


These final regulations implement only those provisions relating to mandatory investigations, and also make a few
technical and conforming changes to the existing regulations. The statutory amendments pertaining to the factors
for Presidential decisionmaking and report sharing, which do not directly affect the behavior of parties filing
under Section 721, were deemed sufficiently straightforward not to require any implementing regulations.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 136 of the Defense Production Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-558) amended section 709 of the DPA
by requiring that any regulation issued under the DPA be published in the 

Federal Register 

 and that opportunity for public comment be provided for not less than thirty days. Although the Treasury Department
elected to provide a sixty day comment period for the regulations originally proposed to implement section 721, it
provided thirty days for public comment on these regulations, in light of their relatively routine nature. The proposed
regulations were published on February 16, 1994; just one written comment was received during the thirty-day comment
period. The preamble to the final regulations has been clarified to reflect this comment, and a few minor changes have
been made to the regulations themselves in response to suggestions from staff members of the Committee on Foreig
