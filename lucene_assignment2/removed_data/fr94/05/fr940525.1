</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes conditional approval of the State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision request submitted by the State of Illinois for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than
or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM). The SIP revision request was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal
requirement for an approvable nonattainment area PM SIP for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas. These areas were designated nonattainment for PM and classified as moderate by the Clean Air Act (Act), upon
enactment of the 1990 Amendments (amended Act). The Act requires that States submit plans by November 15, 1991 for
those areas designated nonattainment and classified as moderate for PM upon enactment (the ``initial moderate nonattainment
areas'').

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM nonattainment areas are set out in title I of the Act
. The USEPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing USEPA's preliminary views on how USEPA intends to review
SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals relating to moderate PM
nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992)). The reader should refer to the General
Preamble for a detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I and the supporting rationale.





Part D of title I contains the provisions applicable to nonattainment areas. Moderate PM nonattainment areas must
meet the applicable requirements of subparts 1 and 4 of part D. Subpart 1 contains provisions generally applicable
to all nonattainment areas and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM nonattainment areas.
At times, Subparts 1 and 4 overlap or conflict. USEPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these various
provisions in the General Preamble and, as appropriate, in this proposed rule.
Those States containing initial moderate PM nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things, the
following provisions by November 15, 1991: 



1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions from existing
sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT)
shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
4. Control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM precursors except where the Administrator
determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections
172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act.
Some additional provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified stationary sources of PM by June 30,
1992 (see section 189(a) of the Act). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15,
1993 which become effective without further action by the State or USEPA, upon a determination by USEPA that the area
has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and
57 FR 13543-13544).


II. This Action


Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing USEPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
USEPA proposes to conditionally approve the plan revision request submitted to USEPA on May 15, 1992, for the Lake
Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas because it strengthens the existing SIP. Public comments
are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. The USEPA will consider any
comments received during the public comment period before taking final action on the requested SIP revision.


A. Analysis of State Submittal


1. Procedural Background


The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans for submission
to USEPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted
after reasonable notice and public hearing.
 Section 110(d) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.





The State of Illinois held a public hearing on October 21, 1991, in Chicago, and on October 29, 1991, in Edwardsville,
Illinois to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas. Following the public hearing the plan was adopted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board on April 9, 1992.
The plan was submitted to USEPA on May 15, 1992, as a revision to the SIP, with a request that USEPA approve the revision.

 The USEPA must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further USEPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part
51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The USEPA attempts to make completeness determinations
within 60 days of receiving a submittal. However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness
determination is not made by USEPA 6 months after receipt of the submission.
The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with
the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The
submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated June 25, 1992, was forwarded to the Manager, Division of Air Pollution
Control, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) indicating the completeness of the submittal and the
next steps to be taken in the review process.


2. Accurate Emissions Inventory


Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. Further, for the
attainment demonstration, the SIP must contain a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions
in the area. Because the submission of an emissions inventory is necessary to an area's attainment demonstration
(or demonstration that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventory must be received with the submission
(see 57 FR 13539).
The emissions inventory for the three nonattainment areas contains emissions data for over 1000 process and fugitive
PM sources. The emissions inventory was received with the submittal of May 15, 1992. The base year for the emissions
inventory is 1991. A review of the emissions inventory has revealed that the emissions data for most emission units
are appropriate. However, USEPA has questioned the emission rates for several sources. The USEPA believes that Illinois
has underestimated emissions from the roof monitors for the Basic Oxygen Furnaces (BOFs) at Granite City Steel (GCS)
and Acme Steel; the quench towers at GCS, Acme Steel, and LTV Steel; the rotary kiln incinerator at CWM Chemical Services;
3 coal fired boilers at CPC International; and, 3 coal fired boilers at GM Electromotive Division. For further information
on the emissions rates, see the Technical Support Documents (TSDs) dated January 10, 1994, and April 25, 1994, available
at the above address.
A detailed description of the process and methodologies used by the IEPA to develop the emission inventory for the
three nonattainment areas was submitted in a report titled ``Emissions Inventory Report for McCook, Lake Calumet,
& Granite City PM Study Areas'' which is part of the docket for this requested SIP revision. The report indicates
that industrial facilities were the primary concern in the three nonattainment areas. These facilities include
metal manufacturers, mineral product manufacturers, food/agriculture facilities, and other PM emitters.


3. RACM (Including RACT)


As noted, states which contain initial moderate PM nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM
(including RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)). The
General Preamble contains a detailed discussion of USEPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement
(see 57 FR 13539-13545 and 13560-13561). The USEPA's interpretation of this requirement is set out here
only in broad terms.
The State should first identify available control measures evaluating them for their reasonableness in light of
the feasibility of the controls and the attainment needs of the area. A State may reject an available control measure
if the measure is technologically infeasible or the cost of the control is unreasonable. The state must demonstrate
that its submitted provisions provide for attainment of the NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than
December 31, 1994 (unless the State demonstrates that attainment by that date is impracticable). Therefore, if a
State adopts less than all available measures but demonstrates, adequately and appropriately, that RFP and attainment
of the PM NAAQS is assured, and application of all such available measures would not result in attainment any faster,
then a plan which requires implementation of less than all available measures may be approved as meeting the RACM requirement.
As a suggested starting point, USEPA has identified reasonably available control measures for sources of fugitive
dust, residential wood combustion, and prescribed burning (see 57 FR 18072-18074 (April 28, 1992)). The State
should add to the list of available measures in an area any measures that public commenters demonstrate may well be
reasonably available in a particular circumstance.
The RACT for a particular source is similarly determined. The USEPA's longstanding definition of RACT is the lowest
emission limitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control technology that
is reasonably available, considering technological and economic feasibility (see 57 FR 13541). Thus, USEPA recommends
that available control technology be applied to those existing sources in the area that are reasonable to control
in light of the attainment needs of the area and the feasibility of controls.






A State should submit a reasoned justification for partial or full rejection of any available control measure (including
any available control technology) that explains, with appropriate documentation, why each rejected control measure
is infeasible or otherwise unreasonable and, therefore, does not constitute RACM (or RACT) for the area. In those
PM nonattainment areas where mobile sources significantly contribute to the PM air quality problem, States also
must address the section 108(f) transportation control measures (see 57 FR 13561).
The submitted control measures for point sources in the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas
include a general grain loading limit of 0.03 grains per standard cubic foot (gr/scf), as well as control measures
for specific sources. The specific control measures consist of regulations that impose grain loading limits, pounds
per ton limits, and pounds per million british thermal units limits (lb/MMBTU). Other control measures for specific
sources are listed in sections 212.324, 212.362, 212.425, 212.458, and 212.464 of Title 35: Environmental Protection;
Subtitle B: Air Pollution; Chapter 1: Pollution Control Board, of the Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC). The
new regulations impose tighter and more enforceable limits than the current SIP approved rules.
Compliance with the above mentioned point source limits will be determined by Method 201 or Method 201A of title 40
of the Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR part 51, appendix M or Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. See 35 IAC 212.108.
The control measures for the area sources consist of opacity limits for roadways, crushing and screening operations,
storage piles, and some material handling operations such as truck loading. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(b) imposes a 10 percent
opacity limit on screening and crushing operations. There is a 10 percent or 5 percent opacity limit on roadways, depending
on the roadway's location. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(d) imposes a 10 percent opacity limit on storage piles. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(e)(2)
imposes additional opacity limits for marine terminals, including a 10 percent opacity limit on truck and railcar
loading. Rule 35 IAC 212.316(f) imposes a 20 percent opacity limit for all sources in the three nonattainment areas
except for certain metal manufacturing and agricultural sources. These regulations impose stricter limits than
the current SIP approved statewide 30 percent opacity limit.
Measurement of opacity from area sources other than roadways and parking areas shall be determined by Method 9, 40
CFR part 60, appendix A. Opacity determinations for roadways and parking areas shall be determined by taking 3 opacity
readings for each vehicle pass. The first reading will be taken at the point of maximum opacity. The second reading
will be taken 5 seconds later and the third reading will be taken another 5 seconds later. After 4 vehicle passes, the
12 readings will be averaged. See 35 IAC 212.109. 
 Illinois must resolve the emissions inventory issues raised in the preceding section and provide a modeled attainment
demonstration which reflects revisions to the emissions inventory. The measures determined to be necessary to demonstrate
attainment will be evaluated by USEPA to determine whether they meet the RACM/RACT requirement.



4. Attainment Demonstration


As noted, for its initial moderate PM nonattainment areas a state must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (See section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31,
1994 is impracticable. In the General Preamble, USEPA indicated that the attainment demonstrations for the initial
moderate areas must follow existing modeling guidelines for PM or, if appropriate, may be developed consistent with
the supplemental attainment demonstration policy issued for initial moderate areas (see 57 FR 13539).
In the development of the three-area modeling analysis, IEPA followed a modeling protocol which had been reviewed
in 1990 by USEPA and found to be consistent with USEPA guidance. The following is a summary of the modeling details.
The Industrial Source Complex short and long term models (ISCST and ISCLT, respectively) were chosen for this analysis
for their ability to handle different source types at multiple locations. ISCST version 90346 was used to perform
the 24-hour PM analysis, and ISCLT version 90008 was used to predict annual PM concentrations. Based on land-use analyses,
IEPA used rural dispersion coefficients for the McCook and Granite City areas, and urban dispersion coefficients
for the Lake Calumet area. As recommended by USEPA guidance, IEPA placed receptors at a resolution of 100 meters at
fencelines and in areas where high impacts had been indicated.
For the Lake Calumet area, IEPA used 5 years of meteorological data from two stations operated by the Lake County (Indiana)
Attainment Task Force in Hammond and Whiting, IN. These sites are representative of the meteorological conditions
at Lake Calumet, since they are nearby and they account for the effects of Lake Michigan. If on-site meteorological
data is not available, USEPA requires the use of at least 5 years of quality-assured data from the nearest or most representative
meteorological site. This practice ensures that potential worst-case meteorological conditions will be identified
and considered in the modeling analysis. Five years of National Weather Service data from Midway Airport was used
for the McCook area, and five years of data from the St. Louis, Missouri airport was used for the Granite City area.
Illinois' emissions inventory included stack sources, process fugitive sources, and open fugitive dust sources.
Generally, Illinois modeled process fugitive sources as volume sources and open fugitive dust sources as area sources
in the ISCST and ISCLT models. Building downwash was considered for those sources affected by nearby building turbulence.
Roof monitors and coke ovens were modeled as series of volume sources. Nonbuoyant process fugitive emission sources
such as crushers, screens, and conveyors were treated as area sources. Open fugitive emissions caused by material
handling and vehicle traffic on both paved and unpaved roads were modeled as area sources. 
IEPA used a screening procedure to evaluate the air quality impacts of sources operating at load levels below maximum
design capacity. Some sources caused maximum impacts at loads less than full capacity. The short term analyses for
the final attainment demonstration employed stack parameters and emission rates which represented the load levels
which gave the greatest ambient impacts. The annual analyses used stack parameters and emission rates which represented
average operating conditions.
Background PM concentrations in the area were determined from local monitored data. Three monitors are located in
the McCook area, three are located in the Lake Calumet area, and five are located in the Granite City area. IEPA used
wind direction information to eliminate portions of the monitored data from the background calculations, in order
to avoid double-counting emissions due to sources explicitly modeled. Growth factors which were developed using
each county's projected increases in vehicular traffic were applied to the background concentrations. Daily background
concentrations were then added to the modeled 24-hour average concentrations to obtain the final predicted totals.
In the long term modeling, Illinois used a single annual background value. The average annual background concentrations
used were 34.08, 28.39, and 29.99 micrograms per cubic meter ( u g/m

3

) for the Lake Calumet, Granite City, and McCook nonattainment areas respectively. 
In the submitted modeled demonstrations, which use 5 years of meteorological data, a violation of the 24 hour NAAQS
is indicated when six exceedances of the 24 hour standard are predicted. The 24 hour PM standard is 150  u g/m

3

. Each receptor's predicted sixth highest 24 hour value is, therefore, compared to the standard. The highest, sixth
highest predicted 24 hour PM concentration at any receptor in the McCook area was 145.6 micrograms per cubic meter
( u g/m

3

), in the Lake Calumet area, 145.2  u g/m

3

, and in the Granite City area, 147.8  u g/m

3

. Thus, the modeling analysis predicts that the 24 hour NAAQS will be protected for all three areas. A modeled violation
of the annual PM standard is indicated when any receptor's 5 year arithmetic mean annual PM concentration exceeds
the annual PM standard of 50  u g/m

3

. The highest arithmetic mean annual PM concentration predicted by the modeling for the McCook area was 49.9  u g/m

3

, for the Lake Calumet area, 46.9  u g/m

3

, and for the Granite City area, 49.0  u g/m

3

. Therefore, the annual PM NAAQS will be protected in these areas.
Because of the length of time it may take to determine whether an area has attained the standards, USEPA recommends
that PM nonattainment area SIP submittals demonstrate maintenance of the PM NAAQS for at least 3 years beyond the applicable
attainment date. (See a August 20, 1991, memorandum from Fred H. Renner, Jr. to Regional Air Branch Chiefs titled ``Questions
and Answers for Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, and Lead'') While Illinois' submittal did take growth into account
in the modeling analysis, it did not adequately address maintenance of the NAAQS for PM in the nonattainment areas.

 The refined air quality modeling analysis supplied by IEPA in support of the Illinois PM plan indicates that the NAAQS
for PM will be protected under the proposed PM control strategies. As mentioned previously, Illinois must resolve
the issues pertaining to the emissions inventory and, where necessary, prepare a revised attainment demonstration
including a demonstration that the NAAQS will be maintained for 3 years beyond the attainment date. The control strategy
used to control PM emissions is summarized in the section of this notice titled ``RACM (including RACT)''. For a more
detailed description of the attainment demonstration and control strategy used, see the TSDs prepared in support
of this proposed rule.


5. PM Precursors


The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM must also apply to major stationary
sources of PM precursors, unless USEPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM levels which
exceed the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). The control requirements that apply to major stationary
sources in PM nonattainment areas generally include the following: reasonably available control technology, which
applies in moderate PM nonattainment areas; best available control technology, which applies in serious PM nonattainment
areas; and control requirements under the applicable new source review provisions, such as the lowest achievable
emission rate. The General Preamble contains a lengthy discussion on control requirements for PM precursors in moderate
nonattainment areas and on the type of technical information USEPA will rely on in making any determinations under
section 189(e) (see 57 FR 13539-13540 and 13541-13542). 
 Weather stagnation is not characteristic of the three nonattainment areas. Reduction of precursor concentrations
would require reduction of indeterminately located sources well upwind of the nonattainment area. Control of precursors
in the nonattainment area would have little if any impact on particulate matter concentrations in the nonattainment
area. For this reason, it is appropriate to conclude that precursors do not contribute significantly to particulate
matter concentrations in the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas. Note that while USEPA is
making a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character of the area including, for
example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future growth could change the significance
of precursors in the area. The USEPA intends to issue future guidance addressing such potential changes in the significance
of precursor emissions in an area.


6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress (RFP)



The PM nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones, which
are to be achieved every 3 years, until the area is redesignated attainment. The plan must also demonstrate RFP, as
defined in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). Reasonable further
progress is defined in section 171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by part D or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable date.
USEPA has indicated (see 57 FR 13539) that for the initial moderate PM nonattainment areas, the emissions reductions
progress made between the SIP submittal due date of November 15, 1991 and the attainment date of December 31, 1994,
(only 46 days beyond the November 15, 1994 milestone date) will satisfy the first milestone requirement. The de minimis
timing differential makes it administratively impracticable to require separate milestone and attainment demonstrations.
In implementing RFP for an initial moderate area, USEPA will review the attainment demonstration and control strategy
for the area and determine whether annual incremental reductions different from those provided in the SIP may reasonably
be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM NAAQS by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1)). The control strategy
for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas went into effect on May 11, 1993. At this time, it
is unknown if RFP has been achieved because a revised attainment demonstration is still pending. USEPA will make any
such determination in a separate action. 


7. Enforceability


All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable both by the State and USEPA. See sections 172(c)(6),
110(a)(2)(A) and 57 FR 13556. The USEPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated
in a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, et.
al., entitled ``Review of State Implementation Plans and Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency''
and with an attached memo with the same date and title which contained more detailed guidance from the Associate Enforcement
Counsel for Air Enforcement et. al. (see discussion at 57 FR 13541). The criteria include, for example, applicability
to sources, compliance date(s), compliance periods, test methods, recordkeeping requirements, and any exemptions
or variances. In addition to enforceable requirements, nonattainment area plan provisions must contain a program
that provides for enforcement of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
The particular control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under the section headed ``RACM (including
RACT).'' These control measures apply to the types of activities identified in that discussion, including, for example,
grain loading limits, pound per ton limits, and lb/MMBTU limits for point sources and opacity limits for roadways
and storage piles. The SIP provides that these control measures apply to the areas defined in section 212.324(a)(1).
These areas match the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment areas.
The State of Illinois uses two approaches to regulate PM emissions, ``testing'' and ``observation''. Testing is
the common approach to control particulate matter from large process emission sources. In this approach the emission
limit is set as allowable concentration, e.g. grain/scf, or an allowable emission factor, e.g. lbs/ton throughput.
Compliance with the emission limit is evaluated by initial emissions testing using an appropriate method. For PM,
the appropriate test methods are Method 201 and Method 201A of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M or Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60,
appendix A. Method 202 of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M is used if condensibles is also to be tested. Besides emissions tests,
compliance is determined by a combination of techniques, including reviewing operating records, observation of
stack opacity, and monitoring of stack opacity. These techniques are used to assure that the equipment is being operated
in a manner that is consistent with that used during testing. If the manner of operation deviates significantly from
that used during testing, the equipment must be restored to the manner of operation used during testing or the equipment
must be tested again. There are recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are used to help verify proper operation
and maintenance of the control equipment.
The second approach to control of particulate matter emissions, relies solely on visual observation of the exhaust.
This ``observation'' approach is particularly relevant where existing or small sources are being considered. This
approach determines whether or not visible emissions from equipment have exceeded opacity limitations.
Upon review of Illinois' submittal, USEPA has identified several enforcement concerns. They are as follows:



a. On December 29, 1992, USEPA approved general opacity limitations for the State of Illinois. See 57 FR 61834. These
opacity limitations are found at subpart B under 35 IAC 212. Subpart B of 35 IAC 212 is a recodification of the former
Rule 202. These regulations impose a 30 percent opacity limit for most sources.
The coke oven regulations of the Illinois SIP exempt coke oven sources from all of Rule 202 of the State of Illinois Air
Pollution Control Regulations. This exemption in the state regulations was approved on September 3, 1981, (46 FR
44177) as Rule 203(d)(5)(B)(i) and is now codified as 35 IAC 212.443(a).
Currently, PM emissions from coke oven combustion stacks in Illinois are limited to 0.05 grains per dry standard cubic
foot (gr/dscf). USEPA conditionally approved this limit on September 3, 1981. Currently, coke oven combustion stacks
exist at LTV Steel, GCS, and Acme Steel. The LTV combustion stack is limited to a 0.03 gr/dscf by a Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) permit.
USEPA inspectors have observed emissions of greater than 60 percent opacity at the LTV Steel coke oven combustion
stack. As recent stack tests have confirmed, this stack is not in compliance with its mass limit while emitting at this
opacity. However, without the benefit of an opacity limit, enforcement was delayed for months until stack test results
were obtained, even after high opacity emissions were observed. An opacity limit on this stack will better assure
compliance with the grain loading limit.
To better assure compliance with the grain loading limit, the State needs to impose an opacity limit on the coke oven
combustion stacks that is reflective of their mass emission limit. 
b. USEPA considers the rules that apply to the electric arc furnace roof vents at American Steel Foundries to be unenforceable
because the stacks can not be tested for compliance. IEPA should develop an enforceable limit that is reflective of
the emissions which are in the modeled attainment demonstration.
c. Section 212.107, Measurement Methods for Visible Emissions, states that Method 22 should be used for ``detection
of visible emissions''. This could be misinterpreted as requiring use of Method 22 for sources subject to opacity
limits as well as sources subject to limits on detectability of visible emissions. USEPA recommends revising the
language of the rule to state that ``For both process emission sources and fugitive particulate matter sources, a
determination as to the presence or absence of visible emissions shall be in accordance with Method 22 ...''.
d. Measurement methods for opacity, visible emissions, and ``PM'' are in section 212.110, and in separate sections
212.107, 212.108, and 212.109. The measurement methods in these sections are not always consistent with each other.
USEPA recommends that the measurement methods in 212.107, 212.108, and 212.109 be integrated with section 212.110.
e. Several of the submitted rules contain language which exempts sources with no visible emissions from mass emissions
limits. It is USEPA's understanding that the State intends for these exemptions to apply to small, well-controlled
sources. However, the way the exemptions are worded, they could be misinterpreted to exclude many other sources from
mass emissions limits. The rules containing these exemptions need to be more clear about exactly what sources are
to be exempt, and when.


8. Contingency Measures


As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13543-13544. These measures were required to be submitted
by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. On January 21, 1994, the USEPA made a finding that
Illinois had failed to submit the required PM contingency measures. If Illinois does not make a complete submission
of these contingency measures within 18 months of the findings letter, USEPA will be mandated to use its authority
under section 179(a) of the Act to impose at least one sanction identified in section 179(b) of the Act in the affected
nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures that are not part of the area's
current control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State or USEPA, upon a determination
by USEPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The USEPA will
take separate rulemaking action on the contingency plan for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City nonattainment
areas.


III. USEPA's Proposed Rulemaking Action


The USEPA proposes to grant conditional approval to the plan revision submitted to USEPA by the State of Illinois on
May 15, 1992, for the Lake Calumet, McCook, and Granite City PM nonattainment areas. Illinois' requested SIP revision
does not include a complete and accurate emissions inventory, which, in turn, leads to an unacceptable attainment
demonstration. However, the submitted regulations do require stricter limitations than the current applicable
SIP.
The conditional approval is based on the State's enforceable commitment to meet five requirements within one year
from the date of final conditional approval. The State submitted a letter on March 2, 1994, committing to meet these
requirements within one year of final conditional approval. The first requirement is for the State to adopt additional
enforceable control measures, if necessary, that will achieve attainment. The second requirement is for the State
to submit a complete and accurate emissions inventory (including corrected emissions estimates, as well as any new
control measures which may be needed) and an acceptable modeled attainment demonstration. The third requirement
is for the State to impose an opacity limit for coke oven combustion stacks which is reflective of their mass emission
limits. The fourth requirement is for the State to provide an appropriate regulation for the electric arc furnaces
at American Steel Foundries. The fifth requirement is for the State to correct the three other enforcement concerns
listed above as c-e under the heading ``Enforceability''. 
If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment within one year of final conditional approval, then USEPA's action
for the State's requested SIP revision will automatically convert to a final limited approval/disapproval. The
limited approval would entail approval of the submitted regulations into the Illinois SIP for their strengthening
effect, and disapproval of the attainment demonstration and the emissions inventory. 


IV. Request for Public Comments


USEPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. As indicated at the outset of this notice, USEPA
will consider any comments received by June 24, 1994.


V. Processing Procedures


This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12991 for a period of 2 years.
The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866.
Nothing in this action should be constructed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future
request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.


VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal; cancellation of the public hearings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 24, 1994, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) published a proposed rule proposing
to impose sanctions on Indiana under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under the Clean Air Act as amended
in 1990 (Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt and submit an enhanced motor vehicle inspection
and maintenance (I/M) State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision as required by the Act for the Lake and Porter County
ozone nonattainment areas. The Indiana legislature passed the legislation required to support such a SIP revision
and on March 4, 1994, Indiana Governor Bayh signed the legislation. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing
the January 24, 1994, proposed rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. In addition, USEPA
is also canceling the previously announced public hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February
18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22, 1994, in Indianapolis which were postponed on February 15, 1993, by USEPA
because of significant progress made by the Indiana Legislature toward adoption of necessary legislation up to that
date. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3544), USEPA published a proposed rule proposing to impose sanctions on the State of Indiana
under the discretionary authority granted USEPA under section 110(m) of the Act for failure by the State to meet its
commitment to adopt and submit an I/M SIP revision as required by the amended Act for the Lake and Porter County ozone
nonattainment area. USEPA had notified Indiana by letter dated December 30, 1993 of its finding that Indiana had failed
to submit the required I/M SIP revision.



The Indiana legislature subsequently passed Senate Bill 285 to support such a SIP revision, and on March 4, 1994, Indiana
Governor Bayh signed the Bill. Because of this favorable action, USEPA is withdrawing the January 24, 1994, proposed
rule initiating the process to impose discretionary sanctions. The USEPA is also canceling the previously announced
hearings scheduled for February 16, 1994, in Valparaiso; for February 18, 1994, in New Albany; and for February 22,
1994, in Indianapolis. This withdrawal terminates the discretionary sanctions process initiated by the January
24, 1994, proposed rule. The mandatory sanctions process under section 179 of the Act initiated by USEPA's December
30, 1993, finding that Indiana failed to submit the required SIP revision is not affected by this action. Under that
process, USEPA must impose sanctions within a certain time frame unless Indiana adopts and formally submits a complete
I/M SIP revision. Because of the recent March 8, 1994 United States Court of Appeals order concerning the issue of I/M
committal SIPs, (

NRDC

 v. 

EPA

, D.C. Cir. No. 92-1596) if Indiana does not submit a complete SIP by the July 15, 1994 deadline established by
the court, the State of Indiana will be subject to sanctions pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7509.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
Maryland; New Source Review Regulations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a limited approval/disapproval action of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of Maryland. This revision establishes and requires major new and modified sources of volatile organic
compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) to meet the new source requirements which include the installation of Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) technology
and to obtain emission offsets. The intended effect of this action is to propose limited approval of new source review
requirements for major new and modified sources in Maryland for the limited purpose of strengthening the Maryland
SIP which currently has regulations which do not meet the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. In addition, this action
is intended to propose disapproval of Maryland Regulations COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing Maryland
the opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the regulations which result in its failure to meet all requirements
of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is being taken in accordance with the provisions of section 110 of the Clean Air
Act.
 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 8, 1993, the Maryland Department of the Environment submitted a revision to its State Implementation Plan
(SIP) pertaining to requirements for major new and modified sources of VOC and NO

x

 applicable statewide. 



The revision consists of modifications to COMAR 26.11.01.01 (Definitions), 26.11.02 (Permits, Approvals and Registration)
sections .03, .09-.11, and .18, and an entirely new regulation, COMAR 26.11.17 (Requirements for Major New
Sources and Modifications). The modifications to COMAR 26.11.01.01 remove a portion of the definition of ``modification''
which was inconsistent with the Federal definition contained in 40 CFR 51.165, EPA's guidance to states on new source
requirements. In addition, Maryland introduces the term ``Major New Source Requiring Approval (MNSRA)'' which
is defined as a major stationary source or major modification subject to requirements in COMAR 26.11.17. COMAR 26.11.17
is an entirely new regulation in Maryland meant to replace its previous new source requirements which were located
in COMAR 26.11.06.11, General Emission Standards, Prohibitions and Restrictions-New Source Impacting on
a Nonattainment Area (NSINA) Prohibition for Areas III and IV. The proposed revisions to the Maryland SIP were submitted
in response to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended on November 15, 1990. The only nonattainment areas
in Maryland are those designated nonattainment for ozone and those designated nonattainment for carbon monoxide.
The Clean Air Act requires that all states which have areas designated nonattainment for ozone or carbon monoxide
(CO), or states located in the Ozone Transport Region, to submit to EPA, by November 15, 1992 or November 15, 1993, respectively,
a revision to their SIPs which would require major new and major modified sources of those pollutants to meet new source
requirements. 



Background


Federal Requirements


According to section 172(c)(5), state implementation plans must require permits for the construction and operation
of new or modified major stationary sources. The statutory permit requirements for ozone nonattainment areas are
generally contained in revised section 173, and in subpart 2 of part D. EPA is planning to update its new source review
rule for nonattainment areas in 40 CFR 51.165 and 52.24 in accordance with the Clean Air Act, as amended on November
15, 1990. At that time, states, including Maryland, will be expected to evaluate their new source regulations in accordance
with those new source rules and revise their regulations accordingly. 

The requirements for new sources in nonattainment areas under sections 172, 173, 182, and 184 of the Act, include the
following:



a. According to section 173(a)(1), provisions in the state regulation to assure that calculations of emissions offsets
are based on the same emissions baseline used in the demonstration of RFP. 
b. According to section 173(c)(1), states may include provisions which allow offsets to be obtained in another nonattainment
area if the area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification and emissions from the other nonattainment area
contribute to a NAAQS violation in the area in which the source would construct.
c. According to section 173(c)(1), provisions in the state regulation that any emissions offsets obtained in conjunction
with the issuance of a permit to a new or modified source must be in effect and enforceable by the time the new or modified
source commences operation. This statutory condition for offsets augments the existing requirement under section
173 that provides that offsets must be federally-enforceable before permit issuance, although the required emissions
reductions need not occur until the date on which the new or modified source commences operations.
d. According to section 173(c)(1), provisions in the state regulation to assure that emissions increases from new
or modified sources must be offset by real reductions in actual emissions. EPA's initial guidance interpreting general
sections of the Clean Air Act is contained in the title I General Preamble published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498). In the General Preamble, EPA reiterated that emission increases and decreases for
netting are to be determined consistent with EPA's current new source rules and the December 4, 1986 emissions trading
policy statement (51 FR 43823). In addition, pre-enactment reductions are expected to be treated as new source growth,
even though, for applicability purposes, the source's net emissions change is de minimis. EPA's current new source
rules state that a decrease in emissions is only creditable if, among other requirements, the decrease has not been
relied upon by the state for any permit, attainment demonstration, or reasonable further progress. Therefore, emission
reductions made because of RACT or other requirements which have been taken into account in the state's demonstration
of reasonable further progress or attainment demonstration are not creditable for netting purposes.
e. According to section 173(c)(2), provisions in the state regulation to prevent emission reductions otherwise
required by the Act from being credited for purposes of satisfying part D offset requirements.
f. According to section 173(a)(5), provisions in the state regulation that, as a prerequisite to issuing any part
D permit, require an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques
for proposed sources that demonstrate that the benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental
and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.
g. According to section 328, provisions in the state regulation to assure that sources located on the OCS are subject
to the same requirements applicable if the source were located in the corresponding onshore area.
h. Provisions in the state regulation to assure that owners or operators of each proposed new or modified major stationary
source demonstrate the compliance of all other major stationary sources under the same ownership in the State.
i. Provisions in the state regulation defining major new and major modified sources in accordance with the area's
nonattainment classification under section 181 for ozone and section 186 for CO. j. Provisions in the state regulation
requiring emission offsets for major new and major modified sources in accordance with the area's nonattainment
classification under section 181 for ozone and section 186 for CO. 
k. Provisions in the state regulation requiring all applicable new source requirements for sources locating in the
Ozone Transport Region. For a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area located in the transport region, the major
stationary source size thresholds applicable to those areas apply for VOC and, presumptively, for NO

x

. These provisions must also ensure that new or modified major stationary sources obtain VOC and, presumptively,
NO

x

 offsets at a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1 in order to obtain an NSR permit. Higher offset ratios apply in areas classified
as serious or above. 
l. Provisions in the state regulation to ensure that any new or modified major stationary source of NO

x

 satisfies the requirements applicable to any new or modified major stationary source of VOC, unless a special NO

x

 exemption is granted by the Administrator under the provision of section 182(f).
m. For serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas, state plans must implement sections 182(c)(6), (7) and (8) with
regard to modifications.



Nonattainment Area Requirements as They Pertain to Maryland 


The Clean Air Act requirements under section 182, as they pertain to new sources in Maryland, specify that major sources
in the Baltimore severe ozone nonattainment area (Baltimore City, Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Carroll, Harford, and
Howard Counties) and in the Maryland portion of the Philadelphia severe ozone nonattainment area (Cecil County,
Maryland) be defined as those whose potential emissions of VOC are greater than or equal to 25 tons per year (TPY). In
addition, major sources in the Washington DC serious ozone nonattainment area (Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery,
and Prince George's Counties) are defined as those whose potential emissions of VOC are greater than or equal to 50
TPY. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act also requires that wherever sources of VOC are required to be controlled, nitrogen
oxide (NO

x

) sources of the same size thresholds are required to be controlled. Therefore, in the Baltimore, Philadelphia, and
Washington DC ozone nonattainment areas, NO

x

 sources which have the potential to emit greater than or equal to 25 TPY, 25 TPY, and 50 TPY, respectively, are required
to be subject to new source requirements. Section 184 of the Clean Air Act also establishes, by operation of law, the
Ozone Transport Region (OTR), consisting of the states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Area that includes the District of Columbia. The section 182 ozone nonattainment area requirements applicable to
moderate ozone nonattainment areas apply, at a minimum, in those areas located in the OTR. Section 184(b)(2) requires,
however, that instead of the 100 TPY major source threshold required in moderate areas outside the OTR, major sources
in the OTR be defined as those with potential emissions of 50 tons of VOC per year or more. Therefore, the remaining counties
in Maryland which are designated attainment for ozone but are located in the OTR, are required to apply new source requirements
to sources of VOC which have the potential to emit at least 50 tons of VOC per year. The Maryland counties which are designated
attainment but are located in the OTR are: Allegany, Caroline, Dorchester, Garrett, Kent, Queen Anne's, Somerset,
St. Mary's, Talbot, Washington, Wicomico, and Worcester Counties. In these areas, the CAA's 50 ton threshold for
VOC does not apply and the major NO

x

 sources are defined as those which have the potential to emit at least 100 tons of NO

x

 per year. 

For its carbon monoxide nonattainment area, Maryland is required to define a major source of CO as one which has the
potential to emit at least 100 tons of CO per year. Installation of LAER and emission offsets at a greater than 1 to 1 ratio
are required for major new or major modified sources. 



EPA Analysis



Maryland's proposed changes to COMAR 26.11.01.01, Definitions, and 26.11.02 primarily relate to inserting the
new term for major sources, ``Major New Source Requiring Approval (MNSRA)'' and deleting the old term, ``New Source
Impacting on a Nonattainment Area (NSINA)''. The new term and definition are consistent with the Act. 
 One substantive change made in COMAR 26.11.01.01 was to delete the portion of the definition of ``Modification''
which would consider an increase in hours of operation or in production rate as a modification unless those increases
are prohibited under any permit or approval conditions ``adopted by the Department.'' The Federal definition specifically
excludes increases in hours of operation or in production rate from being considered a modification for new source
applicability purposes unless those increases are prohibited under any federally enforceable condition. Maryland's
definition of ``Modification'' clarifies that the permits and approvals are those that are federally enforceable,
rather than just those adopted by the Department. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the ``Modification'' definition
in COMAR 26.11.01.01. EPA is also proposing to approve the other changes to COMAR 26.11.01.01 and 26.11.02. COMAR
26.11.02.18 contains a permit fee schedule for new or modified sources which Maryland has requested not be included
as part of the SIP approval. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve COMAR 26.11.02, with the exception of .18. 

Maryland's new proposed regulation, COMAR 26.11.17, contains the applicability criteria for determining what
sources would be considered major new or major modified sources for the purposes of applying new source requirements.
This regulation generally meets the requirement pertaining to baseline consistency with the RFP demonstration
by requiring all sources to treat emission reductions which occurred prior to January 1, 1991 as not creditable. 

COMAR 26.11.71.04 E provides that emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or permanently
curtailing production or operating hours below baseline levels are creditable if the reductions are permanent,
quantifiable, and federally enforceable, and only if such reductions occurred on or after January 1, 1991. However,
existing EPA regulations also provide that if a state does not have an EPA-approved attainment demonstration, then
post-January 1, 1991 reductions achieved by a shutdown or curtailment of production or operating hours are only creditable
if the state is current in its attainment planning obligations. See 54 FR 27286 (June 28, 1989). EPA's current rules
also require that even in nonattainment areas with approved attainment demonstrations, only those shutdown or curtailment
credits generated after the date of permit application are creditable. See 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. Therefore,
EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the purpose of allowing Maryland the opportunity to correct
this provision by adding a requirement that in the absence of an approved attainment demonstration, Maryland must
be current in it attainment planning obligations in order for post-January 1, 1991 shutdown reductions to be creditable,
and to clarify that only post-application reductions are creditable.

EPA will be seeking comments in its 40 CFR parts 51 and 52 rulemaking on whether there is a need, in light of the revised
baseline date in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, to revisit the fundamental policies underlying the limitation
on the use of shutdown and curtailment credits for areas without approved attainment demonstrations. These policies
are reflected in EPA's current regulation at  51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C), that were the subject of two earlier rulemakings
in 1980 and 1989. See 45 FR 52676 (August 7, 1980) and 54 FR 27274 (June 28, 1989). EPA notes that the Clean Air Act Advisory
Committee may independently review concerns about the effect of the NSR program on industrial growth in nonattainment
areas. These concerns include the crediting and availability of, among other things, emissions offsets. In particular,
EPA is taking comments on whether the current policy on the use of shutdown credits unevenly impacts urban vs. suburban
areas, including issues related to urban sprawl, commuting patterns, and demographics. Upon final EPA rulemaking
on parts 51 and 52, Maryland will have to amend its rule to the extent such amendment is required to make its new source
review rule consistent with that final rulemaking.

In addition, all sources located in the Maryland portion of the Philadelphia ozone nonattainment area and in the Baltimore
and Washington DC ozone nonattainment areas, as well as sources located in the remainder of the state which are one
of the sources in the source categories listed in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, are required to include fugitive emissions
``to the extent quantifiable'' in the calculation of potential emissions. EPA understands the definition of fugitive
emissions, as provided for in the Maryland regulations, and as here modified by the phrase ``to the extent quantifiable,
to mean that emissions that could reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally equivalent
opening are not fugitive for NSR applicability threshold calculation purposes, regardless of whether those emission
actually pass through a stack, etc. See e.g., 40 CFR 51.166(b)(19). For example, an enclosed facility may have numerous
VOC emission points none of which is individually vented. If those emissions reasonably could be individually vented
or vented collectively through one or more stacks in this roof of the building, those emissions would not be fugitive
within the meaning of the Maryland regulations and must be considered in determining whether the source is major for
NSR purposes. In determining whether emissions could pass through a stack, etc..., ``reasonableness'' is to be broadly
construed. Thus, for any source category subject to a national standard under sections 111 and 112 that requires collection
and/or venting of emissions points, emission from such sources are not fugitive, because the collection/venting
requirement in that standard is deemed to be reasonable. Likewise, if the Maryland SIP or a permit issued by the state
requires collection/venting of certain emissions, this creates a presumption that similar emissions from any other
source in that category could also reasonably pass through a stack, etc., and, therefore, should not be considered
fugitive. 

 COMAR 26.11.17.04 F. establishes the criteria for the location of VOC or NO

x

 offsets such that offsets must be obtained from the same ozone nonattainment area, as close to the proposed new source
as possible, and may be obtained from another ozone nonattainment area if that area is of an equal or higher classification
and if the emissions from this area contributes to a violation in the nonattainment area of the proposed new source.
This provision is consistent with the requirements of the Act.

COMAR 26.11.17.01 contains requirements that emissions offsets for proposed major new sources or major modified
sources be obtained no later than the time of commencement of construction of the major new or major modified source.
COMAR 26.11.17.05 requires that these emission offsets be state and federally enforceable by the new source's ``start-up
date.'' Section 173 of the CAA provides, however, that offsets are to be federally-enforceable before the permit
may be issued, even though such offsets need actually occur no later than the date the new source would commence operations.
Therefore, EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the purpose of allowing Maryland to correct
this provision so as to provide for Federal-enforceability of offsets before permit issuance.

COMAR 26.11.17.04 establishes the baseline for offsets as the actual emissions in the preceding 1 or 2 year period,
or some other period approved by the Department if more representative of normal source operations, but not to exceed
the SIP emission limitations. The effect of this requirement is to establish the baseline for offsets as the lower
of actual or SIP allowable emissions. Sources with no applicable SIP limitation are required to use actual emissions
as the baseline. Sources with SIP emission limitations that exceed their uncontrolled emissions must use the SIP
emission limitations as the baseline. The Maryland regulation does not satisfy the Clean Air Act requirement that
emission reductions otherwise required by the Act are not creditable for part D offsets. Therefore, EPA is proposing
a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 so that Maryland can correct this deficiency by modifying its regulation
by specifically stating that only those emission reductions not otherwise required by the Act are creditable for
emission offsets required by this regulation. 

With regard to emission decreases which are creditable for netting, Maryland's regulation contains the condition
that emission decreases are only creditable if, among other requirements, they have not been relied upon by the state
for any permit, attainment demonstration, or reasonable further progress. COMAR 26.11.17.01, pertaining to netting
calculations, clearly requires emission reductions to be real so that actual emission reductions are obtained.
Therefore, the Maryland regulation satisfies the current Federal requirements for netting.


 COMAR 26.11.17.03 requires sources to perform an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and
environmental control techniques in order to demonstrate that the benefits of the proposed source significantly
outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction or modification. COMAR
26.11.17.03 also requires all sources owned and operated by the proposed new source's applicant to be in compliance
with all applicable emission limitations or in compliance with an approved federally enforceable compliance plan.
COMAR 26.11.17.01 (5) defines building, structure, facility or installation as including those activities on the
outer continental shelf to the extent required by and consistent with section 328 of the Act. EPA is proposing to approve
these three provisions as they meet the Act's requirements.

Maryland's regulation defines major new and major modified sources of VOC and NO

x

 (for ozone nonattainment areas and areas located in the OTR) and CO consistent with the requirements of the Act. Emission
offset ratios for each of these pollutants, consistent with the Act, are also required. The Maryland regulation pertaining
to applicability and emission offsets for ozone nonattainment areas and in the OTR is, however, not completely clear
in indicating that a source which emits both VOC and NO

x

 is potentially subject to new source requirements for both VOC and NO

x

. A source emitting both VOC and NO

x

 determines applicability of VOC requirements by individually summing its VOC emissions and comparing such sum to
the major source size threshold for VOC or the significance levels for VOC for major modifications. This source would
also be required to individually sum its NO

x

 emissions and determine applicability by comparing this sum to the major source size threshold for NO

x

 or the significance levels for NO

x

 for major modifications. Likewise, VOC and NO

x

 sources which are required to obtain emission offsets must obtain offsets of the same type of pollutant (i.e. VOC for
VOC and NO

x

 for NO

x

). Maryland may choose to retain the applicability determination to sum both VOC and NO

x

 emissions at a source to determine new source applicability since this is more stringent than the Federal requirements.
Maryland must, however, require that emission offsets are obtained for the same pollutant as that which is increased.
For this reason, EPA is proposing a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 in order to allow Maryland the opportunity
to clarify the applicability and the creditability of emission offsets.

The Maryland regulation also states that nothing in the regulation itself is meant to conflict with sections 182(c)(7)
and (8) of the Clean Air Act. These two sections of the Act pertain to de minimis provisions which would allow sources
located in serious or severe ozone nonattainment areas to opt out of Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) technology
if they obtain 1.3 to 1 internal offsets. Maryland has chosen to incorporate the requirements of section 182(c)(6),
pertaining to determining de minimis levels in serious and severe ozone nonattainment areas, into its regulation
at COMAR 26.11.17.01. Until EPA issues its new source rule, the Maryland regulation as written is approvable. As mentioned
earlier, when EPA issues its new source rule, Maryland will be expected to evaluate its regulation for consistency
with that rule and make any appropriate changes to its regulation.

Maryland's proposed regulation also appropriately defines major new carbon monoxide sources to obtain LAER and
emission offsets at a minimum of 1.1 to 1 in CO nonattainment areas. These nonattainment areas are defined in 40 CFR
81.321 and located in the Baltimore and metropolitan Washington DC areas. EPA is proposing to approve these CO provisions,
as they meet the Act's requirements.

Because of the above deficiencies, pertaining to applicability determinations, emission offset calculations,
and eligibility of emission reduction credits, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 110(k)(3)
and part D. Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements
of the CAA, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited
approval of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt
regulations necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action
also contains a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does not meet the section 182(a)(2)(A)
requirement of part D because of the noted deficiencies. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited
approval of Maryland's submitted COMAR 26.11.01.01 and 26.11.17 under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the CAA.

At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of the Maryland new source rule because it contains implementation
problems and deficiencies which result in less than the full population of required major new sources to be regulated,
and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of part D of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2), if the Administrator
disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based on the submission's failure
to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one of the sanctions set forth in
section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval. Section 179(b) provides
two sanctions available to the Administrator: Highway funding and offsets. The 18 month period referred to in section
179(a) will begin at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover, the final disapproval triggers
the 24-month Federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c).

EPA's review of this material indicates that COMAR 26.11.01.01, COMAR 26.11.17.02, .09-.11 are fully approvable.
EPA is proposing to approve COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of strengthening the Maryland SIP with respect
to new source requirements in nonattainment areas and areas located in the ozone transport region. EPA is also proposing
a limited disapproval of COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing Maryland the opportunity to correct the
above-identified deficiencies in the regulation so that the regulation can meet Clean Air Act requirements. If Maryland
corrects the specific deficiencies cited above and submits the corrected regulation to EPA prior to the final rulemaking
action, EPA intends to take final action on the June 8, 1993 submittal and the subsequent submittal which corrects
the Maryland new source regulation, without another proposal. Of course, in the event that the parts 51 and 52 rulemaking
is finalized prior to final action on this submittal, Maryland's new source review regulations may be subject to reproposal.
Further discussion of the Maryland new source review regulation is contained in the accompanying technical support
document. EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this document or on other relevant matters.
These comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal
rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this document.



Proposed Action


EPA is proposing to approve the COMAR 26.11.01.01, 26.11.02. sections .03, .09-.11, and COMAR 26.11.17 (with
the exception of 26.11.17.18), pertaining to new source review requirements in nonattainment areas and in the ozone
transport region. At the same time, EPA is also proposing to disapprove COMAR 26.11.17 for the limited purpose of allowing
Maryland to correct deficiencies in the regulation such that the Act's requirements can be met. 
 
 Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C.
603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The USEPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove this SIP revision, pertaining to Maryland's new source review
regulations, will be based on whether it meets the requirements of
section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K), and part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule extends the time frame providers 
have to file cost reports from no later than 3 months after 
the close of the period covered by the report to no later 
than 5 months after the close of that period. This change 
is necessary to ensure that providers have an adequate 
amount of time to file complete and accurate cost reports. 
We are also proposing to define what HCFA considers to be an 
``acceptable'' cost report submission.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Section 1815(a) of the Social Security Act (the Act) 
requires that each provider participating in the Medicare 
program submit information (as requested by the Secretary) 
in order to determine the amount of payment due to the 
provider for services furnished under the Medicare program. 
Implementing regulations at 42 CFR 413.24(f) require that 
participating providers submit cost reports that generally 
cover a consecutive 12-month period of the provider's 
operations. Section 102 of the Provider Reimbursement 
Manual (PRM), HCFA Publication 15-II, states that a provider 
may select any annual period for Medicare cost reporting 
purposes regardless of the reporting period it uses for 
other purposes. Once a provider has informed HCFA of its 
selection, HCFA requires it to report annually thereafter 
for periods ending on the same date unless that provider's 
intermediary approves a change in the provider's reporting 
period. The intermediary makes interim payments to the 
provider during the provider's cost reporting year. Based 
on the annual cost report, a retroactive adjustment is made 
after the end of the provider's cost reporting year to bring 
the interim payments made during the period into agreement 
with the reimbursable amount payable to the provider.
Section 413.24(f)(2)(i) specifies that cost reports are 
due on or before the last day of the third month following 
the close of the period covered by the report. Section 
413.24(f)(2)(ii) states that the intermediary may grant a 
30-day extension of the due date, for good cause, after 
first obtaining the approval of HCFA. Section 104.A.2 of 
the PRM requires that in order to obtain an extension, the 
provider must submit a written request and obtain written 
approval from its intermediary before the cost report due 
date. 
A provider that voluntarily or involuntarily terminates 
its participation in the Medicare program, or experiences a 
change of ownership, must file a cost report no later than 
45 days following the effective date of the termination of 
the provider agreement or the change of ownership, as 
required by  413.24(f)(2)(iii). HCFA will not grant an 
extension of the cost report due date in either of these 
situations. 
To ensure timely receipt of the cost reports, section 
2231.1 of the Intermediary Manual, Part 2, requires that the 
intermediary send a ``reminder'' letter to the provider at the 
end of the second month following the end of the cost 
reporting period. The letter advises the provider of the 
due date for filing the cost report and informs the provider 
that its interim payments will be reduced or suspended if 
the cost report is not received on or before the last day of 
the third month following the close of the period covered by 
the report. However, as allowed by  413.24(f)(2)(ii), the 
provider may, for good cause, request that the intermediary 
grant a 30-day extension of the due date of the cost report. 
If the intermediary does not receive the cost report by the 
required due date (including an extension if approved), the 
intermediary sends the first of three ``demand'' letters to 
the provider requesting the submission of the provider's 
cost report and informing the provider of the percentage by 
which its interim payment rate will be reduced. The letter 
also states that further delay in filing the cost report 
will result in an additional reduction in the interim rate 
and, ultimately, a suspension of interim payments. 
HCFA regulations at 42 CFR 405.376 set forth specific 
rules for the payment of interest on Medicare overpayments 
and underpayments. Interest is assessed unless the 
intermediary recoups the overpayment or the intermediary 
pays the provider an amount equal to the underpayment within 
30 days of a ``final determination.'' When a provider does 
not file its cost report timely, all interim payments 
advanced for the period are considered overpayments, and a 
final determination is deemed to occur on the day after the 
date the cost report was due. Interest accrues on the 
deemed overpayment until the provider files the cost report, 
after which the usual audit rules and procedures regarding 
overpayment determinations apply. 
HCFA has established a Provider Statistical and 
Reimbursement System (PS&R) to assist intermediaries in 
reconciling provider cost reports. This system provides a 
number of reports to be used in developing and auditing 
provider cost reports. HCFA prepares the reports for each 
participating provider. These reports contain Medicare 
charge and reimbursement information compiled by the 
provider's fiscal year. One of these reports, the Provider 
Summary Report, is sent to providers by their intermediaries 
in order to assist the providers in preparing their cost 
reports. The Provider Summary Report contains information 
about charges, Medicare patient days, coinsurance days, etc. 
HCFA requires the intermediaries to furnish the Provider 
Summary Report to each provider within 60 days following the 
end of the provider's fiscal year. The provider then has 30 
days to submit its completed cost report to its intermediary 
(60 days if an extension has been granted.) 
Another system that provides useful cost report data is 
the Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). This 
system is an automated data collection, data processing, and 
report generation system. HCRIS contains provider cost 
report data from all Medicare-participating hospitals, 
skilled nursing facilities, and end-stage renal disease 
facilities. HCRIS functions as the single cost report 
collection and dissemination point for Medicare cost report 
data. We use HCRIS to produce several standard files for 
the analysis of Medicare cost report data. 
For purposes of maintaining the HCRIS data base, 
Medicare intermediaries currently must submit an extract of 
provider cost report data to HCFA within either 180 days of 
the end of the hospital cost reporting period or 60 days of 
receipt of the cost report from the provider, whichever is 
later.

II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 


A. Due Dates for Filing Cost Report 


This proposed rule would increase the amount of time a 
provider has to file its cost report. Presently, under 
 413.24(f)(2)(i), a provider must file its cost report on 
or before the last day of the third month following the 
close of the period covered by the report. Under this 
proposed rule, the provider would be required to file an 
acceptable cost report, as defined at new  413.24(f)(5), on 
or before the last day of the fifth month following the 
close of the period covered by the report (that is, if a 
provider's cost reporting period ends June 30, 1994, the 
provider would have from July 1, 1994 through November 30, 
1994 to file its cost report.) For cost reporting periods 
ending on a day other than the last day of a month, cost 
reports would be due 150 days after the last day of the cost 
reporting period. (In accordance with  405.376(e)(3), 
interest would not begin to accrue until the day following 
the due date of the report.) 
In proposing this change, we are responding to 
objections from providers to the current 3-month time frame, 
which many providers believe creates an undue burden on 
their financial departments. For example, in a recent cost 
report extension survey report, many providers cited 
problems in getting accurate PS&R data as a primary reason 
for requesting an extension. Under this proposed rule, the 
additional time providers would have to submit their cost 
reports also would allow the intermediaries additional time 
to prepare the necessary PS&R reports. With the additional 
time, we believe that the intermediaries would be able to 
provide more accurate and complete PS&R data to the 
providers, which would, in turn, result in providers 
requiring less time to reconcile the PS&R data with their 
records. The providers also would have additional time to 
prepare their books and records, complete the necessary 
audits and develop financial statements and reports that are 
needed before providers can complete the cost reporting 
forms. 
We are also proposing to change the regulations at 
 413.24(f)(2)(ii) that allow an intermediary to grant, for 
good cause, a 30-day extension of the due date after first 
obtaining the approval of HCFA. Since we believe that the 
time frame we are proposing for the filing of the cost 
report (5 months) is sufficient, we propose that extensions 
may be granted by the intermediary only when a provider's 
operations are significantly adversely affected due to 
extraordinary circumstances over which the provider has no 
control. An example of such extraordinary circumstances 
might be a flood or a fire that forced a provider to cease 
operations and transfer its patients temporarily to other 
providers outside of the impacted area. The intermediary 
would still be required to obtain HCFA approval. 
We are also proposing to delete  413.24(f)(2)(iii), 
which now states that the cost report from a provider that 
voluntarily or involuntarily ceases to participate in the 
Medicare program or experiences a change of ownership is due 
no later than 45 days following the effective date of the 
termination of the provider agreement or change of 
ownership. We do not believe the current 45-day period is 
sufficient time for these providers to file a final cost 
report. Instead, as a result of the proposed deletion of 
 413.24(f)(2)(iii), providers in these cirumstances would 
be permitted the same amount of time to file a cost report 
as other providers. 


B. Acceptable Cost Report Submissions 


We are also proposing to define at  413.24(f)(5) what 
HCFA considers to be an acceptable cost report submission. 
Provisions of the proposed definition are as follows: 
 All providers: The provider must complete and 
submit the required cost reporting forms, including all 
necessary signatures, and also must submit all supporting 
documentation required by the intermediary (for example, the 
working trial balance; HCFA Form 339, Provider Cost Report 
Reimbursement Questionnaire; and copies of audited financial 
statements). 
 Providers that are required to file electronic cost 
reports: In addition to completing and submitting the 
required cost reporting forms and supporting documentation, 
the provider also must submit its cost reports in an 
electronic cost report format in conformance with the 
requirements contained in section 130 of the Electronic Cost 
Report (ECR) Specifications Manual (unless the hospital has 
received an exemption from HCFA.) These requirements 
include the electronic file passing all of the fatal 
(level 1) edits contained in the ECR Specifications Manual. 
An acceptable cost report submission also must include all 
of the appropriate signatures. (Additional instructions 
concerning electronic submission of cost reports can be 
found at  413.24(f)(4), as set forth in our final rule with 
comment period published elsewhere in this issue of the 


Federal Register

. 
In addition, we would specify that the intermediary is 
to make a determination of acceptability within 30 days of 
receipt of the cost report. If the intermediary considers 
the cost report unacceptable, the intermediary returns it to 
the provider with a letter explaining the reasons for the 
rejection (for example, the cost report failed a fatal edit 
or included incomplete documentation). When the cost report 
is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission and 
treated as if a report had never been filed. The 
intermediary would also inform the provider of the 
consequences of filing a late cost report, that is, interest 
would be assessed on all overpayments and the provider's 
interim payments would be suspended. Given the additional 
filing time, we believe providers should have sufficient 
time to complete and submit an acceptable cost report. 
Thus, we are suspending all payments if the cost report is 
not filed within the 5-month timeframe. The provider should 
make the necessary corrections to the cost report and 
resubmit the cost report to the intermediary as quickly as 
possible.

III. Related Issues 


As a result of these proposed regulation changes, the 
timing of provider reminder letters, PS&R Summary Reports 
and the submission of HCRIS data would also be affected. We 
plan to revise the Intermediary Manual and the PRM as 
necessary to reflect these changes. 


A. Reminder Letters 


Because we are proposing to lengthen the amount of time 
a provider has to file its cost report, we also would change 
the deadline for the intermediaries to send reminder letters 
to providers to notify them that cost reports are due. The 
revised deadline would be by the end of the fourth month 
after the close of the cost reporting period. The reminder 
letter may be sent at the same time an intermediary sends 
the PS&R Summary Report to the providers, but an 
intermediary may not send the reminder letter before sending 
the PS&R Summary Report. The reminder letter will inform 
the provider that if the cost report is not received by the 
end of the fifth month after the close of the cost reporting 
period, the provider's interim payments will be suspended in 
their entirety the following day, rather than just reduced 
(as the Intermediary Manual now provides). Under 
 405.371(d), if a provider does not furnish necessary 
information that is needed to determine the amounts due the 
provider under the Medicare program, interim payments may be 
suspended immediately. In addition, under  405.376(e) 
interest will be assessed immediately in the case of a cost 
report that is not filed on time. However, given the 
extended filing deadline, we believe that providers should 
have little difficulty in filing timely. 


B. PS&R Summary Report 


In conjunction with the change in the cost report due 
dates, we also intend to revise our Manual instructions to 
extend the time that HCFA allows the intermediaries to 
furnish the PS&R Summary Report to providers. 
Intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&R Summary 
Report by the last day of the fourth month following the end 
of the provider's cost reporting period, instead of 60 days 
following the end of the provider's cost reporting period, 
as is currently the practice. For cost reporting periods 
ending on a day other than the last day of a month, 
intermediaries would be required to furnish the PS&R Summary 
Report by the 120th day following the end of a provider's 
cost reporting period. As noted above, an intermediary must 
send the PS&R Summary Report to a provider before or at the 
same time as it sends the reminder letter. (The reminder 
letter cannot be sent before the PS&R Summary Report.) This 
change would ensure that a provider still would have at 
least 30 days after receipt of the PS&R Summary Report to 
complete and submit the cost report to the intermediary. If 
the provider receives the PS&R Summary Report later than the 
last day of the fourth month (or the 120th day, if 
applicable) following the end of its cost reporting period, 
the provider would have 30 days from receipt to file its 
cost report. 


C. HCRIS Data 


Presently, the intermediary must submit HCRIS data to 
HCFA within either 180 days of the end of the hospital cost 
reporting period or 60 days of receipt of the cost report 
from the provider, whichever is later. The current 180-day 
deadline is based on the following: (1) 90 days for a 
provider to file its cost report, (2) 30 days for an 
extension of time to file (available to providers with good 
cause), and (3) an additional 60 days for the intermediary 
to submit HCRIS data to HCFA. In conjunction with the 
proposed extension of the deadline for filing a cost report, 
we would revise the Intermediary Manual to instruct 
intermediaries to submit HCRIS data to HCFA within 210 days 
of the last day of the hospital cost reporting period. The 
new deadline is based on the following: (1) 150 days for 
filing a cost report and (2) 60 days for submission of HCRIS 
data to HCFA. The 30-day extension of time to file a cost 
report would be eliminated. As explained above, extensions 
would be granted only under extraordinary circumstances, and 
therefore an additional 30 days for a filing extension 
normally would not be necessary. 
In addition, we plan to revise our Manual instructions 
to specify that if the intermediary is late in sending the 
PS&R Summary Report to the providers, the amount of time for 
the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced 
by the same number of days the PS&R Summary Report was late. 
For example, if the intermediary sends the PS&R Summary 
Report to the provider 10 days late, the provider would 
still have 30 days from receipt of the PS&R Summary Report 
to file its cost report. However, the time remaining for 
the intermediary to submit the HCRIS data would be reduced 
by a corresponding 10 days (that is, from 60 to 50 days 
following receipt of the cost report.) In such cases, the 
intermediary still would have a total of 210 days from the 
end of the hospital cost reporting period to submit HCRIS 
data to HCFA. 
As explained above, the overall effect of the 
extension of the time frame for providers to file cost 
reports would be that HCFA would not have access to updated 
HCRIS data until 210 days after the end of a given cost 
reporting period. This change would not delay significantly 
the availability of the analytical files (which are updated 
quarterly) in HCRIS, and it should improve the accuracy of 
initial cost report data. Although it would delay the 
availability in the analytical files of cost report data for 
the most recent cost reporting period, it would not affect 
availability of a complete set of cost report data. 
Under the current requirements for intermediaries to 
transmit cost report data extracts, a complete set of cost 
report data for any Federal fiscal year is not available 
until 180 days after the latest cost reporting period in the 
Federal fiscal year. For example, if a provider's cost 
reporting period begins on September 1, 1993 and ends on 
August 31, 1994, its cost report extract now would be due to 
HCFA by February 27, 1995 (180 days after the end of the 
cost reporting period). The data would be available for use 
in the next quarterly update of the analytical files, which 
would take place on March 31, 1995. In this case, under the 
proposed provisions, we would extend the due date for HCRIS 
submissions from 180 days after the hospital cost reporting 
period ends to within 210 days of the last day of the 
hospital's cost reporting period. Thus, in the above 
example, the cost report extract of a provider with a cost 
reporting period ending August 31, 1994, would be due to 
HCFA by March 29, 1995. The data from this provider's file 
still would be available for use in the March 31, 1995 
update of the analytical files.

IV. Impact Statement 


We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis 
that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies 
that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. This 
proposed rule would extend from 3 months to 5 months the 
time frame that providers have to file their cost reports 
and would define what HCFA considers to be an ``acceptable'' 
cost report submission. Neither of these proposed changes 
would have a significant economic impact on providers. 
Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, 
that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect 
on a substantial number of small entities. Thus, we are not 
preparing a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to 
prepare a regulatory impact statement if a proposed rule may 
have a significant economic impact on the operations of a 
substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an 
analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of 
the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we 
define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located 
outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer 
than 50 beds. 
We are not preparing a regulatory impact statement 
since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that 
this proposed rule would not have a significant economic 
impact on the operations of a substantial number of small 
rural hospitals. 
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 
12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget. 


V. Other Required Information 


A. Public Comment 


Because of the large number of pieces of correspondence 
we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to 
acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in 
preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments that 
we receive by the date specified in the 

Dates

 section of 
this preamble, and we will respond to the comments in the 
preamble of that rule. 


B. Paperwork Reduction Act 


This document does not impose information collection 
and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not 
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the 
authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980

required in paragraphs (f)(4) and (f)(5)(i) of this section, 
the provider must submit its cost reports in an electronic 
cost report format in conformance with the requirements 
contained in the Electronic Cost Report (ECR) Specifications 
Manual (unless the provider has received an exemption from

(iii) The intermediary makes a determination of 
acceptability within 30 days of receipt of the provider's

report is rejected, it is deemed an unacceptable submission 
and treated as if a report had never been filed.

ACTION: 

Proposed rule; extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On April 7, 1994; (59 FR 16592), the Federal Maritime Commission published a proposed rule to, 

inter alia,

 amend its regulations governing financial reporting requirements and rate of return methodology applicable to
vessel-operating common carriers by water in the domestic offshore trades to discontinue use of the comparable earnings
test in determining the reasonableness of a carrier's return on rate base. In its place, the Commission proposes to
use the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Matson Navigation Company requests an extension of the comment
period. Its request is granted.

Single State Insurance Registration [Petition of Lee's Permit Service, et al.] 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Interstate Commerce Commission. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is proposing to revise its regulations pertaining to registration by motor carriers with States.
The Commission has learned that delays inherent in the registration process are diminishing or negating the usefulness
of emergency temporary and temporary motor carrier operating authorities. The proposed regulations provide expedited
registration procedures for carriers operating under such temporary authorities and establish concomitant enforcement
mechanisms for the participating States. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In response to a petition jointly filed by motor carrier consulting companies Lee's Permit Service and Little Debby's
Tag Service (petitioners), the Commission is proposing to amend the Single State Registration System (SSRS) rules
it promulgated in Single State Insurance Registration, 9 I.C.C.2d 610 (1993). Petitioners have found that some States
participating in the SSRS take 2 to 3 weeks to process applications. Under the SSRS rules, carriers may not operate
lawfully in participating States without carrying copies of registration receipts in their vehicles. Petitioners
argue that the delay diminishes the usefulness of their temporary authorites. To address the situation, the Commission
is proposing regulations providing expedited registration procedures for carriers operating under temporary
authorities. 



The Commission invites interested parties to submit comments on the proposed rules. In addition, parties may address
the necessity and feasibility of modifying the current registration application form, appearing as appendix A to
49 CFR part 1023, in lieu of or in addition to adopting new rules. In this connection, parties may address the feasibility
of a carrier's maintaining in its vehicles a copy of a filed application and/or a filed notice. The Commission encourages
parties that are in agreement to submit joint filings. Parties adopting by reference the comments submitted by others
need not submit copies of the referenced material. 

Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to,
call, or pick up in person from: Office of the Secretary, room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington,
DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 927-7428. (Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD service
(202) 927-5721.) 



Initial Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we preliminarily conclude that our proposed action in this proceeding will not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of our action is to enable motor
carriers that gain temporary operating authorities to be able immediately to use their authorities without fear
of incurring State fines. Compliance by carriers with a simple, expedited filing and copying requirement would result
in relief from the threat of State regulatory enforcement. The economic impact on small entities, if any, should be
positive but is not likely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. We invite parties
to comment on the issue of economic impact on small entities in order to assist us in making findings in this area.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking and advance notice of proposed rulemaking.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FDIC, FRB, OCC, and OTS (the Agencies) are proposing revisions to their risk-based capital standards to address
the regulatory capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that expose banks, bank
holding companies, and thrifts to credit risk. The proposal is intended to correct certain inconsistencies in the
Agencies' risk-based capital standards and allow banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations) to maintain
lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse transactions. The proposal would require higher amounts of
risk-based capital to be maintained against certain direct credit substitutes, including, for banking organizations,
purchased servicing rights that provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced and purchased subordinated
interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets, and, for both banking organizations
and thrifts, certain guarantee-type arrangements (such as standby letters of credit) provided for third-party
assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets.


The OTS is proposing to change only the capital requirements for the treatment of guarantee-type arrangements that
absorb first dollar losses. In all other respects, the OTS treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes would
continue to follow existing OTS capital regulations. The OTS regulations have been revised for clarity and now include
language codifying agency regulatory guidance.
In addition, the Agencies are publishing, in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), a preliminary proposal
to use credit ratings to match the risk-based capital assessment more closely to an institution's relative risk of
loss in certain asset securitizations. The Agencies are also requesting comment in the ANPR on the need for a similar
system for unrated asset securitizations and on how such a system could be designed.
The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and ANPR that
result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply only to transactions
that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules.

I. Introduction and Background


A. Overview


Each of the Agencies is proposing to amend its risk-based capital standards to clarify and revise the treatment of
recourse arrangements and certain direct credit substitutes that expose banking organizations (banks and bank
holding companies) and thrifts to credit risk. The Banking Agencies (OCC, FRB, and FDIC) are also proposing to recommend
that the FFIEC make conforming revisions to the regulatory reporting requirements applicable to asset transfers
with recourse and direct credit substitutes for insured commercial banks and FDIC-supervised savings banks.
This notice of proposed rulemaking would amend the Agencies' risk-based capital standards to:
 Define the term ``recourse'' and expand the definition of the term ``direct credit substitute'';

1






 Create an exception to the Banking Agencies' current guidelines that would reduce the amount of capital required
for certain low-level recourse transactions;

2






 Require banking organizations that purchase loan servicing rights that provide loss protection to the owners
of the loans serviced to hold capital against those loans;
 Require banking organizations that purchase subordinated interests in loans or pools of loans that absorb
the first dollars of losses from those loans to hold capital against the subordinated interest plus all more senior
interests; and
 Require banking organizations and thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-type
arrangements for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets to hold the same amount
of capital that they would be required to hold under a recourse arrangement with equivalent risk exposure.
The Agencies are also publishing as an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) a preliminary ``multi-level
approach,'' that would use credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations to measure
relative exposure to risk in rated securitized asset transactions and would allow the capital assessment to vary
with the risk. The Agencies are also requesting comment in the ANPR on the need for a separate multi-level approach
for unrated securitizations and on how such a system could be designed.


B. Purpose and Effect


Implementation of all aspects of this proposal, including one or more multi-level approaches for securitization
transactions, would result in more consistent treatments of recourse and similar transactions among the Agencies,
more consistent risk-based capital treatments for transactions involving similar risk, and capital requirements
that more closely reflect a banking organization or thrift's relative exposure to credit risk. In particular, the
proposed treatments of low-level recourse transactions, purchased loan servicing rights that provide loss protection,
and purchased subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets would bring
the capital requirements of the Banking Agencies into greater conformity with those of the OTS.
The proposal would allow banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations) to maintain lower amounts of capital
against low-level recourse transactions. The proposal would also require higher amounts of risk-based capital
to be maintained against certain direct credit substitutes, including, for banking organizations, purchased servicing
rights that provide loss protection to the owners of the loans serviced and purchased subordinated interests that
absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets, and, for both banking organizations and thrifts, certain
guarantee-type arrangements provided for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those
assets.
Additionally, the Agencies expect that a multi-level approach will provide a method for identifying participants
in securitization transactions that are relatively insulated from credit risk and therefore eligible for reduced
capital assessments.
The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and advance
notice of proposed rulemaking that result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations
or thrifts would apply only to transactions that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules. The
Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice that result in reduced risk-based capital
requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply to all transactions outstanding as of the effective
date of such final rules and to all subsequent transactions.
The Agencies believe that the proposed rule would satisfy the requirements of section 618(b)(3) of the Resolution
Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act, since the proposed rule would apply to multifamily
residential property loans sold with recourse.


C. Background


1. Recourse and Direct Credit Substitutes


Asset securitization is the process by which loans and other receivables are pooled, reconstituted into one or more
classes or positions, and then sold. Securitizations typically carve up the risk of credit losses from the underlying
assets and distribute it to different parties. The ``first dollar'' loss or subordinate position is first to absorb
credit losses, the ``senior'' investor position is last, and there may be one or more loss positions in between (``second
dollar'' loss positions). Each loss position functions as a credit enhancement for the more senior loss positions
in the structure.
For residential mortgages that are sold through the federally sponsored mortgage programs, a federal government
agency or federally sponsored agency guarantees the securities sold to investors. However, many of today's asset
securitization programs involve nonmortgage assets and are not supported in any way by the federal government. Sellers
of these privately securitized assets therefore provide other forms of credit enhancement_first and second dollar
loss positions_to reduce investors' risk of loss.
Sellers may provide this credit enhancement themselves through recourse arrangements. For purposes of this notice,
``recourse'' refers to any risk of loss that an institution may retain in connection with the transfer of its assets.
While banking organizations and thrifts have long provided recourse in connection with sales of whole loans or loan
participations, recourse arrangements today are frequently associated with asset securitization programs.
Sellers may also arrange for a third party to provide credit enhancement in an asset securitization. If the third-party
enhancement is provided by another banking organization or thrift, that institution assumes some portion of the
assets' credit risk. For purposes of this proposal, all forms of third-party enhancements, 

i.e., 

all arrangements in which an institution assumes risk of loss from third-party assets or other claims that it has not
transferred, are referred to as ``direct credit substitutes.''

3

 In economic terms, an institution's risk of loss from providing a direct credit substitute can be identical to its
risk of loss from transferring an asset with recourse.




Depending upon the type of asset securitization, a portion of the total credit enhancement may also be provided internally,
as part of the securitization structure, through the use of spread accounts, overcollateralization, or other forms
of self-enhancement. Many asset securitizations use a combination of internal enhancement, recourse, and third-party
enhancement to protect investors from risk of loss.


2. Prior History


On June 29, 1990, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) published a request for comment
on recourse arrangements. See 55 FR 26766 (June 29, 1990). The publication announced the Agencies' intent to review
the regulatory capital, reporting and lending limit treatments of assets transferred with recourse and similar
transactions, and set out a broad range of issues for public comment. The FFIEC received approximately 150 comment
letters in response. The FFIEC then narrowed the scope of the review to the reporting and capital treatments of recourse
arrangements and direct credit substitutes that expose banking organizations and thrifts to credit-related risks.

In July 1992, after receiving preliminary recommendations from an interagency staff working group, the FFIEC directed
the staff to carry out a study of the likely impact of those recommendations on banking organizations and thrifts,
financial markets and other affected parties. As part of that study, the staff held a series of meetings with representatives
from thirteen organizations active in the securitization and credit enhancement markets. Summaries of the information
provided to the staff and a copy of the staff's letter sent to participants prior to the meetings are in the FFIEC's public
file on recourse arrangements and are available for public inspection and photocopying. Additional material provided
to the Agencies from financial institutions and others since these meetings has also been placed in the FFIEC's public
file. 

The FFIEC's offices are located at 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., suite 200, Washington, DC 20037. For public convenience,
the Agencies have also placed copies of all of the above material in the FRB's public file, located at 20th Street and
Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20551, room B-1122. 



D. Current Risk-Based Capital Treatments of Recourse and Direct Credit Substitutes 



Currently, the Agencies' risk-based capital standards apply different treatments to recourse arrangements and
direct credit substitutes. As a result, capital requirements applicable to credit enhancements do not consistently
reflect credit risk. The Banking Agencies' current rules are also not consistent with those of the OTS. 



1. Recourse 



a. 

Banking agencies.

 The Banking Agencies' risk-based capital guidelines prescribe a single treatment for assets transferred with recourse
whether the transaction is reported as a financing or a sale of assets in a bank's Consolidated Reports of Condition
and Income (Call Report). In either case, risk-based capital is held against the full, risk-weighted amount of the
transferred assets, regardless of the amount of recourse that is provided.

4

 





Assets transferred with any amount of recourse in transactions reported as financings remain on the balance sheet
and continue to be subject to the full risk-based capital charge (based on their risk-weight). 

Assets transferred with recourse in transactions that are reported as sales create off-balance sheet exposures.
The entire outstanding amount of the assets sold (not just the amount of the recourse) is converted into an on-balance
sheet credit equivalent amount using a 100% credit conversion factor. 

This capital treatment differs from the accounting treatment for recourse arrangements under generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) and is intended to ensure that banking organizations that transfer assets and retain
the credit risk inherent in the assets maintain adequate capital to support that risk. As is explained below, the Banking
Agencies believe that the GAAP accounting treatment would not provide sufficient capital to support recourse arrangements.


b. 

OTS

. OTS follows GAAP in according sales treatment to sales with recourse for reporting purposes and for calculating
the leverage ratios of thrifts. Under the OTS risk-based capital regulation, thrifts must also hold capital against
the full value of assets transferred with recourse in computing their risk-based capital requirements, unless the
capital charge would exceed the contractual maximum amount of the recourse provided. If the capital charge would
exceed the amount of the recourse, then the thrift is only required to hold dollar-for-dollar capital against the
contractual maximum amount of the recourse (the low-level recourse rule). (Footnote 17 below addresses the treatment
of recourse liability accounts.) 



2. Direct Credit Substitutes 



a. 

Banking agencies.

 Direct credit substitutes are treated differently from recourse under the current risk-based capital standards.
Under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, off-balance sheet direct credit substitutes, such as financial standby
letters of credit provided for third-party assets, carry a 100% credit conversion factor. However, only the dollar
amount of the direct credit substitute is converted into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent so that capital is
held only against the face amount of the direct credit substitute. The capital requirement for a recourse arrangement,
in contrast, is based on the full amount of the assets enhanced. 

If a direct credit substitute covers less than 100% of the losses on the assets enhanced, the current capital treatment
results in a lower capital charge for a direct credit substitute than for a comparable recourse arrangement. For example,
if a direct credit substitute covers losses up to 20% of the amount of the assets enhanced, then the on-balance sheet
credit equivalent amount equals that 20% amount. Risk-based capital is held against only the 20% amount. In contrast,
required capital for a 20% recourse arrangement is higher because capital is held against the full outstanding amount
of the assets enhanced.

5

 





Under the Agencies' proposal, the definition of direct credit substitute would also be expanded to include some items
that are already partially reflected on the balance sheet, such as purchased subordinated interests. Currently,
under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, these interests receive the same capital treatment as off-balance sheet
direct credit substitutes. Purchased subordinated interests are placed in the appropriate risk-weight category
and then added to the banking organization's risk-weighted assets. In contrast, if a banking organization retains
a subordinated interest in connection with the transfer of its own assets, this is considered recourse. The institution
must hold capital against the carrying amount of the subordinated interest as well as the outstanding amount of all
senior interests that it supports. 

b. 

OTS.

 The OTS risk-based capital regulation treats some forms of direct credit substitutes (

e.g.

, financial standby letters of credit) the same as the Banking Agencies' guidelines. However, unlike the Banking
Agencies, the OTS treats purchased subordinated interests under its general recourse provisions (except for certain
high quality subordinated mortgage-related securities). The risk-based capital requirement is based on the carrying
amount of the subordinated interest plus all senior interests, as though the thrift owned the full outstanding amount
of the assets enhanced. 



3. Problems With Existing Risk-Based Capital Treatments of Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes



The Agencies are proposing changes to the risk-based capital standards to address the following major concerns with
the current treatments of recourse and direct credit substitutes: 

 Different amounts of capital can be required for recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that
expose a banking organization or thrift to equivalent risk of loss. 

 The standards generally do not reduce the capital requirement for banking organizations that reduce their
risk by transferring assets with low levels of recourse. 

 The capital assessment rate does not recognize the difference in risk of loss between recourse or direct credit
substitutes that absorb first losses and recourse or direct credit substitutes that absorb second losses from the
underlying assets. 

 The current standards do not provide uniform definitions of recourse, direct credit substitute, and associated
terms. 



E. GAAP Treatment of Recourse Arrangements

<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00015 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

As was mentioned above, the Banking Agencies' regulatory capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse differs
from the accounting treatment of asset transfers with recourse under generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP).

6

 The Banking Agencies do not believe it would be appropriate to conform the regulatory capital treatment of recourse
arrangements to GAAP. 





Under GAAP, a transfer of receivables with recourse is accounted for as a sale if the transferor (1) surrenders control
of the future economic benefits of the assets, (2) is able to reasonably estimate its obligations under the recourse
provision, and (3) is not obligated to repurchase the assets except pursuant to the recourse provision. These provisions
indicate that GAAP focuses on the transfer of benefits rather than the retention of risk in determining whether an
asset transfer should be accounted for as a sale. 

The transferor must accrue, as a separate liability, an amount sufficient to absorb all estimated probable losses
under the recourse provision over the life of the assets transferred. This accrued amount is referred to as the GAAP
recourse liability. If a banking organization reported assets transferred with recourse in accordance with GAAP,
and no regulatory capital were required for the transaction, then the institution's only protection against losses
would be the GAAP recourse liability account. For a number of reasons, the Banking Agencies are of the opinion that
the GAAP recourse liability account would be an inadequate substitute for an appropriate level of regulatory capital.


First, the GAAP recourse liability account is intended to cover only an institution's probable expected losses under
the recourse provision. In contrast, regulatory capital is intended to provide a cushion against unexpected losses.
In recognition of the distinctly different purposes of the GAAP recourse liability account and regulatory capital,
the Banking Agencies explicitly exclude the GAAP recourse liability account from regulatory capital. 

Second, the amount of credit risk that is typically retained in a recourse transaction greatly exceeds the normal,
expected losses associated with the transferred assets. Even though a transferor may reduce its exposure to potential
catastrophic losses by limiting the amount of recourse it provides, in many cases the transferor still retains the
bulk of the risk inherent in the assets. 

For example, if an institution transfers high quality assets with 10% recourse that have a reasonably estimated loss
rate of 1%, the transferor retains the risk of default up to a maximum of 10% of the total amount of the assets transferred.
Because the recourse provision represents exposure to such a high amount of losses relative to the expected losses,
in the normal course of business the transferor will sustain the same amount of losses as if the assets had not been sold.
Consequently, the Banking Agencies take the position that the transferor in this example has not significantly reduced
its risk for purposes of assessing regulatory capital and should continue to be assessed regulatory capital as though
the assets have not been transferred. 

Third, the GAAP reliance on reasonable estimates of all probable credit losses over the life of the receivables transferred
poses additional concerns for the Banking Agencies. While it may be possible to make such estimates for pools of consumer
loans or residential mortgages, the Banking Agencies are of the view that it is difficult to do so for other types of
loans. Even if it is possible to make a reasonable estimate of probable credit losses at the time an asset or asset pool
is transferred, the ability of an institution to make a reasonable estimate may change over the life of the transferred
assets. 

Finally, the Banking Agencies are concerned that an institution transferring assets with recourse might estimate
that it would not have any losses under the recourse provision, in which case it would not establish any GAAP recourse
liability account for the exposure. If the transferor recorded either no liability or only a nominal liability in
the GAAP recourse liability account for a succession of asset transfers, a cumulation of credit risk would occur that
would not be reflected, or would be only partially reflected, on the balance sheet. 



II. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



The Agencies' proposal to amend the risk-based capital standards would do the following: 

 Define the term ``recourse,'' expand the definition of the existing term ``direct credit substitute,'' and
define the associated terms ``standard representations and warranties'' and ``servicer cash advance''; 

 Reduce the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital assessment for certain low-level recourse arrangements;
and 

 Require equivalent treatment of recourse arrangements and certain direct credit substitutes that present
equivalent risk of loss, including 




_requiring banking organizations that purchase certain loan servicing rights which provide loss protection to
the owners of the loans serviced to hold capital against those loans, 

_requiring banking organizations that purchase subordinated interests which absorb the first dollars of losses
from the underlying assets to hold capital against the subordinated interest plus all more senior interests, and


_requiring banking organizations and thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-like
arrangements for third-party assets that absorb the first dollars of losses from those assets to hold capital against
the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced.

A. Definitions of Recourse and Direct Credit Substitute 



1. Recourse 



The proposal defines ``recourse'' to mean any risk of loss that a banking organization or thrift 

retains

 in connection with an asset transfer, if the risk of loss exceeds a pro rata share of the institution's claim on the assets.

8

 The proposed definition of recourse is consistent with the Banking Agencies' longstanding use of this term, and is
intended to incorporate into the risk-based capital standards existing Agency practices regarding retention of
risk in asset transfers.

<TEXT>
 

Currently, the term ``recourse'' is not explicitly defined in the Banking Agencies' risk-based capital guidelines.
Instead, the guidelines use the term ``sale of assets with recourse,'' which is defined by reference to the Call Report
instructions. See Call Report instructions, Glossary (entry for ``Sales of Assets''). Once a definition of recourse
is adopted in the risk-based capital guidelines, the Banking Agencies would delete the cross-reference to the Call
Report instructions and would recommend to the FFIEC that these instructions be revised to incorporate the risk-based
capital definition of recourse. The OTS capital regulation currently provides a definition of the term ``recourse,''
which would also be replaced once a final definition of recourse is adopted. 



2. Direct Credit Substitute 


The proposed definition of ``direct credit substitute'' is intended to mirror the definition of recourse. The term
``direct credit substitute'' would refer to any arrangement in which an institution 

assumes 

risk of loss from assets or other claims it has not transferred, if the risk of loss exceeds the institution's pro rata
share of the assets or other claims. Currently, under the Banking Agencies' guidelines, this term covers guarantees
and guarantee-type arrangements. As revised, it would also explicitly include items such as purchased subordinated
interests and agreements to cover credit losses that arise from purchased loan servicing rights. 



3. Risks Other Than Credit Risks 


These definitions cover arrangements that create exposure to all types of risk. However, a capital charge would be
assessed only against arrangements that create exposure to credit or credit-related risks. This continues the Agencies'
current practice and is consistent with the risk-based capital standards' current, primary focus on credit risk.




4. Implicit Recourse 



The definitions cover all arrangements that are recourse or direct credit substitutes, in form or in substance. This
continues the Banking Agencies' current treatment of recourse under the Call Report instructions.

10

 Recourse exists in substance, or implicitly, when an institution demonstrates a pattern of providing recourse even
though it has no legal obligation to do so. For example, an institution that regularly buys back or replaces problem
assets when it is not required to do so under the terms of the sale agreement may be providing recourse. The Agencies
will continue their current practice of requiring institutions that demonstrate a pattern of providing implicit
recourse to treat those transactions and all similar outstanding transactions as recourse for risk-based capital
purposes. The Agencies will follow the same approach, as appropriate, for direct credit substitutes. Decisions
concerning implicit recourse or implicit direct credit substitute arrangements will be made on a case-by-case basis.






5. Subordinated Interests in Loans or Pools of Loans 


The definitions explicitly cover an institution's ownership of subordinated interests in loans or pools of loans.
This continues the Banking Agencies' longstanding treatment of retained subordinated interests as recourse and
recognizes that purchased subordinated interests can also function as credit enhancements. Subordinated interests
generally absorb more than their pro rata share of losses (principal or interest) from the underlying assets in the
event of default.

11

 For example, a multi-class asset securitization may have several classes of subordinated securities, each of which
provides credit enhancement for the more senior classes. Generally, the holder of any class that absorbs more than
its pro rata share of losses from the total underlying assets is providing recourse or a direct credit substitute for
all more senior classes.

12

 





6. Second Mortgages 



Second mortgages or home equity loans would generally not be considered recourse or direct credit substitutes, unless
they actually functioned as credit enhancements by facilitating the sale of the first mortgage. This is most likely
to occur if a lender originates first and second mortgages contemporaneously on the same property and then sells the
first mortgage and retains the second. In such a transaction, the second mortgage would function as a substitute for
a recourse arrangement because it is intended that the second mortgage will absorb losses before the first mortgage
does if the borrower fails to make all payments due on both loans. Under the proposal, a second mortgage that is originated
at or about the same time as the first mortgage would be presumed to be a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute
unless the holder was able to demonstrate that the second mortgage was granted for some purpose other than providing
credit enhancement for the first mortgage (e.g., home improvement loans). 



(Question 1) 

The Agencies specifically request comment on this proposed treatment and on whether additional factors should be
considered in determining whether a second mortgage provides recourse or a direct credit substitute. 



7. Representations and Warranties 


When a banking organization or thrift transfers assets, including servicing rights, it customarily makes representations
and warranties concerning those assets. When a banking organization or thrift purchases loan servicing rights,
it may also assume representations and warranties made by the seller or a prior servicer. These representations and
warranties give certain rights to other parties and impose obligations upon the seller or servicer of the assets.
The definitions would treat as recourse or direct credit substitutes any representations or warranties that create
exposure to default risk or any other form of open-ended, credit-related risk from the assets that is not controllable
by the seller or servicer. This reflects the Agencies' current practice with respect to recourse arising out of representations
and warranties, and explicitly recognizes that a servicer with purchased loan servicing rights can also take on risk
through servicer representations and warranties. 
The Agencies recognize, however, that the market requires asset transferors and servicers to make certain representations
and warranties, and that most of these present only normal, operational risk. Currently, the Agencies have no formal
standard for distinguishing between these types of representations and warranties and those that create recourse
or direct credit substitutes. The proposal therefore defines the term ``standard representations and warranties''
and provides that seller or servicer representations or warranties that meet this definition would not be considered
recourse or direct credit substitutes. 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposal, ``standard representations and warranties'' are those that refer to an existing state of facts
that the seller or servicer can either control or verify with reasonable due diligence at the time the assets are sold
or the servicing rights are transferred. These representations and warranties will not be considered recourse or
direct credit substitutes, provided that the seller or servicer performs due diligence prior to the transfer of the
assets or servicing rights to ensure that it has a reasonable basis for making the representation or warranty. The
term ``standard representations and warranties'' would also cover contractual provisions that permit the return
of transferred assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies, (i.e., if the assets are not what the seller
represented them to be), consistent with the current Call Report instructions governing the reporting of asset transfers.
After a final definition of ``standard representations and warranties'' is adopted for the risk-based capital standards,
the Banking Agencies would recommend to the FFIEC that the Call Report instructions be changed to conform to the capital
guidelines and the OTS would similarly amend the instructions for the Thrift Financial Report (TFR). 

Examples of ``standard representations and warranties'' include seller representations that the transferred
assets are current (i.e., not past due) at the time of sale; that the assets meet specific, agreed-upon credit standards
at the time of sale; or that the assets are free and clear of any liens (provided that the seller has exercised due diligence
to verify these facts). An example of a nonstandard representation and warranty would be a contractual provision
stating that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages are free of environmental hazards. This representation
is not verifiable by the seller or servicer with reasonable due diligence because it is not possible to absolutely
verify that a property is, in fact, free of all environmental hazards. Such an open-ended guarantee against the risk
that unknown but currently existing hazards might be discovered in the future would be considered recourse or a direct
credit substitute. However, a seller's representation that all properties underlying a pool of transferred mortgages
have undergone environmental studies and that the studies revealed no known environmental hazards would be a ``standard
representation and warranty'' (assuming that the seller performed the requisite due diligence). This is a verifiable
statement of facts that would not be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute.



8. Loan Servicing Arrangements 



The definitions cover loan servicing arrangements if the servicer is responsible for credit losses associated with
the loans being serviced. However, cash advances made by servicers to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to
investors or the timely collection of the loans would be specifically excluded from the definitions of recourse and
direct credit substitute, provided that the servicer is entitled to reimbursement for any significant advances.

13

 Such advances are assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the cash advance, and are assigned to the
risk-weight category appropriate to the party that is obligated to reimburse the servicer. 





If the servicer is not entitled to full reimbursement, then the maximum possible amount of any nonreimbursed advances
on any one loan must be contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan
in order for the cash advance to be excluded from the definitions of recourse and direct credit substitute. This treatment
reflects the Agencies' traditional view that servicer cash advances meeting these criteria are part of the normal
servicing function and do not constitute credit enhancements. 



B. Low-level recourse rule 



The Banking Agencies are proposing to reduce the capital requirement for all recourse transactions in which a banking
organization contractually limits its exposure to less than the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the assets transferred (referred to as ``low-level recourse transactions'').

14

 This proposal would apply to low-level recourse transactions involving all types of assets, including small business
loans, commercial loans and residential mortgages. 





1. ``Dollar-for-dollar'' Capital Requirement Up to the Amount of the Recourse Obligation for Low-Level Recourse




Under the proposed low-level recourse rule, a banking organization that contractually limits its maximum recourse
obligation to less than the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the transferred assets would be required
to hold risk-based capital equal to the contractual maximum amount of its recourse obligation. This would be a ``dollar-for-dollar''
capital requirement for the low-level recourse exposure. For example, the risk-based capital requirement for a
100% risk-weighted asset transferred with 3% recourse would be only 3% of the value of the transferred assets rather
than the currently required 8%. This would prevent a banking organization's capital requirement from exceeding
the contractual maximum amount that it could lose under a recourse obligation.

15

 In addition, adoption of this proposal would bring the Banking Agencies into conformity with the OTS, which already
applies the low-level recourse rule to thrifts. 





The Agencies will continue to evaluate the need for full capital support for low-level recourse transactions and
will consider, in connection with development of the multi-level approaches that are discussed in Section III, whether
even greater reductions in the capital requirement for low-level recourse transactions should be proposed. 



2. Low-level Recourse Arrangements for Mortgage-Related Securities or Participation Certificates Retained in
a Mortgage Loan Swap 



When an institution swaps mortgage loans for mortgage-related securities or participation certificates and retains
low-level recourse, the Banking Agencies currently base the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if the
loans were held as on-balance sheet assets. The OTS bases the capital requirement for these arrangements on its existing
low-level recourse rule, with a minimum capital level of 1.6% of the mortgage-related securities or participation
certificates. (These certificates would include only high-quality mortgage related securities.) 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To recognize the risks related to such a participation certificate and the retained recourse, the Agencies propose
to change their capital requirement for this arrangement. The requirement would equal the sum of the amount of risk-based
capital required for the portion of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate not covered by the
institution's recourse obligation and the risk-based capital required for the low-level recourse obligation retained
on the underlying loans, limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans as if the loans were held as on-balance
sheet assets. 
For example, if an institution swaps $1,000 of qualifying single-family mortgage loans for a Freddie Mac participation
certificate and retains 1% recourse, the proposed capital requirement would equal the sum of the following: 


(1) $1,000 times (100% minus 1%)

16

 times 20% risk-weight times 8% = $15.84, and 




(2) $1,000 times 1% = $10 



This sum, $25.84, is limited by the capital requirement on the underlying loans as if they were held by the institution.
This limit is 4% of $1,000 or $40. Thus, since the sum, $25.84, is less than the limit, $40, the capital requirement is
$25.84. 


3. Reporting of Low-Level Recourse Transactions 


The Banking Agencies are also proposing to recommend to the FFIEC that banks be permitted to report low-level recourse
transactions as sales of assets (rather than financings) in the Call Report, if they establish and maintain a recourse
liability account for the contractual maximum amount of the recourse obligation. (Otherwise, these transactions
would continue to be reported as financings in the Call Report.) The recourse liability account could be established
either by a charge to expense or to the allowance for loan and lease losses, as appropriate. The recourse liability
account would not be part of the allowance for loan and lease losses and would therefore be excluded from the bank's
capital base. Banks that fully reserve against their recourse exposure in this manner would not be assessed any risk-based
capital for the transaction, which would be consistent with the current treatment of such transactions for thrifts.
The accounting entries which permit the removal of the assets from a bank's balance sheet on the condition that the
low-level risk exposures are either expensed or fully reserved for (either of which produces a change in the bank's
equity capital position) result in an appropriately adjusted leverage capital ratio. 
The Banking Agencies currently permit banks to report as sales in the Call Report certain residential and agricultural
mortgage transfers with recourse that qualify as sales under GAAP. The FRB requires bank holding companies to report
all asset sales with recourse in accordance with GAAP on the consolidated financial statement for bank holding companies
(Form FR Y-9C). The OTS requires thrifts to report all transfers of receivables with recourse in accordance
with GAAP on their TFRs. The Agencies are not proposing to change these existing regulatory reporting treatments.



4. GAAP Recourse Liability Account 


As previously explained, under GAAP, when a transfer of receivables with recourse qualifies to be recognized as a
sale, the seller must establish a recourse liability account at the date of sale that covers all probable credit losses
under the recourse provision over the life of the receivables transferred. 


(Question 2)

 The Banking Agencies request comment on how the GAAP recourse liability account should be treated under the proposed
low-level recourse rule for transfers of receivables with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call
Report and FR Y-9C.

17

 That is, when a banking organization transfers assets in such transactions, should the amount of capital required
under the low-level recourse rule be adjusted to take account of the institution's GAAP recourse liability account?





The two options are: (1) Not taking the GAAP recourse liability account into consideration at all; or (2) requiring
risk-based capital equal to the amount of the banking organization's low-level recourse obligation minus the balance
of its GAAP recourse liability account so that the recourse liability account plus required capital would equal the
banking organization's contractual maximum exposure under the recourse obligation.

18

 The latter option would conform the Banking Agencies' treatment to that of the OTS in this area. 




The Banking Agencies' existing risk-based capital guidelines also do not indicate how the GAAP recourse liability
account should be taken into account in general when determining the credit equivalent amounts of assets transferred
with recourse that are currently reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y-9C. The Banking Agencies expect
to apply the GAAP recourse liability account treatment that they adopt for low-level recourse transactions that
are reported as sales in the Call Report or FR Y-9C to all asset transfers with recourse that are currently reported
as sales in the Call Report or FR Y-9C, and to clarify their risk-based capital guidelines accordingly. 


C. Treatment of Direct Credit Substitutes 


The Agencies are proposing to extend the current risk-based capital treatment of asset transfers with recourse (including
the proposed low-level recourse rule) to certain direct credit substitutes. As previously explained, the current
risk-based capital assessment for a direct credit substitute may be dramatically lower than the assessment for a
recourse provision that creates an identical exposure to risk. Based on the Agencies' conclusion that asset transfers
with recourse should be assessed risk-based capital against the full amount of the assets enhanced

19

 (except in low-level recourse transactions), the Agencies are of the opinion that direct credit substitutes that
present equivalent risk should be subject to an equivalent risk-based capital treatment. 




Under this proposal, the general treatment of direct credit substitutes would be to assess capital against the amount
of the asset or pool of assets that is enhanced, rather than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. Like low-level
recourse arrangements, direct credit substitutes that cover only losses below the full effective risk-based capital
requirement for the assets would be assessed a dollar-for-dollar capital requirement.

20

 




The proposed treatment of direct credit substitutes would not affect the current treatment of purchased subordinated
interests and financial standby letters of credit that absorb only the second dollars of losses from the assets enhanced.

21

 The Agencies intend to determine the appropriate risk-based capital treatment of these second dollar loss direct
credit substitutes as part of the development of the multi-level approaches discussed in Section III. In the event
that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of one or more multi-level approaches, the Agencies would expect
to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second
dollar loss direct credit substitutes based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding
positions. 




The currently proposed change to the treatment of direct credit substitutes would primarily affect the following
transactions: 
 Loan servicing rights purchased by banking organizations if they embody a direct credit substitute, 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Subordinated interests purchased by banking organizations that absorb the first dollars of losses from the
underlying loans or pools of loans, and 
 Financial standby letters of credit and other guarantee-like arrangements provided by banking organizations
or thrifts that absorb the first dollars of losses from third-party assets. 



Each of these is discussed below. 


1. Purchased Loan Servicing Rights That Embody a Direct Credit Substitute 


Banking organizations and thrifts that sell receivables often retain the servicing rights on the transferred assets.
Banking organizations and thrifts may also acquire loan servicing rights as separate assets such as purchased mortgage
servicing rights. The terms of some loan servicing agreements require the servicer to absorb credit losses on the
loans, so that the servicer effectively extends a credit enhancement (in the form of recourse or a direct credit substitute)
to the owners of the loans. 
Currently, all of the Agencies treat as recourse retained loan servicing rights that embody an obligation to provide
credit or other loss protection to the owners of the loans. Accordingly, risk-based capital is required against the
full amount of the assets serviced. 
Under the Banking Agencies' proposal, banking organizations with purchased loan servicing rights that extend credit
protection (a direct credit substitute) to the owners of the loans being serviced would also be required to hold capital
against the total outstanding amount of those loans.

22

 Thus, banking organizations that purchase such servicing rights would be required to apply the 100% credit conversion
factor to the amount of assets enhanced (the amount of the loans serviced) to convert this off-balance sheet exposure
into an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.

23

 





The proposed low-level recourse rule would apply if the servicer's maximum retained recourse obligation is contractually
limited to an amount that is less than the amount of capital that would be required against the total amount of the loans
serviced. 


(Question 3) 

The Agencies request comment on whether purchased loan servicing rights agreements exist that obligate the servicer
to provide credit loss protection for only the second dollars of losses from the loans. In determining a servicer's
loss position, the Agencies do not consider access to loan collateral upon default to place the servicer in a second
loss position. 
Adoption of the proposal would align the Banking Agencies' treatment of purchased loan servicing rights that embody
a direct credit substitute with that of the OTS, which already explicitly requires capital support for these arrangements.

24

 Currently, the FDIC and OCC do not explicitly require capital support for these arrangements.

25

 (Capital is required for the allowed portion of the intangible asset generated by the purchase of mortgage servicing
rights, but not for the servicer's separate risk of loss on the underlying loans). The FRB considers purchased mortgage
servicing rights that provide credit protection to be a direct credit substitute and requires capital support for
the risk associated with the underlying mortgage loans. Thus, the proposal would make this treatment explicit in
the FRB's guidelines. 





2. Purchased Subordinated Interests 


The proposal would extend the current risk-based capital treatment of retained subordinated interests to purchased
subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying loans or loan pools. Currently,
banking organizations with purchased subordinated interests are required to hold risk-based capital only against
the carrying value of the subordinated interest. In contrast, the OTS currently treats purchased subordinated interests
in the same manner as retained subordinated interests, 

i.e.,

 as recourse, except for certain high quality subordinated interests.

26

 




Under this proposal, banking organizations with direct credit substitutes in the form of purchased subordinated
interests that absorb the first dollars of losses from the underlying assets would be required to hold risk-based
capital against the carrying value of the subordinated interest plus the outstanding amount of all more senior interests
that the subordinated interest supports.

27

 If the carrying value of the most subordinated portion of the loan, or pool of loans, is less than the full, effective
risk-based capital requirement for the total underlying loan, or pool of loans, then the low-level treatment would
apply, 

i.e.,

 the subordinated portion would be assessed risk-based capital dollar-for-dollar against its carrying value. For
example, if the most subordinated portion of a pool of mortgage assets that qualifies for the 50% risk-weight is held
by a banking organization and its carrying value represents only 3% of the total pool, the capital requirement for
the subordinated portion would be 3% of the total pool rather than 4% (

i.e.,

 the carrying value of the subordinated portion rather than the full effective capital requirement for the pool).





The Banking Agencies' risk-based capital treatment of purchased subordinated interests that represent middle
or mezzanine level loss positions in terms of exposure to total losses from the assets (

i.e.,

 purchased subordinated interests that absorb losses only after prior enhancements that absorb the first dollars
of losses have been fully exhausted) would not be affected by this proposal.

28

 Risk-based capital would continue to be assessed at the 100% risk-weight against the carrying value of this type of
purchased subordinated interest. 




3. Financial Standby Letters of Credit and Guarantee-Like Arrangements 


The proposal would extend the risk-based capital treatment that is currently applied to asset transfers with recourse
to financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements that absorb the first dollars of losses from
third-party assets. The risk-based capital assessment for this form of credit enhancement would be based on the full
amount of the assets enhanced rather than the face amount of the standby letter of credit or guarantee-like arrangement.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The risk-based capital treatment of standby letters of credit or guarantee-like arrangements that represent second
dollar loss enhancements provided for third-party assets would not be affected by this proposal. For purposes of
this part of the proposal, a second dollar loss standby letter of credit or guarantee-like arrangement is one that
covers any percentage portion of loss after some level of the first dollars of loss is covered by another party or through
internal enhancement (

e.g.

, losses from 6 to 20% of the asset value when another party provides first dollar loss enhancement that covers losses
from 0 to 6% of the asset value
). These second dollar loss direct credit substitutes would continue to be assessed risk-based capital based on their
risk-weighted face amounts. 




The proposed rule also addresses participations in financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements.



D. Summary 


The proposal would increase capital requirements for first dollar loss financial standby letters of credit and guarantee-like
arrangements that cover less than 100% of the face value of the total assets enhanced. There would be no change, however,
in the risk-based capital requirement for arrangements that cover the entire amount of losses from a third party's
assets, because the current guidelines already require capital to be held against the full asset amount in such direct
credit substitute transactions. Based on Agency staff discussions with market participants, the Agencies believe
that the majority of first dollar loss financial standby letters of credit and similar arrangements that are provided
by banking organizations and thrifts in the current market are of this latter type. Thus, the Agencies do not expect
that many banking organizations or thrifts would face increased risk-based capital requirements as a result of this
aspect of the proposal. 
Moreover, as was previously mentioned, the Agencies are considering options for matching the risk-based capital
requirement more closely to the risk associated with second dollar loss subordinated interests and financial standby
letters of credit and guarantee-like arrangements in connection with the development of one or more multi-level
approaches. The multi-level approaches, in conjunction with the proposed rules above, would ensure that banking
organizations maintain adequate capital against the risks associated with credit enhancements, would recognize
when an institution has reduced its risk, and make capital treatment more consistent across the various types of depository
institutions. 


III. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 


Many asset securitizations carve up the risk of credit losses from the underlying assets and distribute it to different
parties. The first dollar loss or subordinate position is first to absorb credit losses, the senior investor position
is last, and there may be one or more loss positions in between. Each loss position functions as a credit enhancement
for the more senior loss positions in the structure. Currently, the risk-based capital standards do not vary the rate
of capital assessment with differences in credit risk represented by different credit enhancement or loss positions.

To address this issue, the Agencies are requesting comment on a preliminary proposal to adopt a multi-level approach
that would assess risk-based capital against all banking organization and thrift participants in certain asset
securitizations (

i.e.

, recourse providers, direct credit substitute providers and investors) based on their relative exposure to risk
of loss from the underlying assets. Credit ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
would be used to determine relative exposure to risk of loss. This proposal, referred to as the ratings-based multi-level
approach, would permit reduced risk-based capital assessments for second dollar loss credit enhancers (both recourse
and direct credit substitute providers) and for senior investors in eligible securitization transactions.
 The Agencies also seek comment on whether a multi-level approach is needed for unrated securitization transactions
and, if so, on how such a system could be designed. 




A. Ratings-Based Multi-Level Approach 


1. Threshold Criteria 


The ratings-based multi-level approach would be restricted to transactions involving the securitization of large,
diversified asset pools in which all forms of first dollar loss credit enhancement are either completely free of third-party
performance risk (

i.e.

, the inability of the credit enhancer to perform) or are provided internally as part of the securitization structure,
as specified below. The diversification requirement and the requirement that all first dollar loss credit enhancement
be free from third-party performance risk are intended to protect the first dollar loss enhancement from default
risk associated with any single party. For purposes of applying a multi-level approach, it is important to minimize
the possibility that the first dollar loss enhancement will be exhausted because the presence of this prior enhancement
will be the basis, in most transactions, for allowing lower risk-based capital assessments on the second dollar loss
and senior positions. 
For a transaction to qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach, the first dollar loss credit enhancement
could be provided in any of the following four ways: 
 Cash collateral accounts;
 




 Subordinated interests or classes of securities; 
 Spread accounts, including those that are funded initially with a loan that is repaid from excess cash flows;
 and 




 Other forms of overcollateralization involving excess cash flows, 

e.g.

, placing excess receivables into the pool so that total cash flows expected to be received exceed cash flows needed
to pay investors. 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Cash collateral accounts and subordinated interests are free of third-party performance risk because they stand
ready to absorb a given percentage of total losses from the underlying assets regardless of the financial condition
of the party that funds the cash collateral account or holds the subordinated interest. Spread accounts and other
forms of overcollateralization can provide a similar type of insulation from exposure to any one party if the asset
securitization is based on a large, well diversified pool of assets. These forms of internal credit enhancement depend
on expected excess cash flows from the underlying assets and thus are subject to the risk that the excess cash may not
materialize if default rates among the underlying borrowers exceed expectations. Restricting application of the
ratings-based multi-level approach to large, well diversified asset pools is intended to minimize this risk. 
Transactions with first dollar loss credit enhancements that are subject to third-party performance risk, such
as financial standby letters of credit or repurchase obligations (which are subject to the risk that the provider
fails to perform), and transactions that do not involve the securitization of large, well diversified asset pools
would not be eligible for the ratings-based multi-level approach. Banking organizations and thrifts that participate
as credit enhancers or investors in these types of securitization transactions would not be eligible for the reduced
risk-based capital assessments available under this approach. 


2. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of First Dollar Loss Positions 


The risk-based capital treatment of credit enhancements provided by banking organizations or thrifts in transactions
that qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach would depend on the loss position of the credit enhancement.
First dollar loss enhancements, whether provided as recourse or direct credit substitutes, would be required to
hold capital dollar-for-dollar against their face amount, up to the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced.
 This would essentially incorporate the proposed low-level recourse rule into the treatment of first dollar loss
enhancements under the ratings-based multi-level approach. The dollar-for-dollar capital requirement would
apply to the holders of subordinated interests as well as against the providers of loans used to fund either cash collateral
accounts or spread accounts.
 





As previously noted, the Agencies are continuing to evaluate the risk-based capital requirements for low-level
recourse arrangements and low-level direct credit substitutes. Because the proposed treatment of first dollar
loss positions under the ratings-based multi-level approach incorporates the low-level recourse rule, any modification
of the low-level recourse rule would also affect the proposed treatment of first dollar loss positions. The capital
requirement for these positions should reflect the fact that they generally carry a higher probability of loss relative
to other loss positions in the securitization. However, the Agencies also recognize that the capital requirement
for these positions may appear to be excessive because the probability of total loss for low-level recourse positions
is unlikely to be 100 percent.

Consequently, the Agencies request comment on the proposed treatment of low-level recourse and direct credit substitute
transactions and of first dollar loss positions. In particular, the Agencies invite comment on the following questions:



(Question 4)

 Is the proposed dollar-for-dollar capital requirement (up to the full, effective risk-based capital requirement
for the underlying assets) too high for low-level recourse and direct credit substitute transactions or for first
dollar loss positions? If so, why? 


(Question 5)

 If this proposed capital requirement is too high, how can this be demonstrated or quantified? What methodology could
be used to reduce the capital requirement without jeopardizing safety and soundness? 


(Question 6)

 If less than dollar-for-dollar capital is required for low-level or other first dollar loss positions, then the probability
of loss to the insurance funds increases. How should the Agencies deal with this increased probability of loss? 


3. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Second Dollar Loss Positions 


Second dollar loss enhancements that qualify for the ratings-based multi-level approach, whether provided as recourse
or direct credit substitutes, would be assessed risk-based capital only against the amount of the enhancement, and
not against the more senior portions of the pool. This would continue the Banking Agencies' current risk-based capital
treatment of direct credit substitutes and would significantly reduce the amount of capital that is currently required
for second dollar loss recourse positions. All qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, including subordinated
mortgage-backed securities, would be assigned to the 100% risk-weight category. This would continue the Banking
Agencies' current treatment of purchased subordinated positions. 
To qualify for treatment as a second dollar loss enhancement under the ratings-based multi-level approach, two requirements
must be satisfied:
 





 The securitization transaction itself would have to qualify for this approach (

i.e.

, it would involve a large, well diversified pool of assets and all forms of first dollar loss enhancement would be limited
to the four types that are described above), and 
 The enhancement would have to meet specified minimum credit rating requirements, as explained below. 
For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of middle level or subordinated interests or securities, the interest
or security would need a formal credit rating of at least investment grade from a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization. The rating would be acceptable only if the same rating organization also provided the credit
rating for each rated portion or security of the securitization. Risk-based capital would be assessed against qualifying
middle level or subordinated interests or securities at the 100% risk-weight, based on the carrying value of the interest
or security. No additional risk-based capital would be required for these qualifying interests or securities to
support the more senior interests in the pool. 

See

 Example 1. 
For second dollar loss enhancements in the form of financial standby letters of credit or other guarantee-type arrangements,
the Agencies are considering two alternatives. One alternative would require that the portion of the underlying
asset pool covered by the standby letter of credit must receive a formal credit rating of at least investment grade
from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. See Example 2A. The second alternative would require
that the entire asset pool receive a formal credit rating of investment grade prior to the addition of the standby letter
of credit.
 See Example 2B. 







(Question 7)

 The Agencies request comment on which of these alternatives would be more appropriate for purposes of applying the
ratings-based multi-level approach. 


(Question 8)

 The Agencies request comment on whether the above-described credit rating requirement for second dollar loss enhancements
should be established at a higher level than investment grade. In particular, the Agencies seek information on the
extent to which banking organizations and thrifts currently purchase subordinated interests (including middle
level subordinated interests) and on the typical credit ratings for such purchased subordinated interests. 


(Question 9)

 The Agencies request comment on how application of the ratings-based multi-level approach to second dollar loss
enhancements would affect banking organizations or thrifts that provide financial standby letters of credit for
asset-backed commercial paper programs and other asset securitizations. 
A second dollar loss enhancement could qualify for this treatment even if it were not free of third-party performance
risk. For example, a financial standby letter of credit, which has third party performance risk, could qualify for
this preferential capital treatment if it had qualifying first-loss protection. That is, even though a financial
standby letter of credit would not be considered to qualify for first loss protection for purposes of determining
the capital requirement of more senior loss positions, the standby letter of credit itself could qualify for the treatment
described above. Risk-based capital would be assessed at the 100% risk-weight against the face amount of the standby
letter of credit. 
It is possible that an asset securitization involving a large, well-diversified asset pool might satisfy the above
credit rating requirements simply on the basis of asset quality, without the addition of any credit enhancement.
In this circumstance, the risk of loss associated with providing credit enhancement for investment grade assets
should be the same, regardless of whether the investment grade rating is based solely on asset quality or on some combination
of asset quality plus first dollar loss credit enhancement. Therefore, the Agencies are considering whether to treat
``first dollar loss'' enhancements that provide credit support to pools or portions of pools (depending on which
alternative is selected, as explained above) that have a formal credit rating of at least investment grade rating
on a stand-alone basis in the same manner that qualifying second dollar loss enhancements would be treated under the
ratings-based multi-level approach. See Example 3. 


(Question 10)

 The Agencies request comment on this possible treatment of ``first dollar loss'' enhancements of investment grade
assets. 
Second dollar loss credit enhancements that are rated below investment grade or do not meet the other criteria stated
above would not qualify for reduced capital requirements under the ratings-based multi-level approach.
 The Agencies are considering requiring risk-based capital for such second dollar loss enhancements based on the
amount of the enhancement plus all more senior positions, up to the lower of the size of the enhancement or the full risk-based
capital requirement. (The provider of the second dollar loss enhancement would not be required to hold risk-based
capital against the portion of the asset pool that is covered by the first dollar loss enhancement.) 




The Agencies are concerned that assigning a single capital treatment to all second dollar loss positions rated below
investment grade may not adequately reflect the variation in credit risk of assets rated below investment grade.



(Question 11)

 The Agencies request comment on modifications to the capital requirement for second dollar loss enhancements rated
below investment grade to better reflect different levels of credit risk. 
In the event that the Agencies do not proceed with implementation of a multi-level approach, the Agencies would expect
to propose amendments to the risk-based capital standards that would assess risk-based capital against all second
dollar loss positions based on their face amounts plus the face amounts of all more senior outstanding positions (up
to the maximum size of the second dollar loss position). For this reason the Agencies are particularly interested
in receiving comment on all aspects of the ratings-based multi-level approach.

4. Risk-Based Capital Treatment of Senior Securities 


Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, a senior security could qualify for a 20 percent risk weight, regardless
of the risk-weight of the underlying assets, if: 
 The securitization involves a large, well diversified pool of assets, 
 All prior credit enhancement is limited to the permissible forms, and 
 The security has received the highest possible rating from the same rating organization that provided the
credit rating (if any) associated with the second dollar loss enhancement. 
This preferential risk-based capital treatment for qualifying senior securities would apply regardless of whether
a second dollar loss enhancement for the same transaction also qualifies for preferential treatment under the ratings-based
multi-level approach. Senior securities that do not meet all of the specified conditions would be required to hold
capital at the risk-weight appropriate to the pooled assets, in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards.

The term ``senior security'' would mean that no class of securities has a prior claim to payment from the underlying
assets. Securities that do not have the first claim to payment would be treated as first or second dollar loss enhancements
under the ratings-based multi-level approach (regardless of their credit rating).
 






(Question 12)

 The Agencies request comment on whether a class of securities that receives the highest investment grade rating but
is not the most senior class in a qualifying transaction should also be eligible for the 20% risk-weight category under
the ratings-based multi-level approach. 


(Question 13)

 The Agencies request comment on whether the ratings-based multi-level approach should be further adjusted to reflect
the reduced risk of loss associated with positions rated above the minimum investment grade rating but below the highest
investment grade rating. 
The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatment of senior securities would be restricted to transactions in
which all of the credit enhancement, including all second dollar loss credit enhancements, is either completely
free of third-party performance risk or is provided internally through the securitization structure. Thus, to be
eligible for the reduced risk-based capital assessment, a senior security would have to be supported solely by cash
collateral accounts, subordinated interests (including middle level subordinated positions), spread accounts,
or other forms of overcollateralization. If any part of the total credit enhancement provided is subject to third-party
performance risk, then the senior portion of the issue would not be eligible for a reduced risk-based capital requirement
under the ratings-based multi-level approach, regardless of its rating.
 For example, if a financial standby letter of credit provides second dollar loss enhancement for an asset securitization,
then the senior portion of that securitization would not be eligible for the 20% risk-weight. Risk-based capital
would be held against the amount of the standby letter of credit and all portions of the transaction that are senior
to the standby letter of credit in accordance with the current risk-based capital standards. See Example 4. 




5. Maintenance of Minimum Ratings 


The proposed favorable risk-based capital treatments for second dollar loss enhancements and senior securities
under the ratings-based multi-level approach would be contingent upon maintenance of the required minimum ratings.
If second dollar loss enhancement is downgraded below investment grade, if the senior securities are downgraded
below the highest possible rating, or if either rating is withdrawn by the rating organization that provided the initial
ratings, then the capital requirement would be adjusted accordingly.
 




6. Conclusion 


The Agencies believe that this preliminary proposal for a ratings-based multi-level approach could eliminate or
reduce many of the concerns with the current treatment of recourse and direct credit substitutes. This approach would:

 Incorporate the proposed low-level recourse rule, so that an institution's capital would never exceed the
contractual maximum amount of its exposure; 
 Equalize the treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes that present equivalent risk
of loss; and 
 Add flexibility to the regulatory capital requirements for recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes
by taking into account the different degrees of credit risk associated with first dollar loss and second dollar loss
credit enhancements and senior positions for those asset securitizations where formal credit ratings are provided
for the various positions. 
The use of credit ratings would provide a way for the Agencies to use market determinations of credit quality to identify
different loss positions for capital purposes in an asset securitization structure. The use of ratings could also
enable the approach to be applied to large, well diversified pools of non-homogeneous assets, such as small business
loans, because the market would determine the level of credit support necessary to obtain the various credit ratings.
This may permit the Agencies to give more equitable treatment to a wide variety of transactions and structures in administering
the risk-based capital system. 
The flexibility of such a system would be particularly apparent in transactions that use overcollateralization
to provide first dollar loss credit enhancement because the amount of the excess collateral will vary based on factors
such as the quality of the underlying assets. One pool of assets may require 5% overcollateralization and another
may require 20% overcollateralization to raise the credit quality of the pools to the investment grade level. Even
though the second pool in this example has a greater amount of overcollateralization, the provider of second dollar
loss enhancement for this transaction would not necessarily be in a safer loss position than the provider of second
dollar loss enhancement for the pool that required only 5% overcollateralization. The use of credit ratings to determine
the amount of first dollar loss protection could provide the Agencies with an inherently flexible method for identifying
when an adequate first dollar loss position has been reached and when the second dollar loss position begins.

(Question 14)

 While the agencies believe that a ratings-based multi-level approach may be less costly for banking organizations
and thrifts than a multi-level approach that depends more heavily on quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual
securitizations and the positions within them, the agencies request comment on the costs of obtaining and monitoring
ratings over time and on how these costs might compare with the cost of having to examine each position for purposes
of determining its risk-based capital requirement. 




B. Multi-Level Approach for Unrated Securitizations 




The ratings-based multi-level approach relies on credit ratings to permit reduced risk-based capital requirements
for qualifying credit enhancements and senior securities in certain asset securitizations. However, not all asset
securitizations are rated and, in some securitizations, certain portions may be rated while others may be unrated.
The Agencies recognize that there could be a need for a separate multi-level approach to establish capital requirements
for unrated securitizations and unrated portions of rated securitizations. In theory, there are several ways to
proceed. 


The ideal multi-level approach for unrated securitizations would set capital requirements roughly equivalent
to those for rated securitizations. To determine whether the credit quality of an unrated credit enhancement or security
is similar to a rated credit enhancement or security, banking organizations and thrifts would need to: (1) Know the
current loss position of the credit enhancement or security being evaluated, and (2) have current information on
the credit quality of the underlying assets. This information could then be used in conjunction with a formula that
relates the capital requirement for a credit enhancement or security to its loss position and the credit quality of
the underlying assets. 

Alternatively, the Agencies could develop a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations that assigns capital
requirements based purely on a quantitative measure of sequential loss exposure (that is, the amount of loss protection
provided by more junior positions), without regard to underlying asset quality. A refinement in this approach would
be to develop quantitative measures for each asset type to reflect each type's default characteristics. 

These alternatives represent two of the possible ways to establish a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations.
The Agencies request comment on these and any other options. 

If the Agencies do not proceed with a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations, they expect to extend the
current risk-based capital treatment of recourse transactions to all unrated credit enhancements (

i.e.

, capital would be required against the face amount of the credit enhancement plus all more senior positions). 

The Agencies request comment on the following questions: 




(Question 15)

 Is there a need for a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations and unrated portions of rated securitizations?




(Question 16)

 Should the credit quality of the underlying loans be given additional consideration (beyond that present in the current
risk-based capital requirements) in the capital requirements for unrated transactions? If so, how would this be
accomplished? What other information, if any, should be considered in determining the capital requirements? 



(Question 17)

 Should the loss position of the credit enhancement or security be taken into account in determining capital requirements
for unrated transactions? If so, how would the loss position be determined? In particular, how should forms of prior
enhancement such as overcollateralization and spread accounts be treated? 



(Question 18)

 If the Agencies were to develop a multi-level approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative elements
(the first alternative presented above), what problems might banking organizations and thrifts encounter in obtaining
and maintaining the necessary information on loss positions and credit quality? How could the Agencies ensure consistent
use of this information in determining loss positions and assigning capital requirements? 



(Question 19)

 If the Agencies were to develop a multi-level approach based solely on quantitative measurement of loss positions
(the second alternative presented above), how should such an approach be designed? 




(Question 20)

 How might a multi-level approach be designed so that positions that would not, if rated, qualify for reduced capital
requirements under the ratings-based approach, also would not qualify for reduced capital requirements under the
multi-level approach for unrated transactions? 



(Question 21)

 How can a multi-level approach for unrated securitizations be designed so it does not create an unreasonable bias
toward or away from obtaining ratings? 




IV. Application of Any Final Rules 



The Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice of proposed rulemaking and advance
notice of proposed rulemaking that result in increased risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations
or thrifts would apply only to transactions that are consummated after the effective date of such final rules. The
Agencies intend that any final rules adopted in connection with this notice that result in reduced risk-based capital
requirements for banking organizations or thrifts would apply to all transactions outstanding as of the effective
date of such final rules and to all subsequent transactions. 




V. Sample Applications of the Ratings-Based Multi-Level Approach 




Example 1A_Senior/Subordinated Structure 




Bank A issues three classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of residential
mortgage loans that individually qualify for the 50% risk-weight category_a bottom-level subordinated class of
$12 million, a middle-level subordinated class of $20 million and a senior class of $180 million. Bank A retains the
bottom-level class and sells the other two classes to banking organizations or thrifts. 


Bank A, retaining the bottom-level subordinated class, would be required to hold risk-based capital equal to 4% of
the $212 million pool (

i.e.

, the full effective risk-based capital requirement for the outstanding amount of the assets enhanced). Because
this subordinated class provides sufficient first dollar loss enhancement, a nationally recognized statistical
rating organization gives the $20 million middle class an investment grade rating. Since this class is rated investment
grade, risk-based capital would be held against it at the 100% risk-weight, based solely on its carrying value. That
is, the holder of the middle-level class would not be required to hold any capital against the senior class it supports.
The same rating organization gives its highest credit rating to the $180 million senior class. Since this is the most
senior class, has the highest possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance risk-free, risk-based
capital would be calculated at the 20% risk-weight. Table 1 summarizes this example.

Example 1B_A First Loss Position That Qualifies for the Low-Level Recourse Rule 


Bank A issues three classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of consumer loans
that individually qualify for the 100% risk-weight category_a bottom-level subordinated class of $12 million,
a middle-level subordinated class of $20 million and a senior class of $180 million. Bank A retains the bottom-level
class and sells the other two classes to banking organizations or thrifts. 
Without the proposed low-level recourse rule, Bank A's capital requirement for the $12 million bottom-level subordinated
class would be $16.96 million, 

i.e.

, a full risk-based capital requirement of 8% against the $212 million mortgage pool enhanced by this class. The low-level
recourse rule, however, would allow the risk-based capital requirement to fall below the full effective capital
requirement when the recourse obligation falls below the full effective capital requirement. Thus, the capital
requirement would be the lesser of either the maximum contractual recourse obligation or the full effective capital
requirement. Consequently, the bottom-level class in this example would be assessed dollar-for-dollar capital
up to its $12 million carrying value, for a capital requirement of $12 million. 
Because the bottom-level subordinated class provides sufficient first dollar loss enhancement, a nationally recognized
statistical rating organization gives the $20 million middle class an investment grade rating. Since this class
is rated investment grade, risk-based capital would be assessed against it at the 100% risk-weight, based solely
on its carrying value. That is, the holder of the middle-level class would not be assessed any capital against the senior
class it supports. The same rating organization gives its highest credit rating to the $180 million senior class.
Since this is the most senior class, has the highest possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance
risk-free, risk-based capital would be assessed against this class at the 20% risk-weight. Table 2 summarizes this
example.

Example 2A_Investment Grade Rating Applied to Portion of Pool Covered by Standby Letter of Credit 



The XYZ Company is seeking the highest possible credit rating on an asset-backed commercial paper issuance that is
backed by a large, well-diversified pool of trade receivables. A total of $200 million of commercial paper is issued
against the pool, which contains $212 million worth of trade receivables. Thus, there is $12 million of overcollateralization
available to provide loss protection. 

To obtain the highest rating for the commercial paper, the XYZ Company also purchases a standby letter of credit from
Bank B that covers the next $20 million of losses after the $12 million of overcollateralization. This letter of credit
provides loss protection analogous to the middle-level subordinated class of securities in Examples 1A and 1B above.
A nationally recognized statistical rating organization provides a formal credit rating of investment grade for
the position, i.e., that portion of pool losses that represents the exposure to be covered by the $20 million letter
of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' first alternative for application of the ratings-based multi-level approach
to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against the $20 million standby letter of credit
at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank B would not be required to hold capital
against the additional $180 million supported by the standby letter of credit. If the rating given to the letter of
credit was not at least investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against
the credit equivalent amount of its letter of credit and all senior classes that it supports (in this case, against
$200 million). 



Example 2B_Investment Grade Rating Applied to the Entire Pool of Assets 



The details of the transaction here are identical to those of example 2A, except that the investment grade rating provided
by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization is not on the second loss position, but on the entire $212
million pool, 

prior

 to the addition of Bank B's standby letter of credit. As a result, under the Agencies' second alternative for application
of the ratings-based multi-level approach to this type of transaction, risk-based capital would be assessed against
the $20 million standby letter of credit at the 100% risk-weight, based on its credit equivalent amount. That is, Bank
B would not be required to hold capital against the $180 million of the pool that the standby letter of credit supports,
but does not cover. If the rating given to the entire pool prior to the addition of the letter of credit were not at least
investment grade, then Bank B would be required to hold capital at the 100% risk-weight against the credit equivalent
amount of its letter of credit and all the senior classes that it supports (in this case, against $200 million). 



Example 3_Investment Grade Rating on First Loss Position 



If the Agencies adopt the proposed alternative to treat certain ``first dollar loss'' enhancements that have a formal
credit rating of at least investment grade in the same manner as qualifying second dollar loss enhancements, the following
example would apply: 

Bank C issues two classes of securities that are backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of auto loans_a subordinated
class of $12 million and a senior class of $200 million. Bank C retains the bottom-level class and sells the other class
to either a banking organization or thrift. 

Because of the high credit quality of the underlying loans, a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization
gives the $212 million pool of auto loans a rating equal to one level above investment grade on a stand-alone basis.
The $12 million subordinated class is given an investment grade rating. Since this class is rated investment grade,
risk-based capital would be assessed against it at the 100 percent risk-weight, based solely on its carrying value.
That is, Bank C would not be assessed any capital against the senior class it supports. On the basis of the high credit
quality of the underlying loans, and the loss protection provided by the subordinated class, the same rating organization
gives its highest credit rating to the $200 million senior class. Since this is the most senior class, has the highest
possible credit rating, and all prior enhancements are performance risk-free, risk-based capital would be assessed
against this class at the 20 percent risk-weight. Table 3 summarizes this example.

Example 4_Nonqualifying Senior Position 



Bank D issues two classes of securities backed by a $212 million, well-diversified pool of consumer loans_a subordinated
class of $12 million, which would be rated below investment grade, and a senior class of $200 million. Bank D retains
the bottom-level class and sells the other class to a banking organization or thrift. In the absence of additional
credit enhancements, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization will rate the senior class one grade
below its highest credit rating as a result of the first dollar loss enhancement from the subordinated class. 

Bank D obtains a letter of credit to provide additional enhancement to the transaction from a company whose obligations
have the highest possible credit rating from the same credit rating organization. The credit rating organization
now gives its highest possible credit rating to the senior class in this transaction. However, since this credit rating
is a result of a prior enhancement that is provided in the form of a standby letter of credit, which has performance risk,
risk-based capital would be assessed against the senior class at the 100% risk-weight rather than at the 20% risk-weight.
Under the ratings-based multi-level approach, the 20% risk-weight would only be applied to qualifying senior interests
that are supported by prior credit enhancements that are in the form of overcollateralization, spread accounts,
cash collateral accounts, or subordinated interests. Table 4 summarizes this example.

VI. Additional Issues for Comment 



The Agencies request comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to the risk-based capital treatment of recourse
and direct credit substitutes and on all aspects of the proposal to adopt a multi-level approach. In addition to the
questions set out above, the agencies request comment on the following: 



A. Proposal 



1. Definitions of Recourse and Direct Credit Substitutes 




(Question 22) 

Does the proposed definition of the term ``standard representations and warranties'' provide a workable definition
for determining whether a representation or warranty will be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute?




(Question 23) 

Does the proposed definition of a ``servicer cash advance'' provide a workable definition for determining whether
a cash advance will be considered recourse or a direct credit substitute? 



2. Low-Level Recourse Rule 





(Question 24) 

Would the low-level recourse rule lower transaction costs or otherwise help facilitate the sale or securitization
of banking organization assets? 



3. Treatment of Direct Credit Substitutes 





(Question 25) 

For banking organizations and thrifts in general, or for your particular institution, please answer the following
questions: 

(a) For securitized or pooled transactions, and separately for non-securitized transactions, approximately what
portion of third-party financial standby letters of credit provides less than 100% loss protection for the underlying
assets? What are the typical circumstances of such arrangements? 

(b) For securitized or pooled transactions, and separately for non-securitized transactions, do financial standby
letters of credit typically absorb the first dollars of losses or the second dollars of losses from third-party assets,
as defined in this section of the proposal? What is the approximate dollar amount of financial standby letters of credit
provided by banking organizations and thrifts that absorb the first dollars of losses from third-party assets? 

(c) What is the approximate dollar amount of purchased subordinated interests that absorb the first dollars of losses
from third-party assets, as defined in this section of the proposal? 



B. Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking_Ratings-Based Multi-Level Approach 





(Question 26) 

Should the Agencies require that prior credit enhancements be free of performance risk in order for second dollar
loss enhancements and senior positions to qualify for reduced risk-based capital requirements? 



(Question 27) 

The discussion of the multi-level approach deals with varying the capital requirement in asset securitizations
based on an institution's degree of exposure to credit risk. Does a multi-level approach have any applicability to
sales or participations of individual, secured, unrated loans (including multifamily loans) with recourse under
various loss sharing arrangements? 



VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act 




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

It is hereby certified that the proposed changes to the Agencies' risk-based capital standards will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, in accord with the spirit and purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Most of the transactions that will be affected by the proposed changes are conducted by large banking organizations
and large thrifts. In addition, consistent with current policy, the FRB's revised guidelines generally will not
apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million. The intent of the proposal is to
correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations
to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital
treatment of those transactions. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is not required. 



VIII. Executive Order 12866 



OCC and OTS have determined that the proposed rule described in this notice is not a significant regulatory action
under Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required. The intent of the proposal
is to correct certain inconsistencies in the Agencies' risk-based capital standards and to allow banking organizations
to maintain lower amounts of capital against low-level recourse obligations by adopting the current OTS capital
treatment of those transactions. Under the proposal, each institution's measured risk-based capital ratio may
change. However, this change in measured capital ratios should have no material effect on the safety and soundness
of the banking and thrift industries. Most banks and thrifts have capital ratios much in excess of minimum requirements.
Of the 11,071 commercial banks in operation at the end of September 1993, 10,824 were well-capitalized (risk-based
capital ratios in excess of 10 percent). For the thrift industry, as of June 30, 1993, 1,561 of 1,752 savings associations
were similarly well-capitalized. Given the high level of capitalization in the industry, the net effect on the safety
and soundness of the banking industry and the overall economy should be minimal.

Direct credit substitute 

means the assumption, in form or in substance (other than through providing recourse), of any risk of loss directly
or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim, that exceeds the national bank's pro rata share of the asset
or claim. If a national bank has no claim on the asset, then the assumption of any risk of loss is a direct credit substitute.
Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to: 

(i) Financial guarantee-type standby letters of credit that support financial claims on the account party; 

(ii) Guarantees and guarantee-type instruments backing financial claims;

(iii) Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the
underlying assets; and 

(iv) Purchased loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced
(other than servicer cash advances as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A), or if the servicer makes or assumes
representations and warranties about the loans other than standard representations and warranties as defined in
this section 1(c) of this appendix A). 



* * * * * 



(12) 

Financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit

 means any letter of credit or similar arrangement, however named or described, which represents an irrevocable obligation
to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer (1) to repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account
party, or (2) to make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, in the event that the account
party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary. 



* * * * * 



(20) 

Performance-based standby letter of credit

 means any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however named or described, which represents an irrevocable
obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer to make payment on account of any default by the account party
in the performance of a nonfinancial or commercial obligation. 



* * * * * 



(22) 

Public-sector entities

 includes states, local authorities and governmental subdivisions below the central government level in an OECD
country. In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town or other municipal corporation,
a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or municipal corporation.
This definition does not include commercial companies owned by the public sector. 



* * * * * 



(24) 

Recourse

 means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred
asset that exceeds a pro rata share of a national bank's claim on the asset. If a national bank has no claim on a transferred
asset, then the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution
transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of principal
or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse arrangements
include, but are not limited to: 

(i) Representations and warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties
as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A; 

(ii) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced
(other than servicer cash advances as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A; 

(iii) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the
underlying assets; 

(iv) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and 

(v) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity
of the underlying loan. 



* * * * * 



(28) 

Servicer cash advance 

means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans,
including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely
collection. A servicer cash advance is not recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full
reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount
of the outstanding principal on that loan. 

(29) 

Standard representations and warranties 

means contractual provisions that a national bank extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing rights),
or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are transferred
or servicing rights are acquired and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the transferor or servicer.
Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return of assets in the event
of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties do not constitute recourse or
direct credit substitutes.

Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes

_(1) 

Risk-weighted asset amount_on-balance sheet assets.

 To calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse arrangement that is an on-balance sheet asset, multiply
the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained by the appropriate risk weight using
the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in section 3(a) of this appendix A. 
(2) 

Risk-weighted asset amount_off-balance sheet items.

 To calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute that is not an
on-balance sheet asset, multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount by the appropriate risk weight using
the criteria regarding obligors, guarantors, and collateral listed in section 3(a) of this appendix A. 
(3) 

On-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.

 Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph, the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a recourse arrangement
or direct credit substitute is the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained or assumed.
For purposes of this section 3(c) of this appendix A, the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly
retained or assumed means: 
(i) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the
assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; 
(ii) For a subordinated interest or security, the amount of the subordinated interest or security plus all more senior
interests or securities; 
(iii) For mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the outstanding
amount of the loans serviced; 
(iv) For representations and warranties (other than standard representations and warranties), the amount of the
loans subject to the representations or warranties; and 
(v) For loans strips that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the amount of the loans. 
(4) 

Second-loss position direct credit substitutes.

 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a direct credit substitute is the face amount of the direct credit
substitute if: 
(i) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct
credit substitute fully or partially supports; and 
(ii) The direct credit substitute is either: 
(A) A financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee or other guarantee-type arrangement that absorbs
the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets; or 
(B) A purchased subordinated interest or security that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets.

(5) 

Participations.

 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in a standby letter of credit, guarantee,
or other guarantee-type arrangement is calculated as follows: 
(i) Determine the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount as if the bank held all of the interests in the participation.

(ii) Multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determined under section 3(c)(5)(i) of this appendix
A by the percentage of the bank's participation interest. 
(iii) If the bank is exposed to more than its pro rata share of the risk of loss on the direct credit substitute (

e.g.

, the bank remains secondarily liable on participations held by others), add to the amount computed under section
3(c)(5)(ii) of this appendix A an amount computed as follows: multiply the amount computed under 3(c)(5)(i) by the
percentage of the direct credit substitute held by others and then multiply the result by the risk-weight appropriate
for the holders of those interests. (Note that this risk-weighting is in addition to the risk-weighting done to convert
the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount under section 3(c)(2) of this appendix
A.) 
(6) 

Limitations on risk-based capital requirements

_(i) 

Low-level exposure.

 If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a bank in connection with a recourse
arrangement or a direct credit substitute is less than the risk-based capital required to support the recourse obligation
or direct credit substitute, the risk-based capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability
or exposure to loss. 
(ii) 

Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap.

 If a bank holds a mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with
recourse, capital is required to support the recourse obligation and that percentage of the mortgage-related security
or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital required
for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement for the
underlying loans, calculated as if the bank continued to hold these loans as an on-balance sheet asset.

Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes.

 Banks may engage in activities_such as securitizing pools of assets, selling single assets, and entering into certain
off-balance sheet transactions_that result in the provision of a credit enhancement in the form of a recourse arrangement
or a direct credit substitute. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes
is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct
credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes. 
Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset
a bank has transferred that is in excess of the bank's 

pro rata

 share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an
obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from a default of principal or interest
or any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. 
A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk
of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's 

pro rata

 share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues
a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities,
or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection
to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced. 
For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit
equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such as purchased
subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet and directly or indirectly absorb the first losses
from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure
that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less
the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is already held. This treatment
applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets,
or other claim. The full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than
the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that
absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by
that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted
to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount.

<TEXT>
 

For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a bank may extend in transferring
assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including the acquisition
of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes.

24a

 Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes
for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified
with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights
are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the
return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred
are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller. 





A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled
to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer
advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced
to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. 



* * * * * 



D. * * * 

Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent amount is determined, the amount is then assigned
to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.

40

 The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth
in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the bank's exposure under the item by the applicable credit
conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A. 





However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in section III.B.5 of this appendix
A and section III.D.1 of this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of
assets, or other claim, the full amount of a bank's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with
the item against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute
fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted
may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby letters
of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument
that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount. 

Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement.
However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction (including
a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss
to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the institution if this amount is less than
the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other claim supported by the direct credit
substitutes or recourse arrangement. 

1. 

Items with a 100 percent conversion factor. 

A 100 percent conversion factor applies to direct credit substitutes, which include guarantees, or equivalent instruments,
backing financial claims such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial liabilities, or that back off-balance
sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. Direct credit substitutes include, for
example, financial standby letters of credit, or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements,
that guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial
or individual loans or debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section III.B.5
of this appendix A, purchases of subordinated securities or of servicing rights may give rise to a direct credit substitute.
Direct credit substitutes also include the acquisition of risk participations in bankers acceptances and standby
letters of credit, since both of these transactions, in effect, constitute a guarantee by the acquiring bank that
the underlying account party (obligor) will repay its obligation to the originating, or issuing, institution.

41

 (Standby letters of credit that are performance-related are discussed below and have a credit conversion factor
of 50 percent.) 





The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is converted at 100 percent and the resulting
credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a risk participation

42

 has been conveyed, the full amount of the bank's exposure is still converted at 100 percent. However, the credit equivalent
amount that has been conveyed is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category appropriate to the
obligor, after giving effect to any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate to the institution
acquiring the participation. Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor,
or collateral. For example, the portion of a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic
depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the risk category appropriate to claims guaranteed by those
institutions, that is, the 20 percent risk category.

43

 This approach recognizes that such conveyances replace the originating bank's exposure to the obligor with an exposure
to the institutions acquiring the risk participations.

44

 







In the case of direct credit substitutes that take the form of a syndication as defined in the instructions to the commercial
bank Call Report, that is, where each bank is obligated only for its 

pro rata

 share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating bank, each bank will only include its 

pro rata

 share of its exposure under the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation.

Financial standby letters of credit are distinguished from loan commitments (discussed below) in that standbys
are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) 

fails to repay

 an outstanding loan or debt instrument (direct credit substitute). Performance standby letters of credit (performance
bonds) are irrevocable obligations of the bank to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account party) 

fails to perform

 some other contractual non-financial obligation. 

The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination
of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus,
any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 

irrevocable

 obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer 

fails to repay

 an outstanding debt obligation or 

fails to perform

 a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby
letter of credit or a performance standby. 

A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar
clause) of the bank to fund its customer 

in the normal course

 of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment. 

Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and
forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with
recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages,
is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as a financing
on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the institution's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than
the effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the
amount of total capital that must be maintained against the transaction is equal to the maximum amount of possible
loss under the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term
commitments without direct recourse) are defined in the instructions to the commercial bank Call Report and for risk-based
capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5
of this appendix A. 

Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified
future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward forward deposits placed,

45

 and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward
foreign exchange contracts. 





Securities lent by a bank are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a bank,
as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the
transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively, a bank lends its own securities,
or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the
transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor, to any
collateral delivered to the lending bank, or, if applicable, to the independent custodian acting on the lender's
behalf. Where a bank is acting as agent for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that
is collateralized by cash delivered to the bank, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit
in the bank for purposes of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification
is limited to no more than the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received
and any reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer.

Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes. 

Banking organizations may engage in activities_such as securitizing pools of assets, selling single assets, and
entering into certain off-balance sheet transactions_that result in the provision of a credit enhancement in the
form of a recourse arrangement or a direct credit substitute. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements
and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms
``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes.

Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset
a banking organization has transferred that is in excess of the banking organization's 

pro rata 

share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an
obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from (a) a default of principal or interest
or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party.

A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk
of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the banking organization's 

pro rata

 share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues
a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities,
or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection
to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced.

For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the banking organization's exposure to be converted to an on-balance
sheet credit equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such
as purchased subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the
first losses from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the banking organization's
off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of
assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is
already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports
the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the banking organization's off-balance sheet exposure
may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased
subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities
that are supported by that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the banking organization's
balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. 


For risk-based capital purposes, non-standard representations or warranties a banking organization may extend
in transferring assets (including the transfer of servicing rights), or may assume in other transactions, including
the acquisition of loan servicing rights, are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes.

27a

 Standard representations and warranties, which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes
for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified
with reasonable due diligence by the seller or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights
are acquired. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions that provide for the
return of the assets to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred
are not fully and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller. 





A cash advance by a loan servicer does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled
to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. A servicer cash advance is an arrangement under which the servicer
advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced
to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses
incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. 




* * * * * 




D. * * * 


Before an off-balance sheet item can be incorporated into the risk-based capital ratio, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount of the item must be determined. Once the credit-equivalent is determined, the amount is then assigned to the
appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.

43

 The method for determining the credit-equivalent amount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is set forth
in section III.E.2 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit-equivalent
amount is determined by multiplying the full amount of the banking organization's exposure under the item by the applicable
credit conversion factor as set forth below and in Attachment IV to this appendix A. 






However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections III.B.5 and III.D.1 of
this appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim,
the full amount of a banking organization's exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount
of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with the item
against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute
fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of banking organization's exposure
may be the same or greater than the face amount of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of standby
letters of credit that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of a customer's loan or debt instrument
that is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount. 

Generally, the full face value of an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent
amount and incorporated in weighted risk assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective risk-based capital requirement.
However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute or a recourse transaction is
limited to the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes
the institution if this amount is less than the effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets,
or other claim supported by the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement.

1. 

Items with a 100 percent conversion factor.

 A 100 percent conversion factor applies to direct credit substitutes, which include guarantees, or equivalent instruments,
backing financial claims such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial liabilities, or that back off-balance
sheet items that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. Direct credit substitutes include, for
example, financial standby letters of credit, or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements,
that guarantee repayment of financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial
or individual loans or debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section III.B.5
of this appendix A, purchases of subordinated securities or of servicing rights may give rise to a direct credit substitute.
Direct credit substitutes also include the acquisition of risk participations in bankers acceptances and standby
letters of credit, since both of these transactions, in effect, constitute a guarantee by the acquiring banking organization
that the underlying account party (obligor) will repay its obligation to the originating, or issuing, institution.

44

 (Standby letters of credit that are performance-related are discussed below and have a credit conversion factor
of 50 percent.) 






The full amount of a banking organization's exposure under a direct credit substitute is converted at 100 percent
and the resulting credit-equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant,
the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In the case of a direct credit substitute in which a risk participation

45

 has been conveyed, the full amount of the banking organization's exposure is still converted at 100 percent. However,
the credit-equivalent amount that has been conveyed is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category
appropriate to the obligor, after giving effect to any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate
to the institution acquiring the participation. Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the
obligor, guarantor, or collateral. For example, the portion of a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation
to a U.S. domestic depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the risk category appropriate to claims guaranteed
by those institutions, that is, the 20 percent risk category.

46

 This approach recognizes that such conveyances replace the originating banking organization's exposure to the
obligor with an exposure to the institutions acquiring the risk participations.

47

 









In the case of direct credit substitutes that take the form of a syndication, that is, where each banking organization
is obligated only for its 

pro rata

 share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating banking organization, each banking organization will
only include its 

pro rata

 share of its exposure under the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation. 


Financial standby letters of credit are distinguished from loan commitments (discussed below) in that standbys
are irrevocable obligations of the banking organization to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer (account
party) 

fails to repay

 an outstanding loan or debt instrument (direct credit substitute). Performance standby letters of credit (performance
bonds) are irrevocable obligations of the banking organization to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer
(account party) 

fails to perform

 some other contractual non-financial obligation.

The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination
of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus,
any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 

irrevocable 

obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer 

fails to repay 

an outstanding debt obligation or 

fails to perform 

a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby
letter of credit or a performance standby.

A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar
clause) of the banking organization to fund its customer 

in the normal course 

of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment.

Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and
forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent.
 So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term commitments without direct recourse)
are treated for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse and, accordingly, are also converted at
100 percent. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5 of this appendix A.





Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified
future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward deposits placed,
 and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward
foreign exchange contracts.





Securities lent by a banking organization are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk
of loss. If a banking organization, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify
the customer against loss, then the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively,
a banking organization lends its own securities, or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities
and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight
category appropriate to the obligor, to any collateral delivered to the lending banking organization, or, if applicable,
to the independent custodian acting on the lender's behalf. Where a banking organization is acting as agent for a customer
in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the banking
organization, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit in the banking organization for purposes
of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification is limited to no more than
the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any reinvestment risk
associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer.

Recourse Arrangements and Direct Credit Substitutes. 

For purposes of determining the risk-based capital treatment of securitized pools of assets, sales of single assets,
and certain off-balance sheet transactions in which a bank provides credit enhancement, the following definitions
of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply. The risk-based capital treatment of recourse
arrangements and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section II.D of this appendix A.



Recourse 

is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset a bank
has transferred that is in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises
when an institution transfers an asset and retains an obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the
asset arising from: (a) a default of principal or interest or (b) any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying
obligor or some other party.

A 

direct credit substitute 

is the assumption, in form or in substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly
associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's pro rata share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit
substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues a financial standby letter of credit, purchases
a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities, or purchases servicing rights,
such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection to the third party owners
of the assets being serviced.

For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted into an on-balance sheet credit
equivalent amount typically is the full face value of the direct credit substitute. However, for direct credit substitutes
carried on the balance sheet that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other
claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute
which is itself being assigned to one of the four broad risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless
of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The
full amount of the bank's exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit
substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire
outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by that subordinated interest (to
the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent
amount.

For risk-based capital purposes, nonstandard representations or warranties that a bank may extend in transferring
assets (including the transfer of servicing rights) or assume in other transactions (including the acquisition
of loan servicing rights) are treated as recourse or direct credit substitutes. 

Standard representations and warranties, 

which normally do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes for risk-based capital purposes, are contractual
provisions referring to an existing set of facts that has been verified with reasonable due diligence by the seller
or servicer at the time the assets are transferred or loan servicing rights are acquired. Standard representations
and warranties are also generally accompanied by contractual provisions that provide for the return of the assets
to the seller in instances of fraud or upon determination by the purchaser that the assets transferred are not fully
and properly documented or otherwise as represented by the seller.

A 

servicer cash advance 

is an arrangement under which the servicer of a loan advances funds to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors
or the timely collection of loans. Funds advanced to ensure the timely collection of loans include disbursements
made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses incurred to facilitate the timely collection of a loan. A servicer
cash advance does not constitute recourse or a direct credit substitute if: (a) the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement
for the amount of the advance or (b) for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant
amount of the outstanding principal on that loan.



* * * * *



D. * * *

In order for an off-balance sheet item to be incorporated into a bank's risk-weighted assets, the on-balance sheet


credit equivalent amount 

of the item must first be determined. Once the credit equivalent amount is determined, this amount is assigned to the
appropriate risk category according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.
The method for determining the credit equivalent amount of an interest rate or foreign exchange rate contract is set
forth in section II.E.1 of this appendix A. For most other types of off-balance sheet items, the on-balance sheet credit
equivalent amount is determined by multiplying the 

full amount of the bank's exposure 

under the item by the applicable 

credit conversion factor 

as set forth below.

However, in the case of direct credit substitutes_which are described in detail in sections II.B.6 and II.D.1 of this
appendix A_that directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from an asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full
amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount is the entire outstanding principal
amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of any on-balance sheet exposure associated with
the item which is itself being assigned to one of the four risk weight categories. This treatment applies regardless
of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The
full amount of the bank's exposure that must be converted to a credit equivalent amount may be the same as or greater
than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of financial standby letters of credit
that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of the customer's loan or debt instrument that
is supported by the letter of credit is converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.

Generally, the full amount of the bank's exposure under an off-balance sheet item is converted to an on-balance sheet
credit equivalent amount and then incorporated in risk-weighted assets and, thus, is subject to a full effective
risk-based capital charge. However, the aggregate capital requirement on a first loss direct credit substitute
or a recourse transaction (including a transaction reported as a financing on a bank's balance sheet) is limited to
the maximum contractual amount of loss to which the direct credit substitute or recourse arrangement exposes the
bank if this amount is less than the full effective risk-based capital charge for the asset, pool of assets, or other
claim that is supported by the bank.

1. 

Items With a 100 Percent Conversion Factor. 

A 100 percent conversion factor applies to 

direct credit substitutes,

 which include 

guarantees, 

or equivalent instruments, backing 

financial

 claims, such as outstanding securities, loans, and other financial obligations, or backing off-balance sheet items
that require capital under the risk-based capital framework. These direct credit substitutes include, for example,


financial standby letters of credit,

 or other equivalent irrevocable undertakings or surety arrangements, that effectively guarantee repayment of
financial obligations such as: commercial paper, tax-exempt securities, commercial or individual loans or other
debt obligations, or standby or commercial letters of credit. As described in section II.B.6 of this appendix A, purchases
of 

subordinated securities

 or of 

servicing rights 

may give rise to a direct credit substitute. The full amount of a bank's exposure under a direct credit substitute is
converted at 100 percent and the resulting credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate
to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. 
 


* * * * * 


Therefore, the distinguishing characteristics of a financial standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes
is the combination of irrevocability with the notion that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform
on a financial obligation. Thus, any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an 

irrevocable

 obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third party in the event the customer 

fails to repay

 an outstanding debt obligation will be treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as a financial standby letter of
credit and the full amount of the bank's exposure under the letter of credit will be assigned a 100 percent conversion
factor. (Performance-related standby letters of credit are assigned a conversion factor of 50 percent.) 
A bank that has conveyed a 

risk participation


 in a direct credit substitute to a third party should convert the full amount of its exposure under the direct credit
substitute at a 100 percent conversion factor without deducting the risk participations conveyed. However, portions
of direct credit substitutes that have been conveyed as risk participations to U.S. depository institutions and
OECD banks may then be assigned to the 20 percent risk category that is appropriate for claims guaranteed by U.S. depository
institutions and OECD banks, rather than to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor.
 A bank acquiring a risk participation in a direct credit substitute or bankers acceptance should convert the full
amount of its exposure under the participation at 100 percent and then assign the credit equivalent amount to the risk
category that is appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.



 





In the case of direct credit substitutes that are structured in the form of a 

syndication

 as defined in the instructions for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (that is, where
each bank is obligated only for its 

pro rata 

share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating bank), each bank will only include its 

pro rata

 share of its exposure under the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation. 



Sale and repurchase agreements

 and 

asset sales with recourse,

 if not already included on the balance sheet, and 

forward agreements

 are also converted at 100 percent. Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are
not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of one-to-four family residential mortgages, is to be
converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor
or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions (including those that are reported as financings
on a bank's balance sheet) the amount of the bank's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the full
effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount
of capital that must be maintained against the transaction is limited to the maximum amount of possible loss under
the recourse provision. So-called ``loan strips'' and similar arrangements involving short-term loans sold by
a bank without direct recourse but subject to long-term loan commitments by the bank are accorded the same treatment
for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth
in section II.B.6 of this appendix A. Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase
assets with drawdown which is 

certain

 at a specified future date. These obligations include forward purchases, forward deposits placed, and partly paid
shares and securities but do not include forward foreign exchange rate contracts or commitments to make residential
mortgage loans.

Authority and Issuance 



For the reasons set out in the preamble, part 567 of chapter V of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed
to be amended as follows: 



SUBCHAPTER D_REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS 



PART 567_CAPITAL 



1. The authority citation for part 567 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 12 U.S.C. 1462, 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1476a, 1828(note).




2. Section 567.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (f) and (kk) and by adding new paragraphs (mm), (nn), (oo) and (pp)
to read as follows: 


 567.1 

Definitions. 


* * * * * 


(f) 

Direct credit substitute. 

The term 

direct credit substitute

 means the assumption, in form or substance (other than recourse obligations as defined in  567.1(kk)), of any
risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim, that exceeds the savings association's
pro rata share of the asset or claim. If a savings association has no claim on an asset, the assumption of any risk of loss
is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Financial guarantee-type standby letters of credit that support financial claims on the account party; 
(2) Guarantees and guarantee-type instruments backing financial claims; 
(3) Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying
assets; and 
(4) Purchased loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced
(other than servicer cash advances as defined in  567.1(nn)), or if the servicer makes or assumes representations
or warranties about the loans (other than standard representations and warranties as defined in  567.1(oo)).



* * * * * 


(kk) 

Recourse. 

The term 

recourse

 means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred
asset, that exceeds a pro rata share of the savings association's claim on the asset. If the savings association has
no claim on a transferred asset, the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises
when an institution transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets, or to absorb losses due to:
a default of principal or interest; or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other
party. Recourse arrangements include, but are not limited to: 
(1) Representations or warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties
as defined in  567.1(oo); 
(2) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans serviced (other
than servicer cash advances as defined in  567.1(nn)); 
(3) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than a pro rata share of losses from the underlying
assets; 
(4) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and 
(5) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity
of the underlying loan. 


* * * * * 


(mm) 

Public-sector entities. 

The term 

public-sector entities

 includes states, local authorities and governmental subdivisions below the central government level in an OECD-based
country. In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town or other municipal corporation,
a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or municipal corporation.
This definition does not include commercial companies owned by the public sector. 
(nn) 

Servicer cash advances.

 The term 

servicer cash advances

 means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans,
including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely
collection. A servicer cash advance is not a recourse arrangement (as defined in  567.1(kk)) or a direct credit
substitute (as defined in  567.1(ff)), if: 
(1) The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement; or 
(2) For any one loan, nonreimbursed advances are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding
principal on that loan. 
(oo) 

Standard representations and warranties.

 The term 

standard representations and warranties

 means contractual provisions that a savings association extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing
rights) or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are
transferred or the servicing rights are acquired, and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the
transferor or servicer. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return
of assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties are not recourse
obligations as defined in  567.1(kk) or direct credit substitutes as defined in  567.1(ff). 
(pp) 

Standby letters of credit.

 (1) A financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit is any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however
named or described, which represents an irrevocable obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer: 
(i) To repay money borrowed by or advanced to or for the account of the account party; or 
(ii) To make payment on account of any indebtedness undertaken by the account party, in the event that the account party
fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary. 
(2) A performance-based standby letter of credit is any letter of credit, or similar arrangement, however named or
described, which represents an irrevocable obligation to the beneficiary on the part of the issuer to make payment
on account of any default by the account party in the performance of a nonfinancial or commercial obligation. 
3. In  567.6, the first sentence of paragraph (a)(2) introductory text is revised, the fifth sentence of paragraph
(a)(2) introductory text is removed, paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) and (C) are removed and reserved, paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B)
is revised, and a new paragraph (a)(3) is added to read as follows: 


 567.6 

Risk-based capital credit risk weight categories. 


(a) * * * 
(2) 

Off-balance sheet activities.

 Except for recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes which are specifically discussed in paragraph (a)(3)
of this section, risk weights for off-balance sheet items are determined by the following two-step process. * * *

(i) * * * 
(A) [Reserved] 
(B) Risk participations purchased in bankers acceptances; 
(C) [Reserved] 


* * * * * 


(3) 

Recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes

_(i) 

Risk-weighted asset amounts. 

To calculate the risk-weighted asset amount for a recourse arrangement or for a direct credit substitute, multiply
the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount by the appropriate risk weight using the criteria regarding obligors,
guarantors, and collateral listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 
(ii) 

On-balance sheet credit equivalent amount.

 Except as otherwise provided by this paragraph (a)(3), the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a recourse
arrangement or direct credit substitute is the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained
or assumed. For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly
assumed or retained means: 
(A) For a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, guarantee, or other guarantee-type arrangement, the
assets that the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports; 
(B) For a subordinated interest or security, the amount of the subordinated interest or security plus all more senior
interests or securities;

(C) For mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the outstanding
amount of the loans serviced; 

(D) For representations and warranties (other than standard representations and warranties), the amount of the
loans subject to the representations or warranties; 

(E) For assets sold with recourse, the amount of assets from which risk of loss is directly or indirectly retained excluding
the amount of the recourse liability account established in accordance with GAAP standards; and 

(F) For loans strips that are recourse arrangements or direct credit substitutes, the amount of the loans. 

(iii) 

Second-loss position direct credit substitutes.

 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for certain direct credit substitutes is the face amount of the direct
credit substitute if: 

(A) There is a prior credit enhancement that absorbs the first dollars of loss from the underlying assets that the direct
credit substitute fully or partially supports; and 

(B) The direct credit substitute is a financial guarantee-type standby letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type
arrangement that absorbs the second dollars of loss from the underlying assets. 

(iv) 

Participations.

 The on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for a participation interest in a financial guarantee-type standby
letter of credit, a guarantee or other guarantee-type is calculated as follows: 

(A) Determine the on-balance credit sheet equivalent amount as if the savings association held all of interests in
the participation. See paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the first loss position)
and paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section (direct credit substitute in the second loss position). 

(B) Multiply the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount determined under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section
by the percentage of the savings association's participation interest. 

(C) If the savings association is exposed to more than its pro rata share of the risk of loss on the direct credit substitute
(

e.g.

, the savings association remains secondarily liable on participations held by others), add to the amount computed
under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, an amount computed as follows: multiply the amount computed under
paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, by the percent of the direct credit substitute held by others and the multiply
the result by the risk weight appropriate for other holders of those interest. (Note: This risk-weighting is in addition
to the risk-weighting done to convert the on-balance sheet credit equivalent amount to the risk-weighted asset amount
under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.) 

(v) 

Related on-balance sheet assets.

 To the extent that an asset is included in the calculation of the capital requirement for a recourse arrangement or
direct credit substitute under this paragraph (a)(3), and may also be included as an on-balance sheet asset under
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the asset shall be risk-weighted only under this paragraph (a)(3) except: 

(A) Excess mortgage servicing rights that are recourse arrangements, and purchased mortgage servicing rights and
purchased credit card relationships that are direct credit substitutes are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the related recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes are
risk weighted under this paragraph (a)(3). 

(B) Purchased subordinated interests that are high quality mortgage-related securities are not subject to risk-weighting
under this paragraph (a)(3). Rather, these assets are risk weighted as on-balance sheet assets under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(H)
of this section. 

(vi) 

Limitations on risk-based capital requirement

_(A) 

Low-level exposure.

 If the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss retained or assumed by a savings association in connection
with a recourse arrangement or direct credit substitute is less than the capital required to support the recourse
obligation or direct credit substitute, the capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual liability
or exposure to loss. For assets sold with recourse, the amount of capital required to support the recourse obligation
is limited to the maximum contractual liability or exposure to loss less the amount of the recourse liability account
established in accordance with GAAP standards. 

(B) 

Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap.

 If a savings association holds a mortgage related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage
loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support that percentage of the mortgage related security or participation
certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation, and the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital
required for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement
for the underlying loans, calculated as if the savings association continued to hold these loans as an on-balance
sheet asset. 

(vii) 

Obligations of subsidiaries.

 If a savings association retains a recourse arrangement or assumes a direct credit substitute on the obligation of
a subsidiary that is not an includable subsidiary and the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is an equity
investment in the subsidiary under GAAP standards, the face amount of the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute
is deducted from capital under   567.5(a)(2) and 567.9(c). All other recourse obligations and direct
credit substitutes retained or assumed by a savings association on the obligations of a subsidiary are risk-weighted
in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) (i) through (vi) of this section.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations by proposing requirements for permitting the use of health claims that characterize the relationship
of a substance (food or food component) to a disease or health-related condition on the labeling of meat and poultry
products. FSIS is also proposing regulations establishing a labeling application process for such health claims.
This proposal would permit health claims relating to the association between: (1) Adequate calcium intake and reduced
risk of osteoporosis; (2) diets low in fat and reduced risk of cancer; (3) sodium reduction and reduced risk of high
blood pressure; (4) reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and reduced risk of coronary heart disease;
(5) diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer;
(6) diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary
fiber and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; (7) substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables
(foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) and reduced risk of cancer; and, (8)
folate and reduced risk of neural tube birth defects. FSIS is taking this action to provide consumers with accurate,
informative labeling on meat and poultry products that conforms with such labeling on other foods. FSIS is proposing
regulations to permit health claims that are designed to parallel those issued by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for other foods.

Executive Order 12866 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 



Executive Order 12778 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirement on federally inspected meat and poultry products that
are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however,
exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the
purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the
FMIA or PPIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the
United States. Under the FMIA and PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA and PPIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments. 

No retroactive effect will be given to this proposed rule. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5
and 381.35 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this proposed
rule, if the challenge involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under the FMIA
or PPIA. The administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR parts 335 and 381, subpart W, must be exhausted prior to any
judicial challenge of the application of the provisions of this proposed rule with respect to labeling decisions.




Effect on Small Entities 



The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule would not have a significant effect on small entities, as
defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The proposed regulation would permit the use of health claims
on the labeling of meat and poultry products. Small meat and poultry establishments are exempt from nutrition labeling,
provided the labeling of their products bears no nutrition claims or nutrition information. 

However, small entities with products that currently bear labeling that FSIS is proposing to regulate as a health
claim, e.g. labeling bearing claims that are implied health claims under FSIS's proposed definition of health claim,
may be adversely affected by this regulation. Such labeling would need to be changed to conform to the health claims
regulations. FSIS believes that the number of small firms with products bearing such labeling would not be substantial
because FSIS's current labeling policy does not permit health-related claims which specifically relate foods or
food components to diseases. 

Small manufacturers opting to use health claims on their labeling, as proposed by this regulation, would be required
to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements, thereby, incurring the costs associated with such compliance.
However, the use of health claims on the labeling would be voluntary. Decisions by individual manufacturers on whether
to use such health claims on their product labeling would be based on their conclusions that the benefits would outweigh
the costs of including such health claims on the labeling. 



Paperwork Requirements 



This proposed rule would specify the health claims that would be permitted to be used on the labeling of meat and poultry
products. The proposal would also establish a labeling application process whereby any interested person may submit
a labeling application to FSIS for approval of the use of a health claim not provided for in 9 CFR 317.371 and 381.471.


The proposed labeling application process would require any such labeling application to be submitted in a specific
format and accompanied by the following information: 

(1) An explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of 9 CFR 317.314 and 381.414, 

(2) A summary of scientific data justifying the connection of the health claim to the health benefit; 

(3) Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in product candidates for the use of the proposed
health claim, 

(4) A model health claim; and 

(5) Copies of all information supporting the use of the proposed health claim. 

The paperwork requirements contained in this proposal have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). If you wish to comment on the paperwork burden of this proposed rule, send your comments to: Office of Management
and Budget, Desk Officer for FSIS, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3208, New Executive Office
Building, Washington, DC 20503 and to the Clearance Office, room 404-W, USDA Administration Building, Washington
DC 20250. 



Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this proposal. Written comments should be sent to the
Policy Office and refer to Docket No. 93-002P. Any person desiring an opportunity for an oral presentation of
views, as provided by the Poultry Products Inspection Act, should make such a request to Mr. Charles Edwards, so that
arrangements can be made for such views to be presented. A record will be made of all views orally presented. All comments
submitted in response to this proposal will be available for public inspection at the Policy Office from 9 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Background 



The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

) authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain inspection programs designed to assure consumers
that meat and poultry products distributed to them (including imports) are wholesome, not adulterated, and are properly
marked, labeled, and packaged. FSIS's authority to require nutrition labeling on meat and poultry products is based
upon the statutory provisions on misbranding in the FMIA and PPIA (21 U.S.C. 601(n)(1), (6), (10), and (12) for the
FMIA and 21 U.S.C. 453(h)(1), (6), (10), and (12) for the PPIA), and the general rulemaking provisions of these Acts
(21 U.S.C. 621 and 453, respectively). 

Based upon the Secretary of Agriculture's belief that meat or poultry product labeling would be false or misleading
without nutrition information, FSIS published final regulations on nutrition labeling in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). Corrections and technical amendments to the final regulations were published on August
18, 1993 (58 FR 43787), and September 10, 1993 (58 FR 47624), respectively. The final regulations permit voluntary
nutrition labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products and establishes mandatory nutrition labeling
for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. The final regulations parallel to the maximum extent
possible FDA's nutrition labeling regulations promulgated under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990
(NLEA). 



NLEA Provisions 



The NLEA (Pub. L. 101-535) requires mandatory nutrition labeling for most FDA-regulated packaged food products.
The NLEA addresses health claims by amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to specify, in part, that a food
is misbranded if it bears a claim that expressly or by implication characterizes the relationship of certain nutrients
to a disease or health-related condition unless the claim is made in accordance with a regulation authorizing its
use. FDA is directed by the NLEA to adopt health claim regulations to describe the relationship between the nutrient
and the disease or health-related condition, and the significance of the nutrient in affecting the disease or health-related
condition. 

The NLEA requires the regulations to prohibit health claims for foods which FDA determines contain any nutrient in
an amount which increases to persons in the general population the risk of a diet-related disease or health condition,
taking into account the significance of the food in the total daily diet. However, the NLEA also provides that FDA may
by regulation permit such a claim based on a finding that it would assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary
practices, and based on a requirement that the label or labeling disclose the presence of the nutrient in conjunction
with the claim. 

To assure the validity of health claims, the NLEA requires that such claims be supported by a sound body of scientific
evidence that establishes the relationship between a food or food component and a particular disease or health-related
condition. The data must clearly demonstrate that the proposed claim is valid, and that the benefits featured in the
claim pertain to the general U.S. population or to an identified U.S. population subgroup, e.g., the elderly. A few
unconfirmed studies, preliminary or incompletely documented data, or significantly contradictory findings do
not constitute a sound body of evidence. In addition, the NLEA requires that significant agreement exists among qualified
experts that the claim is valid. ``Qualified experts'' include individuals whose training and experience have produced
a general or specific scientific expertise in the diet/health topic being considered for a specific claim. 



Current FSIS Policy 



FSIS does not permit health claims explicitly linking foods or food components to diet-related diseases or health
conditions. FSIS does permit statements informing consumers that a food can be part of a specific dietary pattern
to meet an organization's dietary guidelines or that a product was developed to help consumers follow a specific dietary
pattern. The rationale adopted by FSIS for approving such statements is to encourage labeling which supplements
the information contained in the nutrition label with information that provides truthful data about a product's
nutritional characteristics, and provides generally accepted information about how a product satisfies consumers'
total dietary requirements. 

To implement the use of health-related claims on labeling, FSIS provides general guidelines and objectives which
permit statements if they are based on a consensus of medical and scientific information, emphasize that good nutrition
is a function of the total diet, and are reasonably uniform from product to product. The following is an example of a
health-related claim that would be permitted currently: 




This product was specifically developed to help you follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for sodium, fat,
and cholesterol. For further information on the Dietary Guidelines call * * *.



FSIS Regulatory Actions 



FSIS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) in the 

Federal Register

 on April 2, 1991 (56 FR 13564), advising of its intent to publish a proposed rule on nutrition labeling. In regard to
health claims, FSIS stated that it expected to adopt the health claim policies established by FDA, as appropriate,
to meet the needs of meat and poultry products. In its proposed regulations on nutrition labeling published in the


Federal Register

 on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60302), and in its final nutrition labeling regulations, FSIS reiterated its intent to
publish a proposed regulation on health claims in line with FDA's policies. At the time FSIS's final nutrition labeling
regulations were published, the health claims issue was still under study by FSIS.

<PARENT> FR940525-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Most of the comments received in response to the ANPR regarding health claims addressed the need for these types of
claims to inform and remind consumers about the relationship between diet and health. The comments stressed that
such claims must be supported by strong scientific consensus. Commenters also emphasized the importance of working
with FDA to bring about uniformity in health claims regulations so that health messages may be of substantial use to
consumers. 



Alternative Considered 



In developing this proposed rule, FSIS considered an alternative to improve the efficiency of establishing regulations
to permit health claims on the labeling of meat and poultry products. Under the alternative, FSIS would not issue regulations
to authorize the use of health claims, but, rather, would permit health claims that are authorized by FDA. In approving
labeling applications, FSIS would refer to FDA regulations to specify the conditions under which health claims may
be used on the labeling of products under USDA inspection. FSIS relied heavily on FDA's decisions about the validity
and significance of the relationship between the substances and diseases that are subjects of this proposal, and
would continue to do so for future claims. 

Because health claims are diet-related, FSIS believes they are invariably applicable to food products regulated
by both FSIS and FDA. Many foods from different food categories can be used alone or as ingredients in other products;
for example, as components of meals containing fish, meat, or poultry. FSIS is interested in receiving comments on
the alternative approach it considered. Comments should address the impact such an alternative might have on the
use of health claims on meat and poultry products, and what other actions FSIS should take to ensure that health claims
and criteria for their use are compatible for all food products. Such comments will be given serious consideration
in FSIS's decision on a final rule for health claims. 



FDA Health Claims Regulations 



In response to the provisions of the NLEA that bear on health claims, FDA adopted general requirements for such claims
in a final regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478). FDA's approach to establish general requirements in conformity to the NLEA provisions
is detailed in its proposed regulation on this subject published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537). Among other things, the regulation FDA adopted at 21 CFR 101.14 defines a health
claim, including implied claims, and disqualifying nutrient levels for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,
or sodium. The regulation prohibits health claims on the label or in labeling for a food that exceeds any one of the disqualifying
nutrient levels, unless an exception is made under a specific provision authorizing a health claim. 

As provided in 21 CFR 101.14, when a health claim is made about the effects of consuming a substance at decreased levels,
the substance in the food bearing the claim must meet a regulatory definition for ``low,'' unless an alternative level
is established in the specific regulation authorizing the claim. If the claim is about the effects of consuming a substance
at other than decreased levels, the level of the substance must be sufficiently high to justify the claim. The regulation
also prohibits health claims for any food that contains less than 10 percent of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily
Reference Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed
prior to any nutrient addition. Health claims are not allowed for foods when a substance, other than one for which a
disqualifying nutrient level is established, is present at an inappropriate level as set forth in a specific provision
authorizing a claim. Also, health claims are not allowed on foods for children less than 2 years of age unless they are
specifically provided for by regulation. 

As mandated by the NLEA, FDA evaluated relationships associating nutrients with disease or health-related conditions
with respect to their appropriateness for health claims. The results of the evaluation and detailed discussion on
each relationship, including the materials (studies, publications, etc.) to evaluate their validity, and the conditions
of their use are contained in proposed regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 60566 through 60855), and final regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665, 2739, 2787, and 2820). FDA's final regulations were developed in accordance
with the general requirements contained in 21 CFR 101.14, and authorize seven health claims to describe the following
associations: 

(1) Calcium and osteoporosis, (58 FR 2665); 

(2) Dietary lipids and cancer, (58 FR 2787); 

(3) Sodium and hypertension, (58 FR 2820); 

(4) Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease, (58 FR 2739); 

(5) Fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer, (58 FR 2537); 

(6) Fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary
heart disease, (58 FR 2552); and 

(7) Fruits and vegetables and cancer, (58 FR 2622). 

More recently, FDA published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and neural
tube defects. On January 4, 1994, FDA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 433) that the proposed regulation is considered a final regulation for dietary supplements. FDA advises that
it has no intention of taking action against foods in conventional form that are naturally high in folate that bear
a claim about this nutrient-disease relationship so long as the claim complies with the provisions of 21 CFR 101.79
that have become final for dietary supplements by operation of law. However, FDA strongly discourages use of the claim
on foods fortified with folic acid until it finalizes the October 14, 1993, proposal.

<TEXT>
 

In reaching its decision regarding the health claims, FDA reviewed the conclusions of many Federal government consensus
documents, Life Sciences Research Office reports, and recent scientific articles. In addition, it considered all
comments received in response to its proposed rules. Among the scientific evidence reviewed were the Department
of Health and Human Services (DHHS) publication ``The Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health,'' U.S. Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1988; the USDA and DHHS publication ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines
for Americans,'' 3rd ed., Home and Garden Bulletin No. 232, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington DC, 1990;
and the DHHS publication ``The Lipid Research Clinics Population Studies Data Book,'' vol. II, ``The Prevalence
Study-Nutrient Intake,'' NIH Publication No. 82-2014, 1982. Also considered were reports of recognized non-governmental
scientific bodies that bear on these topics. These included the Committee on Diet and Health, Food and Nutrition Board,
Commission of Life Sciences, National Research Council's ``Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic
Disease Risk,'' National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1989, and the World Health Organization's ``Diet, Nutrition,
the Prevention of Chronic Diseases,'' Technical Report Series 797, 1990, and the Subcommittee on the Tenth Edition
of the RDAs, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council's ``Recommended Dietary
Allowances,'' National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1989. 



1. Calcium and Osteoporosis 



Based on significant scientific evidence and overwhelming concurrence among experts in this area, FDA authorizes
a health claim relating to an association between adequate calcium intake and osteoporosis on the labels and labeling
of products that meet the regulatory specifications set forth in 21 CFR 101.72. The health claim will relay the message
that an adequate intake of calcium throughout life may delay the development of osteoporosis, and ultimately reduce
the risk of bone fracture in some individuals later in life. Adequate calcium intake levels for the healthy population
as established by the Subcommittee on the Tenth Edition of the RDAs, Food and Nutrition Board, Commission on Life Sciences,
National Research Council are: 800 milligrams per day for males and females 25 years of age and older, 1,200 milligrams
per day for males and females 11 to 24 years of age, and 800 milligrams per day for children (1 to 10 years). By definition,
RDAs are the levels of intakes of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the
Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons. To bear
this claim, a product must be high in calcium (i.e., contain a minimum of 20 percent of the Reference Daily Intake of
1,000 milligrams adopted for nutrition labeling, which is 200 milligrams per reference amount customarily consumed
for the product). 



2. Dietary Lipids and Cancer 



FDA concludes that all publicly available information and authoritative reports support an association between
diets low in fat and risk of some types of cancer. Based on this evidence, FDA authorizes the use of claims relating fat
reduction to reduced risk of some cancers provided that such statements comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 101.73.
The claim would convey the message that diets low in fat may reduce the risk of some types of cancer. The message may not
refer to specific sites of cancer and may not specify types of fat or fatty acids that may be related to the risk of cancer
because of the inconclusiveness of the relevant scientific evidence on these issues. FDA limits this claim to low
fat products, except that fish and game meats may be extra lean. 



3. Sodium and Hypertension 



FDA finds significant scientific agreement that claims relating sodium reduction to reduced risk of high blood pressure
are justified. The scientific evidence shows diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with a low prevalence of hypertension
and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age. Therefore, FDA authorizes in 21 CFR 101.74 claims on the relationship
of dietary sodium and high blood pressure on food labels and labeling. Only food products low in sodium are eligible
to carry this claim. 



4. Dietary Saturated Fat and Cholesterol and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease 



Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common and serious form of cardiovascular disease. High blood total- and
low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major risk factors in the development of CHD. FDA concludes
that the totality of a large body of scientific evidence provides strong and consistent support that diets high in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with increased risk of CHD. Based on this conclusion, FDA authorizes claims on foods relating the reduction in dietary
saturated fat and cholesterol to reduced risk of CHD when provided in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 101.75.
The requirements limit this claim to products that are low in fat, low in saturated fat, and low in cholesterol, except
that fish and game meats may be extra lean. 



5. Fiber-Containing Grain Products, Fruits, and Vegetables and Cancer 



FDA concludes that publicly available scientific evidence indicates that diets low in fat and rich in fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables are associated with a decreased risk of some types of cancer. While there is
significant scientific agreement that evidence supports this association, the specific role of total dietary fiber,
fiber components, and other nutrients and substances in these foods in reducing cancer risk is not fully understood.
Based on the evidence, FDA authorizes a health claim in 21 CFR 101.76 relating diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables to reduced risk of some cancers. The message may include a reference to dietary
fiber in a statement about the value of grain products, fruits, and vegetables in reducing cancer risk because fiber
is an identifying marker of the types of foods correlated with the risk reduction. Only low fat products may convey
this claim.

6. Fruits, Vegetables, and Grain Products That Contain Fiber, Particularly Soluble Fiber, and Risk of Coronary Heart
Disease



On the basis of scientific evidence, including recent evidence, FDA finds support for a claim associating diets low
in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables (including legumes), and grain products, foods that
are low in saturated fat and cholesterol and are good sources of dietary fiber, to reduced risk of heart disease. In
authorizing this claim in 21 CFR 101.77, FDA permits the message about the value of these foods to include reference
to dietary fiber and specifies a qualifying criterion for soluble fiber content in the food product bearing the claim.
Other qualifying criteria limit fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol to low levels in the product. 



7. Fruits and Vegetables and Cancer 



FDA concludes that the evidence is not sufficient to attribute reduction in risk of some types of cancer specifically
to vitamin A as 

beta

-carotene, vitamin C, or vitamin E, alone or in combination, or to other components of diets low in fat and high in fruits
and vegetables. However, the evidence does indicate that diets rich in fruits and vegetables, which are generally
low in fat and high in vitamin A as 

beta

-carotene, vitamin C, and dietary fiber, are associated with decreased risk. Therefore, FDA authorizes a health
claim relating substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables to a reduced risk of cancer. The message
must characterize fruits and vegetables as foods that are low in fat and contribute vitamins A and C and dietary fiber
to the diet. Any product displaying this claim must have a low fat content.



8. Folate and Neural Tube Defects 



After reviewing new scientific data, public comments, and recommendations provided by the Folic Acid Subcommittee
of its Food Advisory Committee, FDA has proposed to authorize a health claim for folate and neural tube defects. These
serious birth defects include anencephaly and spina bifida and, although rare, can result in infant mortality or
serious disability. According to proposed 21 CFR 101.79, the claim would specify that women who are capable of becoming
pregnant and who consume adequate amounts of folate daily during their childbearing years may reduce their risk of
having a pregnancy affected by neural tube defects. To bear this proposed claim, a food would need to be a good source
of folate.



FSIS Proposal



FSIS agrees with FDA that Congress enacted the health claims provisions of the NLEA to help U.S. consumers maintain
healthy dietary practices and to protect these consumers from unfounded health claims. As mentioned previously,
FSIS regulates the labeling of meat and poultry products, and has statutory authority to determine that an article
is misbranded if it is false or misleading in any particular. FSIS is proposing regulatory health claims because of
the potential that health claims may be false or misleading to consumers.

FSIS has evaluated FDA's proposed and final regulations for health claims, and has concluded to propose parallel
regulations for meat and poultry products. Based on review of the scientific evidence, FSIS is proposing to authorize
the use of health claims relating to the association between: 

(1) Adequate calcium intake and reduced risk of osteoporosis; 

(2) Diets low in fat and reduced risk of cancer; 

(3) Sodium reduction and reduced risk of high blood pressure; 

(4) Reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; 

(5) Diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and reduced risk of cancer;


(6) Diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary
fiber and reduced risk of coronary heart disease; 

(7) Substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary
fiber, vitamin A, or vitamin C) and reduced risk of cancer; and 

(8) Folate and reduced risk of neural tube birth defects.

The Administrator of FSIS believes that the use of these health claims on the labeling of meat and poultry products
would not be false or misleading. Although FSIS agrees with FDA that there is significant scientific agreement among
qualified experts to support the use of these health claims for the reasons cited in FDA's proposed regulations published
November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537), final regulations published January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478), and proposed regulations
published October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), FSIS is requesting comments on the use of these claims.

As noted previously, the NLEA establishes two distinct components to assure the validity of health claims_a body
of evidence component and a review component that there be significant scientific agreement about the support for
the claim. FDA chose not to define ``significant scientific agreement'' among experts because each situation may
differ with the nature of the claimed substance/disease relationship. The evaluation of scientific evidence and
opinions about that evidence may be somewhat subjective, and not every expert in the field would be expected to approve
or agree with a claim. In deciding whether significant agreement exists, it is necessary to consider both the extent
of agreement and nature of the disagreement on a case-by-case basis. If agreement were assessed under inflexible
criteria, some valid claims could be disallowed where disagreement is not persuasive. FSIS proposes to use the same
flexible approach adopted by FDA in assessing significant scientific agreement about the validity of health of health
claims.



Definition of Health Claim



FSIS concurs with FDA's definition of a health claim and, accordingly, is proposing to define a health claim as any
claim made on the label or in labeling of a meat or poultry product that expressly or by implication, including third
party references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart
symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.
Implied health claims would include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that
suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level
of a substance in the meat or poultry product and a disease or health-related condition. FSIS is proposing to permit
express or implied health claims on the labeling of meat or poultry products if the claim is specifically provided
for in proposed 9 CFR 317.371 and 381.471 for meat and poultry products, respectively.

FSIS views third party endorsements on product labeling as references, made through a name or logo, to an organization
such as a professional society or association that is independent of the product's manufacturer or distributor,
to promote that organization's approval of a product. If the name of an endorsing organization references a particular
disease and the endorsement references a particular food or nutrient, a third party endorsement would constitute
an implied health claim. While third party references often include general information about dietary recommendations
or good nutrition, FSIS is proposing that they be regulated as a health claim if they characterize the relationship
of a substance to a disease or health-related condition. FSIS believes that it would not be misleading to include such
references on food labeling provided such statements are made in a manner that is in compliance with all applicable
provisions of proposed 9 CFR 317.314, 317.371, 381.414, and 381.471. 


Disqualifying Nutrient Levels 


FSIS is proposing to adopt the disqualifying nutrient levels defined by FDA at 21 CFR 101.14(a)(5) with minor modifications.
FDA defines disqualifying levels at 21 CFR 101.14(a)(5) for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium for
individual foods as 13.0 grams (g) of fat, 4.0 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium
per reference amount customarily consumed, per label serving size, and, only for foods with reference amounts customarily
consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. The levels for a main dish product, as defined in 21 CFR 101.13(m)
and that weighs at least 6 ounces, are defined as 19.5 g of fat, 6.0 g of saturated fat, 90 mg of cholesterol or 720 mg of
sodium per label serving size. The levels for a meal product, as defined in 21 CFR 101.13(l) and that weighs at least
10 ounces per labeled serving, are defined as 26.0 g of fat, 8.0 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of
sodium per label serving size. 
FDA's disqualifying levels for total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium represent 20, 30, and 40 percent
of the Daily Reference Value established for each nutrient for individual foods, main dish products, and meal products,
respectively. FSIS believes these levels are appropriate to meet the intent of the NLEA requirement that health claims
be prohibited for foods that, taking into account the makeup of the total daily diet, increase the risk of diet-related
diseases or health conditions for persons in the general population. In setting these levels, FSIS agrees with FDA
that risk not be considered in terms of the impact of consuming a particular food, but, rather, in terms of the role a
food plays in the total diet, and the effects its nutrient levels have on a person's ability to construct a healthy diet.
Consistent with FDA's general requirements for health claims on labeling of products under its jurisdiction, FSIS
is proposing that any one of the levels would disqualify a meat or poultry product from bearing a health claim, unless
an exception is provided under a specific provision authorizing a health claim. 
The disqualifying levels set by FDA for total fat and saturated fat are expressed to one-tenth of a gram. FSIS's nutrition
labeling regulations require that fat and saturated fat be declared in labeling in half-gram increments below 3 g
per serving and to the nearest gram above 3 g. FSIS intends to amend its regulations to change the 3 g to 5 g in a proposed
regulation on technical amendments to be published in the near future. FSIS established the reporting increments
taking into account the adequacy of analytical methods for determining fat and fatty acids in food products. FSIS
is concerned that method precision and natural variations in fat content in foods are such that measurements cannot
be made reliably at higher fat contents to support disqualifying levels with the degree of accuracy implied by levels
set at one-tenth of a gram. Accordingly, FSIS is proposing to adopt disqualifying levels for fat and saturated fat
expressed at increments required for labeling declarations. 
For purposes of making a nutrient content claim, FSIS defines a meal-type product at 9 CFR 317.313(l) and 381.413(l),
in part, as a product that weighs at least 6 ounces, but no more than 12 ounces per serving (container). Meal-type products
weighing more than 12 ounces are evaluated for use of nutrient content claims on a case-by-case basis when labels are
submitted for prior approval. In its final rule on nutrition labeling, FSIS stated that it believes the majority of
meal-type products fall under its purview, and that 78.7 percent of frozen dinners (6.0 to 24.0 ounces) fall between
6 ounces and 12 ounces. FSIS concludes that its definition of meal-type product encompasses the types of products
that FDA defines as main dish products and meal products. To provide consistency with FDA's requirements for health
claims on these types of products, FSIS is proposing to apply FDA's disqualifying levels for main dish products to
FSIS-regulated meal products weighing at least 6 ounces, but less than 10 ounces, and FDA's disqualifying levels
for meal products to FSIS-regulated meal products weighing 10 ounces or more, including those weighing more than
12 ounces. 
FSIS does not believe that FDA's cholesterol disqualifying level of 90 mg per label serving for main dish products
differs measurably from the cholesterol criterion of less than 95 mg per 100 g and labeled serving for ``lean'' and
``extra lean'' claims on meal-type products at 9 CFR 317.362(c) and 381.462(c) when taking into account that cholesterol
is declared in labeling to the nearest 5 mg per serving. Because FSIS requires a minimum weight of 6 ounces (170 g) for
a meal-type product, the labeled-serving basis becomes the limiting basis. Regardless of its weight, an entire meal-type
product must contain less than 95 mg of cholesterol to qualify to use ``lean'' or ``extra lean'' claims. For these reasons,
FSIS concludes that raising the cholesterol disqualifying level from 90 to 95 mg per labeled serving for meal-type
products weighing at least 6 ounces, but less than 10 ounces, is warranted. This action would provide greater consistency
in qualifying criteria for health claims and nutrient content claims on meal-type products in the weight range of
6 ounces up to 10 ounces.

Substances Consumed at Decreased Levels 


FSIS is proposing to adopt FDA's policy that, when a health claim is made about the effects of consuming a substance
at decreased dietary levels, the substance must be a nutrient that meets ``low'' requirements in the food to justify
the claim. To meet ``low'' requirements, FDA requires that the nutrient must meet a regulatory definition for ``low,''
or a specific level established for the nutrient in the regulation authorizing the claim. Of the eight health claims,
FSIS is proposing to authorize six concern effects of consuming nutrients at decreased levels, i.e., the claim related
to hypertension, the three claims related to cancer, and the two claims related to coronary heart disease. 
Scientific evidence discussed previously shows that dietary sodium is associated with hypertension, and that total
fat intake provides the strongest dietary association with cancer. Also, saturated fat and cholesterol in diets
are the major dietary risk factors for heart disease, while total fat in diets affects the risk indirectly through
effects on obesity and reduction of intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. FSIS is proposing that health claims
associating diets with risk of hypertension, cancer, and coronary heart disease may only be made on the labeling of
meat and poultry products that meet the following requirements: 
(1) To bear the proposed claim about hypertension, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements for a ``low
sodium'' claim at 9 CFR 317.361 and 381.461; 
(2) To bear the proposed claims about cancer, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements for a ``low fat''
claim at 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462; and 
(3) To bear the proposed claims about coronary heart disease, a product must meet the nutrient content requirements
for claims for ``low fat,'' ``low saturated fat,'' and ``low cholesterol'' at 9 CFR 317.362 and 381.462. 
In response to comments on its proposed rules about lipids and cancer and lipids and cardiovascular disease, FDA provides
in its final regulations on dietary lipids and cancer and on dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary
heart disease that these claims may be made on fish and game meats that meet the requirements for ``extra lean'' in 21
CFR 101.62. FSIS agrees with FDA that, without such alternative qualifying criteria, many meat, poultry, and fish
products would be prohibited from bearing health claims. 
FSIS has examined the nutritional values for meat and poultry products reported in USDA's Agriculture Handbook No.
8 and concludes that no single-ingredient cut of beef, pork, or lamb can meet the criteria for ``low fat'' or ``low saturated
fat'' or the disqualifying level for cholesterol. While skinless chicken breast meat does meet ``low fat'' and ``low
saturated fat'' criteria, its cholesterol content exceeds the disqualifying level. Of the products examined, only
skinless light meat turkey meets all three requirements. Meat and poultry products that are individual foods and
that meet the ``low fat'' and ``low saturated fat'' criteria, as well as the disqualifying level for cholesterol,
tend to be those that contain lesser amounts of meat or poultry, such as soups, or have 55-gram reference amounts and
are cured or have added water or other ingredients, such as certain luncheon products. 
Many recommendations from public health organizations and authorities and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
advise choosing lean meats, fish, and poultry without skin as a means of achieving nutritious diets low in fat, saturated
fat, and cholesterol. To preclude health claims on many of these products may obstruct the dietary guidance goals
of encouraging consumption of a variety of foods and increased selection of lean meats and poultry by consumers. Meat
and poultry products play an important role in the U.S. dietary pattern because they are consumed by most Americans
on a daily basis and provide protein, B-vitamins, and essential minerals, such as iron and zinc. 
The FSIS regulatory definition for ``extra lean'' may be used on the label or in labeling of a meat or poultry product
when the product contains less than 5 g of fat, less than 2 g of saturated fat, and less than 95 mg of cholesterol per 100
g and reference amount customarily consumed for individual foods and per 100 g and labeled serving size for meal-type
products. For individual foods, the 100-gram density criterion controls qualification for the claim when reference
amounts are below 100 g. For example, products such as cooked meat or poultry cuts with a reference amount of 85 g meet
``extra lean'' requirements only when 85 g of the products contain less than 4.3 g of fat, 1.7 g of saturated fat, and
81 mg of cholesterol. Products such as luncheon meats or poultry lunch products with a reference amount of 55 g meet
the requirements only when 55 g of the products contain less than 2.8 g of fat, 1.1 g of saturated fat, and 52 mg of cholesterol.

Individual foods with reference amounts exceeding 100 g such as mixed dishes not measurable with a cup having a reference
amount of 140 g may not contain more than 5 g of fat, 2 g of saturated fat, and 95 mg of cholesterol in 140 g of the products
to use ``extra lean'' claims. Meal-type products are restricted to no more than 5 g of fat, 2 g of saturated fat, and 95
mg of cholesterol in the entire serving (container) to carry the claim. FSIS concludes that only individual food products
with reference amounts over about 2 ounces (56 g) would be subject to somewhat less stringent requirements than permitted
by ``low fat'' and ``low saturated fat'' criteria and the disqualifying level for cholesterol if permitted to qualify
for health claims based on requirements for ``extra lean'' claims. FSIS also believes, as stated in its proposed rule
on nutrition labeling, that the ``extra lean'' criteria recognize the practice of dietary planning in which a person
consumes servings of a variety of foods that contain different levels of fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and
allow for a diet that will meet the dietary guidelines.

Because FSIS is convinced that it is important to communicate consistent messages about dietary goals, and about
the role meat and poultry products can play in meeting dietary recommendations, it is proposing to provide, as an option,
for meat and poultry products that meet the ``total fat'' and ``cholesterol'' criteria for ``extra lean'' to carry
health claims about cancer, and products that meet all the requirements for the ``extra lean'' claim to carry health
claims about heart disease. Because many meat and poultry products, including individual foods such as mixed dishes
and meal-type products, contain ample amounts of foods from the fruit and vegetable group and/or the grain products
group to be suitable in nature to bear claims about cancer and heart disease, FSIS believes it is appropriate to allow
meat and poultry products meeting ``extra lean'' criteria to qualify for the companion claims about the relationships
of diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products to cancer and heart disease. Such action would be consistent
with dietary guidance efforts to encourage healthful diets by choosing diets with plenty of fruits, vegetables,
and grain products, as well as choosing lean meats and poultry.
To be consistent with the use of ``extra lean'' criteria for health claims about cancer and heart disease, FSIS believes
it is appropriate to permit meat and poultry products that are individual foods to meet the ``extra lean'' cholesterol
criterion to carry the calcium/osteoporosis, sodium/hypertension, and folate/neural tube defects health claims.
To not make this allowance would introduce disparity among meat and poultry products to qualify for all claims. Therefore,
FSIS is proposing to permit meat and poultry products which meet the ``cholesterol'' criterion for ``extra lean''
to carry health claims about osteoporosis, hypertension, and neural tube defects, provided they meet all other requirements
to bear those claims.
FSIS proposes to require that the labeling of a product disclose the presence of any nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying
level in conjunction with a claim when FSIS permits the claim. Therefore, when a claim is allowed on an individual food
despite the fact that its cholesterol level exceeds the disqualifying level, the labeling would be required to carry
a disclosure statement to read ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition Facts] for information about [nutrient requiring
disclosure] and other nutrients,'' e.g., ``See side panel for information about cholesterol and other nutrients,''
or ``See Nutrition Facts for information about cholesterol and other nutrients.'' This action would be consistent
with FDA's disclosure requirements.


Nutritive Value


FSIS agrees with FDA that when claims are made about the effects of consuming a substance at other than decreased levels,
the level of the substance must be sufficiently high to justify the claim. For such claims, FSIS is proposing to adopt
levels required to meet regulatory definitions for ``good source'' or ``high'' prior to any nutrient addition. However,
in defining requirements for nutrient content claims for ``good source'' and ``high'' at 9 CFR 317.354 and 381.454
for meat and poultry products, respectively, FSIS did not provide a specific definition for a meal-type product.
Rather, the claims are allowed for a food contained in a meal-type product based on the reference amount customarily
consumed of the component food. Because the actual serving of a component food, when used as a side dish in a meal, may
be much less than the reference amount, FSIS is concerned that the actual quantitative amount of the substance, e.g.,
calcium or dietary fiber, in the entire meal may not be sufficient to justify use of the claim on the product. To ensure
sufficient levels of substances in a meal-type product, FSIS is proposing to base the qualifying nutrient criteria
on the labeled serving of the entire product.
FSIS believes health claims should not be made on foods that do not make a nutritional contribution to the diet. Therefore,
FSIS is proposing, as a general requirement, to prohibit health claims for any product that contains less than 10 percent
of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily Reference Value for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per
reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition for individual foods and per labeled serving
prior to any nutrient addition for meal-type products. FSIS interprets nutrient addition as addition specifically
to meet the requirements for a health claim. For example, the requirement does not preclude claims on products where
a nutrient is added to meet a standard of identity; a nutrient is added for technological purposes, e.g., L-ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) in curing meats; a non-meat or non-poultry ingredient fortified in accordance with FDA requirements
and policy is used; or, an ingredient that is a nutrient source, e.g., textured vegetable protein, is used.


Additional Limits on Claims


FSIS agrees with FDA that claims should be prohibited for any product where a substance, other than one for which a disqualifying
nutrient level is established, is present at an inappropriate level as specified in the provision authorizing the
claim. For example, a product containing more phosphorus than calcium on a weight-per-weight basis would not be eligible
to bear the calcium/osteoporosis health claim because high levels of dietary phosphorus, when calcium intake is
low, would impair the utilization of calcium by bone. The presence of the claim on a product not having an appropriate
calcium to phosphorus ratio would be misleading in that it would not be possible to get the full calcium benefits from
such a product.

<TEXT>
 

FSIS also agrees with FDA that health claims for children less than 2 years of age should be established by specific
regulations providing for their use. Health claims that concern dietary recommendations for the U.S. adult population
are not meant to apply to children less than 2 years of age. For example, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans states
that the guidelines are ``advice for healthy Americans ages 2 years and over_not for younger children and infants
whose dietary needs differ.'' Accordingly, FSIS is proposing to prohibit only those claims on foods for this age group
that are not specifically provided for by regulation. FSIS will consider health claims on these products and, where
appropriate, will establish specific regulations for their use.


Labeling Applications


FSIS is proposing to establish a labeling application process whereby interested parties may submit a labeling application
to FSIS for approval of the use of a particular health claim in the labeling of a meat or poultry product. The labeling
application would include: (1) An explanation of how the substance qualifies for a health claim under the requirements
in proposed 9 CFR 317.314 and 381.414; (2) a summary of scientific data providing the basis upon which authorizing
a health claim can be justified as providing a health benefit; (3) analytical data showing the amount of the substance
that is present in the meat or poultry product that would be a candidate to bear the claim; (4) a model health claim that
represents label statements for use on a label or in labeling for a meat or poultry product to characterize the relationship
between the substance to a disease or health-related condition; (5) documentation supporting the summary of scientific
data, including copies of any literature searches done by the applicant and of articles cited in the literature and
other information, such as copies of publications cited in review articles and used to perform the analyses; and (6)
a statement signed by the person responsible for preparing the labeling application that, to the best of his or her
knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable, as well as favorable, information
known to him or her to be pertinent to the evaluation of the proposed health claim. The labeling application would be
required to be signed by the applicant or by the applicant's responsible officer or agent.
Upon receipt and review of the labeling application, FSIS would notify the applicant, in writing, that the labeling
application is either being considered for further review or that it has been denied by the Administrator. If the Administrator
summarily denies the labeling application, he or she would notify the applicant, in writing, as to the reason(s) for
the denial, including why the proposed health claim in the labeling was determined by FSIS to be false or misleading,
and would afford the applicant an opportunity to submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification, and
a right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of
the proposed health claim. If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer
and requests a hearing, and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination
to be correct, the Administrator would file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and
the request for hearing, which would constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which would thereafter
be conducted in accordance with the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice. The hearing would be conducted before
an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's Judicial Officer, who is delegated
the authority to make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary would be
conclusive unless, within thirty days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appealed
to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
If the Administrator does not summarily deny the labeling application, he or she would publish in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule to amend the regulations to authorize the use of the health claim. The proposal would also summarize
the labeling application, including where the supporting documentation could be reviewed. The Administrator's
proposed rule would seek comment from consumers, the industry, consumer and industry groups, medical and scientific
professionals, and other interested persons on the labeling application and the use of the proposed health claim.
FSIS believes that the use of health claims has great overall significance to consumer health. Because of the highly
sensitive nature of such claims and the vast amount of medical and scientific studies which are being conducted in
this area, FSIS believes that the solicitation of comments by the Administrator from the public on whether to approve
the use of a particular health claim would foster an open environment and lead to the most informed and well-supported
decision. After public comment has been received and reviewed by FSIS, the Administrator will make a determination
on whether the proposed health claim will be approved for use on the labeling.

If the claim is denied following the review of the public comments, FSIS would notify the applicant by letter of the
basis for the denial, including the reason why the claim on the labeling was determined by the Administrator to be false
or misleading. The applicant would have the opportunity to appeal this decision by instituting a proceeding that
would be conducted under the same procedures specified above if a labeling application were summarily denied by the
Administrator during the initial review. If the claim is approved by the Administrator, FSIS would notify the applicant
by letter and would also publish in the 

Federal Register

 a final regulation regarding the approval of the claim. The final regulation would amend the regulations to authorize
the use of the health claim in the labeling of meat and poultry products. 

FSIS's proposed labeling application process concerning health claims differs from that of FDA as detailed in 21
CFR 101.70. Although FSIS has attempted to harmonize to the maximum extent possible with FDA in most aspects of nutrition
labeling, FDA's rulemaking process regarding health claims differs from FSIS's statutory authority mandated by
Congress under section 7(e) of the FMIA (21 U.S.C. 607(e) and section 8(d) of the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 457(d)). These statutes
afford applicants whose labeling claims are denied by the Administrator the right to appeal that decision to a Federal
court of appeals. Because of these statutory requirements, the Department has promulgated regulations (9 CFR 335.12,
9 CFR 381.233, and 7 CFR 1.130 

et seq

.) that specify the hearing procedures and rules of practice which are used in proceedings before the Secretary under
section 7(e) of the FMIA and section 8(d) of the PPIA. Accordingly, the labeling application process proposed by FSIS
concerning health claims provides applicants with those same rights to a due process administrative hearing if their
claims are denied by the Administrator, and is thereby consistent with FSIS's statutory requirements. 

When the Administrator has determined that a health claim may be used, firms may make claims based on the regulation
provided that: 

1. All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease or health-related relationship are based on, and
consistent with, the conclusions prescribed in the summary of scientific information and proposed health claims;


2. The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion of the substance may have on a particular disease or health-related
condition; 

3. The claim is complete, truthful, and not misleading; 

4. All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material, except
that the label may bear the statement, ``See 

XX

 for information about the relationship between 

XX

 and 

XX

,'' with the blanks filled in with references to the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name
of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition, with the entire claim appearing on the other labeling;


5. The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and, 

6. If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the food is sufficiently low to justify the claim, or, if the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance
at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food is sufficiently high to justify the claim.




Proposed Effective Date 



Because of the nature and complexity of health claims and the consumer's reliance on them in making decisions on food
purchases, FSIS believes it is essential that health claims be conveyed to consumers in an accurate and informative
manner. Therefore, if this proposal is adopted as a final regulation, FSIS would make the final regulation effective
6 months from the date of publication of the final regulation. FSIS believes that this would provide sufficient time
for meat and poultry producers to conform to the new health claim requirements. It is noted, therefore, that the health
claim requirements would not become effective on July 6, 1994, along with the mandatory nutrition labeling regulations.

Authority: 

21 U.S.C. 601-695; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55.




2. A new section 317.314 would be added to read as follows: 



 317.314

Health claims; general requirements. 



(a) 

Definitions. 

For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 

(1) 

Health claim 

means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a meat or meat food product that expressly or by implication, including
third party references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g.,
a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.
Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest,
within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance
in the meat or meat food product and a disease or health-related condition.

(2) 

Substance 

means a specific food or component of a food. 

(3) 

Nutritive value 

means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients,
or providing energy. 

(4) 

Disqualifying nutrient levels 

mean the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a meat or meat food product above which the product
will be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13 grams (g) of fat, 4 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams
(mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving size, and,
only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated
products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant
amount, as defined in  317.309(g)(1), of all nutrients, the per 50-g criterion refers to the prepared form.
Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per labeled serving size or, when applicable,
a per 50-g basis, will disqualify a meat or meat food product from making a health claim unless an exception is provided
for in  317.371, except that: 

(i) The levels for a meal product, as defined in 
 317.313(l), that weighs at least 6 ounces (oz) but less than 10 oz per serving (container), are 20 g of fat, 6 g
of saturated fat, 95 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled serving size. 

(ii) The levels for a meal product, as defined in 
 317.313(l), that weighs 10 oz or more per serving (container), are 26 g of fat, 8 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol,
or 960 mg of sodium per labeled serving size. 

(5) 

Disease or health-related condition 

means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular
disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting
from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition and, thereby,
claims pertaining to such diseases are not subject to  317.314 or  317.370. 

(b) 

Eligibility. 

For a substance to be eligible for a health claim: 

(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population,
or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the labeling application
submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements
of this section. 

(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a meat or meat food product at decreased dietary levels, the substance
must be a nutrient that is required to be included in the label or labeling as set forth in  317.309(b); or 

(3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels: 

(i) The substance must contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(o),
to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and 

(ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary
to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim to be safe and lawful under the applicable food
safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Meat Inspection Act. 

(c) 

Validity requirement. 

The Administrator will approve the use of a health claim only when he or she determines that the claim is not false or
misleading, because it is supported by: 

(1) The totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles); and 

(2) Significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate
such claims.

(d) 

General health claim labeling requirements.

 (1) When the Administrator determines that a health claim meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, and will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to authorize
the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in Part 317 of the regulations, the Administrator
will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to include declaration of the substance. 

(2) When a regulation has been established in this Part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on
the regulation in this part; 

Provided,

 That: 

(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are
based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in  317.371; 

(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of
a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition; 

(iii) The claim is otherwise complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the
substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors
may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific provision in  317.371; 

(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material,
except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, ``See 

XXX

 for information about the relationship between 

XXX

 and 

XXX

,'' with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance,
and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis''),
with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling; 

Provided,

 That, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears
on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such
graphic material; 

(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and 

(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the meat or meat food product is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition
for use of the term ``low'' has been established for that substance under this Part, the substance must be present at
a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established
for the substance in  317.371. If no definition for ``low'' has been established, the level of the substance
must meet the level established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or 

(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level
of the substance is sufficiently high to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the
term ``high'' for that substance has been established under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in  317.371. If no definition for ``high'' has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either
as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve
the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; 

Provided,

 That, where the meat or meat food product that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii)
of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that
amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather
than the labeled serving size (e.g., ``Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated
with many factors. A serving 

XXX

 of ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.'') 

(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any meat or meat food product for which a health
claim is made in accordance with  317.309.

(e) 

Prohibited health claims.

 No express or implied health claim may be made on the label or in labeling for a meat or meat food product unless: 

(1) The claim is specifically provided for in  317.371; and 

(2) The claim conforms to all general provisions of this section as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate
section of  317.371; 

(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the meat or meat
food product, unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in  317.371; or,
unless the Administrator has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present
in the product based on a finding that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices,
and, in accordance with the regulation in this part that makes such a finding, the labeling bears a referral statement
disclosing the nutrient(s) that exceeds the disqualifying level as follows: ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition
Facts] for information about [nutrient requiring disclosure] and other nutrients.'' The statement shall be in easily
legible boldface print or type, in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required
for net quantity of contents, except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity
of contents statement, in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but
no smaller than one-sixteenth of an inch. 

(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined
in the specific provision authorizing the claim in  317.371. 

(5) The label does not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age, except
if the claim is specifically provided for in  317.371. 

(6) Except where provided for in other regulations in this Part, the meat or meat food product contains 10 percent or
more of the Reference Daily Intake or the Daily Reference Value as defined in  317.309 for vitamin A, vitamin
C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition, except
the basis for meal-type products as defined in  317.313(l) shall be per labeled serving size prior to any nutrient
addition. 

(f) 

Applicability.

 The requirements of this section apply to meat and meat food products intended for human consumption that are offered
for sale. 




3. A new section 317.370 would be added to read as follows: 



 317.370 

Labeling applications for health claims. 



(a) Any interested person may submit a labeling application to FSIS for approval of the use of a particular health claim
in the labeling of a meat or meat food product. The labeling application shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except
that the supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer readable disk. Contents of the disk should be in a
standard format, such as ASCII format. (Applicants interested in submitting a disk should contact the Director,
Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, FSIS, Washington, DC 20250 for details). If any part of the material
submitted is in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling
application shall state the applicant's post office address. 

(b) Pertinent information will be considered as part of a labeling application on the basis of specific reference
to such information submitted to and retained in the files of FSIS. Such information may include any findings, along
with the basis of the findings, of an outside panel with expertise in the subject area. However, any reference to unpublished
information furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is
authorized (with the understanding that such information may in whole or in part be subject to release to the public)
in a written statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information shall be accompanied
by reprints or easily readable copies of such references. 

(c) If nonclinical laboratory studies accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect
to each nonclinical study included with the labeling application, either a statement that the study has been conducted
in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of chapter I, title 21, or, if any
such study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.


(d) If clinical or other human investigations accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with
respect to each clinical investigation included with the application, either a statement that the investigation
was conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in part 56 of chapter I, title
21, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with 21 CFR 56.104 or 56.105, and that it was conducted in compliance
with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50 of chapter I, title 21. 

(e) All data and information in a health claim labeling application are available for public disclosure after the
notice of filing of labeling application is issued to the applicant ( 317.370(j)(2)), except that clinical
investigation reports, adverse reaction reports, product experience reports, consumer complaints, and other
similar data and information shall only be available after deletion of: 

(1) Names and any information that would identify the person using the meat or meat food product. 

(2) Names and any information that would identify any third party involved with the report, such as a physician or hospital
or other institution. 

(f) Labeling applications for a health claim shall be submitted to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory
Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250 and shall include
the following data and be submitted in the following form: 








(Date) 



Name of applicant


Post office address


Subject of the labeling application




The undersigned, 

XXX

 submits this labeling application pursuant to 9 CFR 317.370 with respect to (statement of the substance and its health
claim). 

Attached hereto, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following: 

A. Preliminary requirements. A complete explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of  317.314(b).
For labeling applications where the subject substance is a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient, the
applicant should compile a comprehensive list of the specific ingredients that will be added to the meat or meat food
product to supply the substance in the meat or meat food product bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient
listed, the applicant should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of  317.314(b)(3)(ii),
e.g., that its use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction
issued by FSIS, and what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status.

B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim
can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent
with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such
evidence.
The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended
for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group
and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs.
The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus
development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include
answers to such questions as:
1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected?
2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from meat or meat food products containing the
substance occurs for any segment of the population?
3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration?
4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming
the substance?
In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of
the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits
and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall
specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the
total diet.
If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically
address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis
is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly).
If appropriate, the labeling application shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population or subpopulation and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet.
Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition
of the term ``substance'' in  317.314(a)(2).
C. Analytical data. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative meat and
meat food products that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using
methods in accordance with  317.309(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit
the assay method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in the meat or meat
food product. The validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.
D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a label or
in labeling for a meat or meat food product to characterize the relationship between the substance to a disease or health-related
condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section B of the labeling application. The
model health claim shall include:
1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and
2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the
health benefit that is provided.
E. Supporting Documentation. The labeling application shall include the following attachments:
1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the applicant (e.g., Medline).

2. Copies of articles cited in the literature searches and other information as follows:
a. All information relied upon for the support of the health claim, including copies of publications or other information
cited in review articles and used to perform meta-analyses.
b. All information concerning adverse consequences to any segment of the population (e.g., sensitivity to the substance).
c. All information pertaining to the U.S. population. 
F. The applicant is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24 or an environmental
assessment under 21 CFR 25.31.



Yours very truly,



Applicant
By


(Indicate authority)


(g) The data specified under the several lettered headings should be submitted on separate pages or sets of pages,
suitably identified. If such data have already been submitted with an earlier application from the applicant or any
other final labeling application, the present labeling application may incorporate it by specific reference to
the earlier application.
(h) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application
that, to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable
information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her to be pertinent to the evaluation of the proposed
health claim.
(i) The labeling application shall be signed by the applicant or by his or her attorney or agent, or, if a corporation,
by its responsible officer or agent.
(j) 

FSIS action on the labeling application. 

(1) Upon receipt of the labeling application and supporting documentation, the applicant shall be notified, in writing,
of the date on which the labeling application was received. Such notice shall inform the applicant that the labeling
application is undergoing FSIS review and that the applicant shall subsequently be notified of FSIS's decision to
consider for further review or deny the labeling application.
(2) Upon review of the labeling application and supporting documentation, FSIS shall notify the applicant, in writing,
that the labeling application is either being considered for further review or that it has been summarily denied by
the Administrator. FSIS shall deny a labeling application without reviewing the information contained in subsection
B of this part, Summary of Scientific Data, if the information in subsection A of this part, Preliminary Requirements,
is inadequate to explain how the substance conforms to the requirements of  317.314(b).
(3) If the labeling application is summarily denied by the Administrator, the written notification shall state the
reasons therefore, including why FSIS has determined that the proposed health claim is false or misleading. The notification
letter shall inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written statement by way of answer to the notification,
and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's
decision to deny the use of the proposed health claim.
(i) If the applicant fails to accept the determination of the Administrator and files an answer and requests a hearing,
and the Administrator, after review of the answer, determines the initial determination to be correct, the Administrator
shall file with the Hearing Clerk of the Department the notification, answer, and the request for a hearing, which
shall constitute the complaint and answer in the proceeding, which shall thereafter be conducted in accordance with
the Department's Uniform Rules of Practice.
(ii) The hearing shall be conducted before an administrative law judge with the opportunity for appeal to the Department's
Judicial Officer, who shall make the final determination for the Secretary. Any such determination by the Secretary
shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after receipt of notice of such final determination, the applicant appeals
to the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the applicant has its principal place of business or to
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
(4) If the labeling application is not summarily denied by the Administrator, the Administrator shall publish in
the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule to amend the regulations to authorize the use of the health claim. The proposal shall also summarize
the labeling application, including where the supporting documentation can be reviewed. The Administrator's proposed
rule shall seek comment from consumers, the industry, consumer and industry groups, medical and scientific professionals,
and other interested persons on the labeling application and the use of the proposed health claim. After public comment
has been received and reviewed by FSIS, the Administrator shall make a determination on whether the proposed health
claim shall be approved for use on the labeling of meat or meat food products.
(i) If the claim is denied by the Administrator following the review of the public comments, FSIS shall notify the applicant,
in writing, of the basis for the denial, including the reason why the claim on the labeling was determined by FSIS to
be false or misleading. The notification letter shall also inform the applicant that the applicant may submit a written
statement by way of answer to the notification, and that the applicant shall have the right to request a hearing with
respect to the merits or validity of the Administrator's decision to deny the use of the proposed health claim.

4. A new  317.371 would be added to read as follows: 



 317.371 

Health claims. 



(a) 

Calcium and osteoporosis

_(1) 

Relationship between calcium and osteoporosis. 

An inadequate calcium intake contributes to low peak bone mass and has been identified as one of the many risk factors
in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe
that it has the greatest bearing on whether or not a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone
fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate
of bone loss after skeletal maturity. An adequate intake of calcium is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence
and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is
genetically determined. The mechanism through which an adequate calcium intake and optimal peak bone mass reduce
the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence those with higher bone mass
at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss
after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk
of developing osteoporosis. Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium later in life is thought to be important
in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause.


(2) 

Significance of calcium. 

Calcium intake is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, a multifactorial bone disease.
Other factors including a person's sex, race, hormonal status, family history, body stature, level of exercise,
general diet, and specific life style choices such as smoking and excess alcohol consumption affect the risk of osteoporosis.


(i) Heredity and being female are two key factors identifying those individuals at risk for the development of osteoporosis.
Hereditary risk factors include race: Notably, Caucasians and Asians are characterized by low peak bone mass at maturity.
Caucasian women, particularly those of northern European ancestry, experience the highest incidence of osteoporosis-related
bone fracture. American women of African heritage are characterized by the highest peak bone mass and lowest incidence
osteoporotic fracture, despite the fact that they have low calcium intake. 

(ii) Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium throughout life is particularly important for a subpopulation
of individuals at greatest risk of developing osteoporosis and for whom adequate dietary calcium intake may have
the most important beneficial effects on bone health. This target subpopulation includes adolescent and young adult
Caucasian and Asian American women. 

(3) 

Requirements. 

(i) All requirements set forth in 
 317.314 shall be met. 

(ii) Specific requirements. (A) 

Nature of the claim. 

A health claim associating calcium with reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a meat or
meat food product described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; 

Provided

, That: 

(

1

) The claim makes clear that adequate calcium intake throughout life is not the only recognized risk factor in this
multifactorial bone disease by listing specific factors, including a sex, race, and age that place persons at risk
of developing osteoporosis and stating that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are also needed; 

(

2

) The claim does not state or imply that the risk of osteoporosis is equally applicable to the general United States
population. The claim shall identify the populations at particular risk for the development of osteoporosis. These
populations include white (or the term ``Caucasian'') women and Asian women in their bone forming years (approximately
11 to 35 years of age or the phrase ``during teen years or early adult years'' may be used). The claim may also include
menopausal (or the term ``middle-aged'') women, persons with a family history of disease, and elderly (or ``older'')
men and women as being at risk; 

(

) The claim states that adequate calcium intake throughout life is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through
the mechanism of optimizing peak bone mass during adolescence and early adulthood. The phrase ``build and maintain
good bone health'' may be used to convey the concept of optimizing peak bone mass. When reference is made to persons
with a family history of the disease, menopausal women, and elderly men and women, the claim may also state that adequate
calcium intake is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of slowing the rate of the bone loss;

reference amount customarily consumed as defined in  317.312(b), except the basis for meal-type products
as defined in  317.313(l) shall be per labeled serving size. 

(B) 

Nature of the food. 

(

1

) The product shall meet or exceed the requirements for a ``high'' level of calcium as defined in  317.354, except
the basis for meal-type products as defined in  317.313(l) shall be per labeled serving size; 

(

(4) 

Optional information. 

(i) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between calcium and osteoporosis and the significance of the relationship. 

(ii) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have osteoporosis. The source
of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. 

(5) 

Model health claims. 

The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis:


(i) Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens and young adult white and Asian women maintain
good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later in life. 

(ii) [FOR FOODS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH IN CALCIUM] Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens
and young adult white and Asian women maintain good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later
in life. Adequate calcium intake is important, but daily intakes above about 2,000 mg are not likely to provide any
additional benefit. 

(b) 

Dietary lipids and cancer_

(1) 

Relationship between lipids and cancer. 

(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 

(ii) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of
some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific
agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total
fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the
total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism
by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established. 

(iii) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific.
Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites. 

(iv) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently
associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy
(caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FSIS has concluded that evidence from both animal and
human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.


(2) 

Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer. 

(i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 

(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent
of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy
(calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in
vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and
poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.

(c) 

Sodium and high blood pressure

_(1) 

Relationship between sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure).

 (i) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters
of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is
a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the
chemical entity or electrolyte ``sodium'' and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent
sodium by weight. 
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with
a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age. 
(2) 

Significance of sodium in relation to high blood pressure.

 (i) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary
heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing
mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases
as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately
high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates
that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals.
There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all normotensive
individuals as well. 
(ii) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction,
include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension
earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than
others, high blood pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol
consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure. 
(iii) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public
health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide
basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood
pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke. 

(iv) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 mg sodium per day and
an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, which is the Daily Reference Value for sodium. 
(3) 

Requirements.

 (i) All requirements set forth in 
 317.314 shall be met. 
(ii) Specific requirements. (A)

sodium, low salt diet that might reduce the risk of hypertension or high blood pressure. 
(d) 

Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease

_(1) 

Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.

 (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.

 (i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat
and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.

(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less.

for medical advice and treatment. If the claim defines high or normal blood total- or LDL-cholesterol, then it shall
state that individuals with high blood cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment.

(5) 

Model health claims

. The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary saturated
fat and cholesterol and risk of heart disease: 
(i) While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of this
disease. 
(ii) Development of heart disease depends upon many factors, but its risk may be reduced by diets low in saturated fat
and cholesterol and healthy lifestyles. 
(iii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors, including a family history of the disease, high blood
LDL-cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight, cigarette smoking, lack of exercise, and the
type of dietary pattern. A healthful diet low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, as part of a healthy lifestyle,
may lower blood cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease. 
(iv) Many factors, such as family history of the disease, increased blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, high
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and being overweight, contribute to developing heart disease. Eating
a diet low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may help reduce the risk of heart disease. 
(v) Diets low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Heart disease is dependent
upon many factors, including diet, a family history of the disease, elevated blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and physical
inactivity. 
(e) 

Fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer

_(1) 

Relationship between diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer
risk.

 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits,
and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer. Although the specific role of total dietary
fiber, fiber components, and the multiple nutrients and other substances contained in these foods are not fully understood,
many studies have shown that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing foods are associated with reduced risk of
some types of cancer. 
(2)

 Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables and risk of cancer.

 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 

(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Studies in various parts of
the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers.
These diets are generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber. Current
dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend
decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), and grain products (six or more servings daily).

(f) 

Fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary
heart disease

_(1) 

Relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products
that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease.

 (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors

cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include

(iii) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low
in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain
products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that
diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These studies correlate diets
rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced
coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly
soluble fiber. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial,
or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due
to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some
types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these
foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables,
and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease. 

(i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels
in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain
soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet. 
(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products
are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. Recommended total dietary
fiber intakes are about 25 g daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber. 
(iv) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated
fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.
Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower
blood LDL-cholesterol.

types of dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, may reduce the risk of heart disease, a disease associated with
many factors. 
(ii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high
in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber may lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce your risk
of heart disease. 
(g) 

Fruits and vegetables and cancer_

(1) 

Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk. 

(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
(ii) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood,
many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These
studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A,
and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these
nutrients. Currently there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and
vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables,
including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A as 

beta

-carotene, and vitamin C, to displacement of fat from such diets, or to intakes of other substances in these foods which
are not nutrients but may be protective against cancer risk. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and risk
of cancer. 

(i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high.

(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables. Studies in various parts of the world indicate
that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risk of some cancers. These diets are
generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including but not limited to, dietary fiber, vitamin A as 

beta

-carotene, and vitamin C. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance
of desirable body weight, and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), particularly
those fruits and vegetables which contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C. 
(3) 

Requirements. 

(i) All requirements set forth in 
 317.314 shall be met. 
(ii) Specific Requirements. (A)

Folate and neural tube defects

_(1) 

Relationship between folate and neural tube defects

. (i) Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or
serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects
and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the
brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy,
the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant. 
(ii) The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest
evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom
that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing
4 mg (4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products
that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial
that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review of
the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, FDA concluded
that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets,
may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. 
(2) 

Significance of folate. 

(i) Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases
among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest
risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with
a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family
history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural
tube defects but not of other birth defects. 
(ii) Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics,
geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal age
and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those
with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic
acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates
for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast.

(iii) Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated
that about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted
annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years.

(3) 

Requirements

. (i) All requirements set forth in 
 317.314 shall be met. 
(ii) Specific requirements. (A) 

Nature of the claim. 

A health claim associating folate with reduced risk of neural tube defects may be made on the label or labeling of a meat
or meat food product described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; 

Provided,

 That: 
(

1

) In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall use the terms ``folate,'' ``folic acid,'' ``folacin,'' ``folate, a
B vitamin,'' ``folic acid, a B vitamin,'' or ``folacin, a B vitamin''; 
(

2

) In specifying the health-related condition, the claim shall identify the birth defects as ``neural tube defects'',
``birth defects, spina bifida, or anencephaly,'' ``birth defects of the brain or spinal cord anencephaly or spina
bifida,'' or ``spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord''; 


(

3

) The claim shall state that neural tube defects have many causes and shall not imply that folate intake is the only recognized
risk factor for neural tube defects; 
(

4

) In specifying the prevalence of neural tube defects among women in the general population, the claim shall state
that such birth defects ``which, while not widespread, are extremely significant'' or ``* * * birth
defects * * * that, while not widespread, are extremely significant.''; 
(

5

) The claim shall not attribute any specific degree of reduction in risk of neural tube defects, including mention
of the Public Health Service estimate that 50 percent of neural tube defects may be averted annually, to maintaining
an adequate folate intake throughout the childbearing years. The claim shall state that some women may reduce their
risk of a neural tube defect pregnancy by maintaining adequate intakes of folic acid during their childbearing years;

(

6

) Claims on products that contain more than 25 percent of the Reference Daily Intake for folate (100 mcg per serving)
shall state that 1 mg folate per day is the safe upper limit of intake (e.g., ``Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources''); 
(

7

) The claim shall not state that a specified amount of folate (e.g., 400 mcg in a dietary supplement) is more effective
in reducing the risk of neural tube defects than a lower amount (e.g., 100 mcg in a breakfast cereal or from diets rich
in fruit and vegetables);

(

8

) The claim shall identify diets adequate in folate by using phrases such as ``* * * diets that
include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings of vegetables (including
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such as breads, rice, and pasta)
and fortified cereals. Such diets provide many essential minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who do not
eat well-balanced diets or who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate from dietary supplements.'';
or ``Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and
juices, vegetables, including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads,
rice, and pasta, fortified cereals, or a dietary supplement.''; or ``Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can
be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified
cereals, or from dietary supplements.''; and

(

9

) The nutrition label shall include information about the amount of folate in the labeled product. This information
shall be declared after the declaration for iron if only the levels of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron are provided,
or in accordance with  317.309 if other optional vitamins or minerals are declared.

(B) 

Nature of the food.

 (

1

) The product shall meet or exceed the requirements for a ``good source'' level of folate as defined in  317.354,
except the basis for meal-type products as defined in  317.313(l) shall be per labeled serving size;

(

2

) The product may meet the cholesterol criterion for ``extra lean'' as defined in  317.362; and

(

3

) The product shall not contain more than 100 percent of the Reference Daily Intake as defined in  317.309 for
vitamin A as retinol or preformed vitamin A or vitamin D.

(

4

) 

Optional information.

 (i) The claim may specifically identify risk factors for neural tube defects.

(ii) The claim may include information from paragraphs (h) (1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between folate and neural tube defects and the significance of the relationship except for information specifically
prohibited from the claim.

(iii) The claim may state that women with a history of a neural tube defect pregnancy should consult their physicians
or health care providers before becoming pregnant.

(iv) The claim may identify the Daily Value level of 400 mcg of folate per day as the target intake goal.

(

5

) 

Model health claims.

 The following are examples of model health claims that may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between
folate and neural tube defects:

(i) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube birth defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

(ii) Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk
of having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very
serious. They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits,
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who
have had a child with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption
should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

(iii) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may
reduce their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits
and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

(iv) Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is at least 400 mcg daily throughout their childbearing
years may reduce their risk of having a child with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal
cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate,
a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or from a supplement. Women who have had a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect should consult a physician
before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.

(v) Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400 mcg) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their
risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while
not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose
well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings
of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such
as breads, rice, and pasta) or fortified cereals throughout their childbearing years. Such diets provide many essential
minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate
from a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 mcg per day from all sources.



PART 381_POULTRY PRODUCTS INSPECTION REGULATIONS



5. The authority citation for part 381 would continue to read as follows:






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 450, 21 U.S.C. 451-470; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.55.




6. A new  381.414 would be added to read as follows:



 381.414

 Health claims; general requirements.



(a) 

Definitions.

 For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

(1) 

Health claim

 means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a poultry product that expressly or by implication, including third
party references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart
symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition.
Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of communication that suggest,
within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship exists between the presence or level of a substance
in the poultry product and a disease or health-related condition.

(2) 

Substance

 means a specific food or component of a food.

(3) 

Nutritive value

 means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients,
or providing energy.

(4) 

Disqualifying nutrient levels

 mean the levels of total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium in a poultry product above which the product will
be disqualified from making a health claim. These levels are 13 grams (g) of fat, 4 g of saturated fat, 60 milligrams
(mg) of cholesterol, or 480 mg of sodium per reference amount customarily consumed, per labeled serving size, and,
only for foods with reference amounts customarily consumed of 30 g or less or 2 tablespoons or less, per 50 g. For dehydrated
products that must be reconstituted before typical consumption with water or a diluent containing an insignificant
amount, as defined in  381.409(g)(1), of all nutrients, the per 50-g criterion refers to the prepared form.
Any one of the levels, on a per reference amount customarily consumed, a per labeled serving size or, when applicable,
a 50-g basis, will disqualify a poultry product from making a health claim unless an exception is provided for in  381.471,
except that:

(i) The levels for a meal product as defined in  381.413(l) and that weighs at least 6 ounces (oz), but less than
10 oz, per serving (container) are 20 g of fat, 6 g of saturated fat, 95 mg of cholesterol, or 720 mg of sodium per labeled
serving size.

(ii) The levels for a meal product as defined in  381.413(l) and that weighs 10 oz or more per serving (container)
are 26 g of fat, 8 g of saturated fat, 120 mg of cholesterol, or 960 mg of sodium per labeled serving size.

(5) 

Disease or health-related condition

 means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular
disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting
from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition and, thereby,
claims pertaining to such diseases are not subject to  381.414 or  381.470.

(b) 

Eligibility.

 For a substance to be eligible for a health claim:

(1) The substance must be associated with a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population,
or an identified U.S. population subgroup (e.g., the elderly) is at risk, or, alternatively, the labeling application
submitted by the proponent of the claim otherwise explains the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population and the relevance of the claim in context of the total daily diet and satisfies the other requirements
of this section.

(2) If the substance is to be consumed as a component of a poultry product at decreased dietary levels, the substance
must be a nutrient that is required to be included in the label or labeling as set forth in  381.409(b); or

(3) If the substance is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels:

(i) The substance must contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in 21 CFR 170.3(o),
to the food and must retain that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim; and

<PARENT> FR940525-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) The substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary
to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim to be safe and lawful under the applicable food
safety provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. 
(c) 

Validity requirement. 

The Administrator will approve the use of a health claim only when he or she determines that the claim is not false or
misleading, because it is supported by: 
(1) The totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles); and 
(2) Significant scientific agreement among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate
such claims. 
(d) 

General health claim labeling requirements. 

(1) When the Administrator determines that a health claim meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, and will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to authorize
the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in Part 381 of the regulations, the Administrator
will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to include declaration of the substance. 
(2) When a regulation has been established in this Part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on
the regulation in this Part; 

Provided, 

That: 
(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are
based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in  381.471; 
(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of
a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition; 
(iii) The claim is otherwise complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the
substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors
may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific provision in  381.471; 
(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material,
except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, ``See 

XXXX

 for information about the relationship between 

XXXX

 and 

XXXX

,'' with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance,
and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis''),
with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling; 

Provided,

 That, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears
on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such
graphic material; 
(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and 
(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the poultry product is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of
the term ``low'' has been established for that substance under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in  381.471. If no definition for ``low'' has been established, the level of the substance must meet the level
established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or 
(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level
of the substance is sufficiently high to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the
term ``high'' for that substance has been established under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in  381.471. If no definition for ``high'' has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either
as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve
the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; 

Provided,

 That, where the poultry product that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii)
of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that
amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather
than the labeled serving size (e.g., ``Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated
with many factors. A serving of 

XXXX

 ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.'') 
(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any poultry product for which a health claim is
made in accordance with  381.409. 
(e) 

Prohibited health claims.

 No express or implied health claim may be made on the label or in labeling for a poultry product unless: 
(1) The claim is specifically provided for in  381.471; and 
(2) The claim conforms to all general provisions of this section as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate
section of  381.471;

(3) None of the disqualifying levels identified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section is exceeded in the poultry product,
unless specific alternative levels have been established for the substance in  381.471; or, unless the Administrator
has permitted a claim despite the fact that a disqualifying level of a nutrient is present in the product based on a finding
that such a claim will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, and, in accordance with the regulation
in this Part that makes such a finding, the labeling bears a referral statement disclosing the nutrient(s) that exceeds
the disqualifying level as follows: ``See [appropriate panel or Nutrition Facts] for information about [nutrient
requiring disclosure] and other nutrients.'' The statement shall be in easily legible boldface print or type, in
distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, that is no less than that required for net quantity of contents,
except where the size of the claim is less than two times the required size of the net quantity of contents statement,
in which case the referral statement shall be no less than one-half the size of the claim but no smaller than one-sixteenth
of an inch. 
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, no substance is present at an inappropriate level as determined
in the specific provision authorizing the claim in  381.471. 
(5) The label does not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age, except
if the claim is specifically provided for in  381.471. 
(6) Except where provided for in other regulations in this Part, the poultry product contains 10 percent or more of
the Reference Daily Intake or the Daily Reference Value as defined in  381.409 for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron,
calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition, except the
basis for meal-type products as defined in  381.413(l) shall be per labeled serving size prior to any nutrient
addition. 
(f) 

Applicability.

 The requirements of this section apply to poultry products intended for human consumption that are offered for sale.

7. A new  381.470 would be added to read as follows: 

381.470

Labeling applications for health claims. 


(a) Any interested person may submit a labeling application to FSIS for approval of the use of a particular health claim
in the labeling of a poultry product. The labeling application shall be submitted in quadruplicate, except that the
supporting documentation may be submitted on a computer readable disk. Contents of the disk should be in a standard
format, such as ASCII format. (Applicants interested in submitting a disk should contact the Director, Product Assessment
Division, Regulatory Programs, FSIS, Washington, DC 20250 for details). If any part of the material submitted is
in a foreign language, it shall be accompanied by an accurate and complete English translation. The labeling application
shall state the applicant's post office address. 
(b) Pertinent information will be considered as part of an application on the basis of specific reference to such information
submitted to and retained in the files of FSIS. Such information may include any findings, along with the basis of the
findings, of an outside panel with expertise in the subject area. However, any reference to unpublished information
furnished by a person other than the applicant will not be considered unless use of such information is authorized
(with the understanding that such information may in whole or in part be subject to release to the public) in a written
statement signed by the person who submitted it. Any reference to published information shall be accompanied by reprints
or easily readable copies of such references. 
(c) If nonclinical laboratory studies accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with respect
to each nonclinical study included with the application, either a statement that the study has been conducted in compliance
with the good laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of chapter I, title 21, or, if any such study was
not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance. 
(d) If clinical or other human investigations accompany a labeling application, the applicant shall include, with
respect to each clinical investigation included with the application, either a statement that the investigation
was conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in part 56 of chapter I, title
21, or was not subject to such requirements in accordance with 21 CFR 56.104 or 56.105, and that it was conducted in compliance
with the requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50 of chapter I, title 21. 
(e) All data and information in a health claim labeling application are available for public disclosure after the
notice of filing of labeling application is issued to the applicant 
( 381.470(j)(2)), except that clinical investigation reports, adverse reaction reports, product experience
reports, consumer complaints, and other similar data and information shall only be available after deletion of:

(1) Names and any information that would identify the person using the poultry product. 
(2) Names and any information that would identify any third party involved with the report, such as a physician or hospital
or other institution. 
(f) Labeling applications for a health claim shall be submitted to the Director, Food Labeling Division, Regulatory
Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250 and shall include
the following data and be submitted in the following form: 







(Date)

Attached hereto, and constituting a part of this labeling application, are the following: 
A. Preliminary requirements. A complete explanation of how the substance conforms to the requirements of  381.414(b).
For labeling applications where the subject substance is a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient, the
applicant should compile a comprehensive list of the specific ingredients that will be added to the poultry product
to supply the substance in the poultry product bearing the health claim. For each such ingredient listed, the applicant
should state how the ingredient complies with the requirements of  381.414(b)(3)(ii), e.g., that its use is
generally recognized as safe (GRAS), listed as a food additive, or authorized by a prior sanction issued by FSIS, and
what the basis is for the GRAS claim, the food additive status, or prior sanctioned status. 
B. Summary of scientific data. The summary of scientific data provides the basis upon which authorizing a health claim
can be justified as providing the health benefit. The summary must establish that, based on the totality of publicly
available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent
with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), there is significant scientific agreement among
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such
evidence. 
The summary shall state what public health benefit will derive from use of the claim as proposed. If the claim is intended
for a specific group within the population, the summary shall specifically address nutritional needs of such group
and shall include scientific data showing how the claim is likely to assist in meeting such needs. 
The summary shall concentrate on the findings of appropriate review articles, National Institutes of Health consensus
development conferences, and other appropriate resource materials. Issues addressed in the summary shall include
answers to such questions as: 
1. Is there an optimum level of the particular substance 
to be consumed beyond which no benefit would be expected? 
2. Is there any level at which an adverse effect from the substance or from poultry products containing the substance
occurs for any segment of the population? 
3. Are there certain populations that must receive special consideration? 
4. What other nutritional or health factors (both positive and negative) are important to consider when consuming
the substance? 
In addition, the summary of scientific data shall include a detailed analysis of the potential effect of the use of
the proposed claim on food consumption, specifically any change due to significant alterations in eating habits
and corresponding changes in nutrient intake resulting from such changes in food consumption. The latter item shall
specifically address the effect on the intake of nutrients that have beneficial and negative consequences in the
total diet. 
If the claim is intended for a significant subpopulation within the general U.S. population, the analysis shall specifically
address the dietary practices of such group, and shall include data sufficient to demonstrate that the dietary analysis
is representative of such group (e.g., adolescents or the elderly). 
If appropriate, the labeling application shall explain the prevalence of the disease or health-related condition
in the U.S. population or subpopulation and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet. 
Also, the summary shall demonstrate that the substance that is the subject of the proposed claim conforms to the definition
of the term ``substance'' in  381.414(a)(2). 
C. Analytical data. Analytical data that show the amount of the substance that is present in representative poultry
products that would be candidates to bear the claim should be obtained from representative samples using methods
in accordance with  381.409(h). If no USDA or AOAC methods are available, the applicant shall submit the assay
method used, and data establishing the validity of the method for assaying the substance in the poultry product. The
validation data shall include a statistical analysis of the analytical and product variability.

D. Model health claim. One or more model health claims that represent label statements that may be used on a label or
in labeling for a poultry product to characterize the relationship between the substance to a disease or health-related
condition that is justified by the summary of scientific data provided in section B of the labeling application. The
model health claim shall include: 
1. A brief capsulized statement of the relevant conclusions of the summary, and 
2. A statement of how this substance helps the consumer to attain a total dietary pattern or goal associated with the
health benefit that is provided. 
E. Supporting Documentation. The labeling application shall include the following attachments: 
1. Copies of any computer literature searches done by the applicant (e.g., Medline). 
2. Copies of articles cited in the literature searches and other information as follows: 
a. All information relied upon for the support of the health claim, including copies of publications or other information
cited in review articles and used to perform meta-analyses. 
b. All information concerning adverse consequences to any segment of the population (e.g., sensitivity to the substance).

c. All information pertaining to the U.S. population. 
F. The applicant is required to submit either a claim for categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24 or an environmental
assessment under 21 CFR 25.31. 



Yours very truly, 


Applicant 
By 


(Indicate authority) 



(g) The data specified under the several lettered headings should be submitted on separate pages or sets of pages,
suitably identified. If such data have already been submitted with an earlier application from the applicant or any
other final labeling application, the present labeling application may incorporate it by specific reference to
the earlier application. 
(h) The labeling application shall include a statement signed by the person responsible for the labeling application
that, to the best of his or her knowledge, it is a representative and balanced submission that includes unfavorable
information, as well as favorable information, known to him or her to be pertinent to the evaluation of the proposed
health claim.

8. A new section 381.471 would be added to read as follows: 



 381.471 

Health claims. 



(a) 

Calcium and osteoporosis

_(1) 

Relationship between calcium and osteoporosis

 An inadequate calcium intake contributes to low peak bone mass and has been identified as one of the many risk factors
in the development of osteoporosis. Peak bone mass is the total quantity of bone present at maturity, and experts believe
that it has the greatest bearing on whether or not a person will be at risk of developing osteoporosis and related bone
fractures later in life. Another factor that influences total bone mass susceptibility to osteoporosis is the rate
of bone loss after skeletal maturity. An adequate intake of calcium is thought to exert a positive effect during adolescence
and early adulthood in optimizing the amount of bone that is laid down. However, the upper limit of peak bone mass is
genetically determined. The mechanism through which an adequate calcium intake and optimal peak bone mass reduce
the risk of osteoporosis is thought to be as follows. All persons lose bone with age. Hence those with higher bone mass
at maturity take longer to reach the critically reduced mass at which bones can fracture easily. The rate of bone loss
after skeletal maturity also influences the amount of bone present at old age and can influence an individual's risk
of developing osteoporosis. Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium later in life is thought to be important
in reducing the rate of bone loss particularly in the elderly and in women during the first decade following menopause.


(2) 

Significance of calcium. 

Calcium intake is not the only recognized risk factor in the development of osteoporosis, a multifactorial bone disease.
Other factors including a person's sex, race, hormonal status, family history, body stature, level of exercise,
general diet, and specific life style choices such as smoking and excess alcohol consumption affect the risk of osteoporosis.


(i) Heredity and being female are two key factors identifying those individuals at risk for the development of osteoporosis.
Hereditary risk factors include race: Notably, Caucasians and Asians are characterized by low peak bone mass at maturity.
Caucasian women, particularly those of northern European ancestry, experience the highest incidence of osteoporosis-related
bone fracture. American women of African heritage are characterized by the highest peak bone mass and lowest incidence
osteoporotic fracture, despite the fact that they have low calcium intake. 

(ii) Maintenance of an adequate intake of calcium throughout life is particularly important for a subpopulation
of individuals at greatest risk of developing osteoporosis and for whom adequate dietary calcium intake may have
the most important beneficial effects on bone health. This target subpopulation includes adolescent and young adult
Caucasian and Asian American women. 

(3) 

Requirements.

 (i) All requirements set forth in 
 381.414 shall be met. 

(ii) Specific requirements. (A) 

Nature of the claim.

 A health claim associating calcium with reduced risk of osteoporosis may be made on the label or labeling of a poultry
product described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) (B) of this section; 

Provided,

 That: 

(

1

) The claim makes clear that adequate calcium intake throughout life is not the only recognized risk factor in this
multifactorial bone disease by listing specific factors, including a sex, race, and age that place persons at risk
of developing osteoporosis and stating that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are also needed; 

(

2

) The claim does not state or imply that the risk of osteoporosis is equally applicable to the general United States
population. The claim shall identify the populations at particular risk for the development of osteoporosis. These
populations include white (or the term ``Caucasian'') women and Asian women in their bone forming years (approximately
11 to 35 years of age or the phrase ``during teen years or early adult years'' may be used). The claim may also include
menopausal (or the term ``middle-aged'') women, persons with a family history of disease, and elderly (or ``older'')
men and women as being at risk; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-1-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(

3

) The claim states that adequate calcium intake throughout life is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through
the mechanism of optimizing peak bone mass during adolescence and early adulthood. The phrase ``build and maintain
good bone health'' may be used to convey the concept of optimizing peak bone mass. When reference is made to persons
with a family history of the disease, menopausal women, and elderly men and women, the claim may also state that adequate
calcium intake is linked to reduced risk of osteoporosis through the mechanism of slowing the rate of the bone loss;

(

4

) The claim does not attribute any degree of reduction in risk of osteoporosis to maintaining an adequate calcium intake
throughout life; and 

(

5

) The claim states that a total dietary intake greater than 200 percent of the Recommended Daily Intake (2,000 mg of
calcium) has no further known benefit to bone health. This requirement does not apply to poultry products that contain
less than 40 percent of the Recommended Daily Intake of 1,000 mg of calcium per day or 400 mg of calcium per reference
amount customarily consumed as defined in  381.412(b), except the basis for meal-type products as defined
in  381.413(l) shall be per labeled serving size. 

(B) 

Nature of the food.

 (

1

) The product shall meet or exceed the requirements for a ``high'' level of calcium as defined in  381.454, except
the basis for meal-type products as defined in  381.413(l) shall be per labeled serving size; 

(

2

) The product shall not contain more phosphorus than calcium on a weight-per-weight basis; and 

(

3

) The product may meet the cholesterol criterion for ``extra lean'' as defined in  381.462. 

(4) 

Optional information.

 (i) The claim may include information from paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between calcium and osteoporosis and the significance of the relationship. 

(ii) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have osteoporosis. The source
of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. 

(5) 

Model health claims.

 The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between calcium and osteoporosis:


(i) Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens and young adult white and Asian women maintain
good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later in life. 

(ii) [FOR FOODS EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH IN CALCIUM] Regular exercise and a healthy diet with enough calcium helps teens
and young adult white and Asian women maintain good bone health and may reduce their high risk of osteoporosis later
in life. Adequate calcium intake is important, but daily intakes above about 2,000 mg are not likely to provide any
additional benefit. 

(b) 

Dietary lipids and cancer

_(1) 

Relationship between lipids and cancer.

 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 

(ii) Among dietary factors, the strongest positive association has been found between total fat intake and risk of
some types of cancer. Based on the totality of the publicly available scientific evidence, there is significant scientific
agreement among experts, qualified by training and experience to evaluate such evidence, that diets high in total
fat are associated with an increased cancer risk. Research to date, although not conclusive, demonstrates that the
total amount of fats, rather than any specific type of fat, is positively associated with cancer risk. The mechanism
by which total fat affects cancer has not yet been established. 

(iii) A question that has been the subject of considerable research is whether the effect of fat on cancer is site-specific.
Neither human nor animal studies are consistent in the association of fat intake with specific cancer sites. 

(iv) Another question that has been raised is whether the association of total fat intake to cancer risk is independently
associated with energy intakes, or whether the association of fat with cancer risk is the result of the higher energy
(caloric) intake normally associated with high fat intake. FSIS has concluded that evidence from both animal and
human studies indicates that total fat intake alone, independent of energy intake, is associated with cancer risk.


(2) 

Significance of the relationship between fat intake and risk of cancer.

 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 

(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and high in calories. The average U.S. diet is estimated to contain 36 to 37 percent
of calories from total fat. Current dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health
professional organizations recommend that dietary fat intake be reduced to a level of 30 percent or less of energy
(calories) from total fat. In order to reduce intake of total fat, individuals should choose diets which are high in
vegetables, fruits, and grain products (particularly whole grain products), choose lean cuts of meats, fish, and
poultry, substitute low-fat dairy products for higher fat products, and use fats and oils sparingly.

(3) 

Requirements. 

(i) All requirements set forth in 
 381.414 shall be met.
(ii) Specific requirements. (A) 

Nature of the claim. 

A health claim associating diets low in fat with reduced risk of cancer may be made on the label or labeling of a poultry
product described in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section; 

Provided, 

That:
(

1

) The claim states that diets low in fat ``may'' or ``might'' reduce the risk of some cancers;
(

2

) In specifying the disease, the claim uses the terms ``some types of cancer'' or ``some cancers'';
(

3

) In specifying the nutrient, the claim uses the terms ``total fat'' or ``fat'';
(

4

) The claim does not specify types of fat or fatty acids that may be related to the risk of cancer;
(

5

) The claim does not attribute any degree of cancer risk reduction to diets low in fat; and
(

6

) The claim indicates that the development of cancer depends on many factors.
(B) 

Nature of the food. 

The product shall meet the requirements for ``low fat'' as defined in  381.462, except that the product may meet
the total fat and cholesterol criteria for ``extra lean'' in  381.462.
(4) 

Optional information. 

(i) The claim may identify one or more of the following risk factors for development of cancer: Family history of a specific
type of cancer, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation,
exposure to cancer-causing chemicals, and dietary factors.
(ii) The claim may include information from paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between dietary fat and cancer and the significance of the relationship.
(iii) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans.''
(iv) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The source of this
information must be identified, and it must be current information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
(5) 

Model health claims. 

The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary lipids
and cancer:
(i) Development of cancer depends on many factors. A diet low in total fat may reduce the risk of some cancers.
(ii) Eating a healthful diet low in fat may help reduce the risk of some types of cancer. Development of cancer is associated
with many factors, including a family history of the disease, cigarette smoking, and what you eat.
(c) 

Sodium and high blood pressure

Relationship between sodium and hypertension (high blood pressure). 

(i) Hypertension, or high blood pressure, generally means a systolic blood pressure of greater than 140 millimeters
of mercury (mm Hg) or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 90 mm Hg. Normotension, or normal blood pressure, is
a systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Sodium is specified here as the
chemical entity or electrolyte ``sodium'' and is distinguished from sodium chloride, or salt, which is 39 percent
sodium by weight.
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in sodium are associated with a high prevalence of hypertension
or high blood pressure and with increases in blood pressure with age, and that diets low in sodium are associated with
a low prevalence of hypertension or high blood pressure and with a low or no increase of blood pressure with age.
(2) 

Significance of sodium in relation to high blood pressure. 

(i) High blood pressure is a public health concern primarily because it is a major risk factor for mortality from coronary
heart disease and stroke. Early management of high blood pressure is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing
mortality associated with coronary heart disease and stroke. There is a continuum of mortality risk that increases
as blood pressures rise. Individuals with high blood pressure are at greatest risk, and individuals with moderately
high, high normal, and normal blood pressure are at steadily decreasing risk. The scientific evidence indicates
that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all hypertensive individuals.
There is also evidence that reducing sodium intake lowers blood pressure and associated risks in many but not all normotensive
individuals as well.
(ii) The populations at greatest risk for high blood pressure, and those most likely to benefit from sodium reduction,
include those with family histories of high blood pressure, the elderly, males because they develop hypertension
earlier in life than females, and black males and females. Although some population groups are at greater risk than
others, high blood pressure is a disease of public health concern for all population groups. Sodium intake, alcohol
consumption, and obesity are identified risk factors for high blood pressure.
(iii) Sodium intakes exceed recommended levels in almost every group in the United States. One of the major public
health recommendations relative to high blood pressure is to decrease consumption of salt. On a population-wide
basis, reducing the average sodium intake would have a small but significant effect on reducing the average blood
pressure, and, consequently, reducing mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke.
(iv) Sodium is an essential nutrient, and experts have recommended a safe minimum level of 500 mg sodium per day and
an upper level of 2,400 mg sodium per day, which is the Daily Reference Value for sodium.

Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease_

(1) 

Relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease. 

(i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease.


(i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for
more deaths than any other disease or group of diseases. Early management of risk factors for coronary heart disease
is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality
risk from coronary heart disease that increases with increasing levels of blood LDL-cholesterol. Individuals with
high blood LDL-cholesterol are at greatest risk. A larger number of individuals with more moderately elevated cholesterol
also have increased risk of coronary events; such individuals comprise a substantial proportion of the adult U.S.
population. The scientific evidence indicates that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intakes lowers blood
LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals. There is also evidence that reducing saturated fat
and cholesterol intakes in persons with blood cholesterol levels in the normal range also reduces risk of heart disease.

(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. 
(3) 

Requirements. 

(i) All requirements set forth in 
 381.414 shall be met. 
(ii) 

Specific requirements_

(A) 

Nature of the claim. 

A health claim associating diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol with reduced risk of coronary heart disease

(

3

) In specifying the nutrient, the claim uses the terms ``saturated fat'' and ``cholesterol'' and lists both; 
(

4

) The claim does not attribute any degree of coronary heart disease risk reduction to diets low in saturated fat and

which there is general scientific agreement that they are major risk factors for this disease: A family history of
coronary heart disease, elevated blood total- and LDL-cholesterol, excess body weight, high blood pressure, cigarette
smoking, diabetes, and physical inactivity. 
(ii) The claim may indicate that the relationship of saturated fat and cholesterol to heart disease is through the
intermediate link of ``blood cholesterol'' or ``blood total- and LDL-cholesterol.'' 
(iii) The claim may include information from paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section, which summarizes the relationship
between dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease and the significance of the relationship.

(iv) In specifying the nutrient, the claim may include the term ``total fat'' in addition to the terms ``saturated
fat'' and ``cholesterol.'' 
(v) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans.''

state that individuals with high blood cholesterol should consult their physicians for medical advice and treatment.


(5) 

Model health claims. 

The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to describe the relationship between dietary saturated
fat and cholesterol and risk of heart disease: 
(i) While many factors affect heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of this
disease. 
(ii) Development of heart disease depends upon many factors, but its risk may be reduced by diets low in saturated fat
and cholesterol and healthy lifestyles. 
(iii) Development of heart disease depends on many factors, including a family history of the disease, high blood
LDL-cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight, cigarette smoking, lack of exercise, and the
type of dietary pattern. A healthful diet low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, as part of a healthy lifestyle,
may lower blood cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease. 
(iv) Many factors, such as family history of the disease, increased blood total- and LDL-cholesterol levels, high
blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and being overweight, contribute to developing heart disease. Eating
a diet low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may help reduce the risk of heart disease. 
(v) Diets low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat may reduce the risk of heart disease. Heart disease is dependent
upon many factors, including diet, a family history of the disease, elevated blood LDL-cholesterol levels, and physical
inactivity.

Fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer_

(1) 

Relationship between diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer
risk. 

(i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors. 
(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products, fruits,
and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of some types of cancer. Although the specific role of total dietary
fiber, fiber components, and the multiple nutrients and other substances contained in these foods are not fully understood,
many studies have shown that diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing foods are associated with reduced risk of
some types of cancer. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables and risk of cancer. 

(i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
direct health care costs and losses due to morbidity and mortality, are very high. 
(ii) U.S. diets tend to be high in fat and low in grain products, fruits, and vegetables. Studies in various parts of
the world indicate that populations who habitually consume a diet high in plant foods have lower risks of some cancers.
These diets are generally low in fat and rich in many nutrients, including, but not limited to, dietary fiber. Current
dietary guidelines from the Federal Government and nationally recognized health professional organizations recommend
decreased consumption of fats (less than 30 percent of calories), maintenance of desirable body weight, and increased
consumption of fruits and vegetables (five or more servings daily), and grain products (six or more servings daily).

(3) 

Requirements. 

(i) All requirements set forth in 
 381.414 shall be met. 
(ii) Specific Requirements. (A)

(f) 

Fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary
heart disease

_(1) 

Relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products
that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease

. (i) Cardiovascular disease means diseases of the heart and circulatory system. Coronary heart disease is the most
common and serious form of cardiovascular disease and refers to diseases of the heart muscle and supporting blood
vessels. High blood total- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels are major modifiable risk factors
in the development of coronary heart disease. High coronary heart disease rates occur among people with high blood
cholesterol levels of 240 mg per decaliter (mg/dL) (6.21 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above and LDL-cholesterol
levels of 160 mg/dL (4.13 mmol/L) or above. Borderline high risk blood cholesterol levels range from 200 to 239 mg/dL
(5.17 to 6.18 mmol/L) and 130 to 159 mg/dL (3.36 to 4.11 mmol/L) of LDL-cholesterol. Dietary lipids (fats) include
fatty acids and cholesterol. Total fat, commonly referred to as fat, is composed of saturated fat (fatty acids containing
no double bonds), and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat (fatty acids containing one or more double bonds).

(ii) The scientific evidence establishes that diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with increased
levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus, with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Diets low in
saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with decreased levels of blood total- and LDL-cholesterol and, thus,
with decreased risk of developing coronary heart disease. 
(iii) Populations with relatively low blood cholesterol levels tend to have dietary patterns that are not only low
in total fat, especially saturated fat and cholesterol, but are also relatively high in fruits, vegetables, and grain
products. Although the specific roles of these plant foods are not yet fully understood, many studies have shown that
diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease. These studies correlate diets
rich in fruits, vegetables, and grain products and nutrients from these diets, such as some types of fiber, with reduced
coronary heart disease risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of dietary fiber, particularly
soluble fiber. Currently, there is not scientific agreement as to whether a particular type of soluble fiber is beneficial,
or whether the observed protective effects of fruits, vegetables, and grain products against heart disease are due
to other components, or a combination of components, in these diets, including, but not necessarily limited to, some
types of soluble fiber, other fiber components, other characteristics of the complex carbohydrate content of these
foods, other nutrients in these foods, or displacement of saturated fat and cholesterol from the diet. 
(2) 

Significance of the relationship between diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables,
and grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber, and risk of coronary heart disease

. (i) Coronary heart disease is a major public health concern in the United States, primarily because it accounts for

is a major public health goal that can assist in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. There is a continuum of mortality

LDL-cholesterol and risk of heart disease in most individuals, including persons with blood cholesterol levels
in the normal range. Additionally, consuming diets high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products, foods that contain
soluble fiber, may be a useful adjunct to a low saturated fat and low cholesterol diet.

(ii) Other risk factors for coronary heart disease include a family history of heart disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of regular physical exercise. 
(iii) Intakes of saturated fat exceed recommended levels in many people in the United States. Intakes of cholesterol
are, on average, at or above recommended levels. Intakes of fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products
are about half of recommended intake levels. One of the major public health recommendations relative to coronary
heart disease risk is to consume less than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, and an average of 30 percent or
less of total calories from all fat. Recommended daily cholesterol intakes are 300 mg or less. Recommended total dietary
fiber intakes are about 25 g daily, of which about 25 percent (about 6 g) should be soluble fiber. 
(iv) Current dietary guidance recommendations encourage decreased consumption of dietary fat, especially saturated
fat and cholesterol, and increased consumption of fiber-rich foods to help lower blood LDL-cholesterol levels.
Results of numerous studies have shown that fiber-containing fruits, vegetables, and grain products can help lower
blood LDL-cholesterol.

Fruits and vegetables and cancer

_(1) 

Relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer risk.

 (i) Cancer is a constellation of more than 100 different diseases, each characterized by the uncontrolled growth
and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer has many causes and stages in its development. Both genetic and environmental
risk factors may affect the risk of cancer. Risk factors include a family history of a specific type of cancer, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, overweight and obesity, ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, exposure to cancer-causing
chemicals, and dietary factors.

(ii) Although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances in plant foods are not yet understood,
many studies have shown that diets high in plant foods are associated with reduced risk of some types of cancers. These
studies correlate diets rich in fruits and vegetables and nutrients from these diets, such as vitamin C, vitamin A,
and dietary fiber, with reduced cancer risk. Persons consuming these diets frequently have high intakes of these
nutrients. Currently there is not scientific agreement as to whether the observed protective effects of fruits and
vegetables against cancer are due to a combination of the nutrient components of diets rich in fruits and vegetables,
including but not necessarily limited to dietary fiber, vitamin A as 

beta

-carotene, and vitamin C, to displacement of fat from such diets, or to intakes of other substances in these foods which
are not nutrients but may be protective against cancer risk.

(2) 

Significance of the relationship between consumption of diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and risk
of cancer.

 (i) Cancer is ranked as a leading cause of death in the United States. The overall economic costs of cancer, including
