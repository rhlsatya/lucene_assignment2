<USBUREAU>Department of the Navy</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Construction and Operation of a Relocatable Over
the Horizon Radar, PR</DOCTITLE>




Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Public Law Number Nine, Section
4(c), the Department of Navy, in coordination with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, announces its intent to prepare
an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the potential environmental effects of constructing and operating
a Relocatable Over the Horizon Radar (ROTHR) system, Puerto Rico.

The ROTHR is a land-based, wide area surveillance, high frequency (HF), radar system, which permits detection and
tracking of aircraft, and supports requirements for the early detection and monitoring of illegal drug activity.
The installation of the ROTHR in Puerto Rico is proposed as an addition to the national and local counter-narcotic
strategy by focusing detection and enforcement efforts at their sources. It will complement ROTHR systems in Virginia
and Texas and other surveillance installations to provide virtually complete coverage of the Caribbean Basin and
the northern portion of South America.

The ROTHR system has three components; Transmitter, Receiver, and an Operation Control Center. The proposed action
would locate a Transmitter on Vieques Island and a Receiver in southwestern Puerto Rico. The Operation Control Center
functions will be performed at a currently existing facility in Norfolk, Virginia. The Transmitter will require
approximately 100 acres of land, and will consist of 34 metal, vertical antenna towers and 34 wooden, vertical poles,
supporting a curtain of antenna wires. Towers would range in height from 71 feet to 125 feet. The Receiver will require
approximately 200 acres of land, and will consist of 372 pairs of aluminum, monopole antennas, each about 17 feet high
and extending approximately 8,600 linear feet.

Alternatives for both the Transmitter and Receiver sites, including the no action alternative, will be addressed
in the EIS. Three Transmitter site alternatives are located on Navy property on Vieques Island, two in the Camp Garcia
area and one north of Playa Grande. No preferred alternative for the Transmitter site has been identified. A preferred
alternative for the Receiver site is located on private property in the Valle de Lajas, northwest of the Ensenada Community,
Guanica and southeast of the town of Lajas. The Puerto Rico Industrial Development Corporation (PRIDCO) would obtain
individual leases from property owners and assemble these as one lease to the Navy. Alternative Receiver sites, another
in the Valle de Lajas and a site east of the city of Salinas, have also been identified.
Major environmental issues identified to be addressed in the EIS include wetlands, threatened and endangered species,
floodplains, historic and pre-historic cultural resources, soil erosion, aesthetics, and electromagnetic effects.
The Draft EIS is planned to be available to the public in early 1995.

The Department of the Navy will hold two public scoping meetings to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity
to identify significant issues related to the proposed action. Scoping meetings will be held as follows:

 June 9, 1994 from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. at the Community Center (main street next to public library), La Parguera,
PR.

 June 11, 1994 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the Municipal Assembly Hall, Vieques, PR.


Following a brief overview of the proposed action (presented in both English and Spanish at each scoping meeting),
comments will be heard. Each attendee will be requested to indicate, when registering, whether he/she intends to
deliver oral comments at the meeting. Comments may be made in either English or Spanish and will be translated sequentially
in summary form. In the interest of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to five minutes.
All interested federal, Commonwealth, and local agencies, and interested persons are invited and encouraged to
attend one or both of these meetings to submit comments in writing as described below.


Written statements and/or questions regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Commander, Atlantic Division,
Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Norfolk, Virginia 23511-6287, Attn: Ms. Linda Blount (Code 2032LB),
telephone (804) 445-2304. Questions may also be directed to Mr. Jose Negron, (809) 865-4429, or CDR Lou
Marchett, (809 865-4152, at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, or to LCDR Michael McCloskey at Commander, Forces
Air Caribbean (809) 723-9844. All comments must be received no later than June 30, 1994, to ensure consideration
in preparation of the EIS.

Waste Acceptance Issues 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of inquiry.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy seeks to address the concerns of affected parties regarding the continued storage of spent
nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. Through this Notice of Inquiry, the Department desires to elicit the views
of affected parties on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept
spent nuclear fuel in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or a suitable storage facility constructed
under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended; (2) the need for an interim, away-from-reactor storage facility
prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion
of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites
beyond 1998. While seeking these comments, the Department remains committed to pursuing the permanent disposal
of spent nuclear fuel and developing a strategy to address its interim storage.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



A. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 



The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, [Act], 42 U.S.C. 10101 

et seq

., provides a comprehensive framework for disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste. Section 302 of the Act established the Nuclear Waste Fund and required owners and generators of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level waste to pay fees into the Nuclear Waste Fund sufficient to ensure the full-cost recovery of all
program expenditures. Section 302(a) authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with the owners and generators
of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste of domestic origin [herein referred to as ``utility''] for the acceptance
and disposal of such wastes. Section 302(a)(5) of the Act further stipulated that these contracts shall provide that
the Secretary shall take title to the spent nuclear fuel or high-level waste as expeditiously as practicable following
commencement of operation of a repository and that, in return for payment of the fees established by this section,
the Secretary, beginning not later than January 31, 1998, will dispose of these wastes. 



B. Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste 



The Department implemented Section 302(a) of the Act through rulemaking under which it promulgated the Standard
Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) (48 FR 16590,
codified at 10 CFR part 961), which was published on April 18, 1983. Article II of the Standard Contract states that
``the services to be provided by DOE [Department of Energy] under this contract shall begin, after commencement of
facility operations, not later than January 31, 1998 * * *''. The use of the term ``facility'' in the
Standard Contract, as contrasted with the use of the term ``repository'' in the Act, was in recognition that a Monitored
Retrievable Storage (MRS) facility may be available before a repository and could meet the intent of the statute.

C. Development of a Repository and a MRS 



When the Act was passed, the Department anticipated that a geologic repository would be in operation and prepared
to begin acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. As indicated above, when the Standard Contract was promulgated,
the Department envisioned that it would have a waste management facility in operation and would be prepared to begin
acceptance of spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. 

The Act provides for a comprehensive site selection and site characterization process, wherein the Department makes
a recommendation to the President for approval of a repository. Currently, the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada is the
only site authorized by the Congress for site characterization. Should Yucca Mountain prove scientifically suitable,
and be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and approved by the Congress, the Department currently projects
that the earliest possible date for acceptance of waste for disposal at a repository is 2010. 

With respect to availability of an MRS to accept and temporarily store spent nuclear fuel, the Nuclear Waste Policy
Amendments Act of 1987 (Amendments Act) linked the development schedule for an MRS facility to the geologic repository.
The Amendments Act precludes the Department from selecting an MRS site until a repository site is recommended to the
President, and MRS construction may not be started until a construction authorization for a repository is received
from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Given these timing restrictions, the Department has looked to the negotiated
siting process, administered by the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, and a negotiated agreement proposing a site to the
Congress as the appropriate mechanism for achieving the 1998 waste acceptance target. Experience has shown that
there are significant challenges associated with siting any facility of this type. Thus far, neither the efforts
of the Department nor any other organization, including the Office of the Nuclear Waste Negotiator, have achieved
the level of success needed to realize significant progress in locating and developing a site by 1998. 

In an April 1, 1993, letter to the Secretary of Energy, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners
(NARUC) proposed that a collaborative dialogue be initiated to identify and develop constructive recommendations
for the Secretary and others for their consideration in evaluating alternatives for interim spent nuclear fuel storage.
In order to establish a dialogue whose participants represented a broad range of affected interests, NARUC extended
invitations to state utility regulators, nuclear utility executives, environmental groups, and representatives
from the State of Nevada. Individuals from the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission were invited
to provide technical assistance. 

Over the course of three meetings, the participants identified alternatives for interim storage of spent nuclear
fuel, and considered the advantages and disadvantages of each. On February 25, 1994, NARUC issued the Report and Recommendations
of the NARUC Dialogue on Spent Fuel Management, presenting the results of this stakeholder dialogue. In summary,
the majority findings of the NARUC dialogue were that:


 

Centralized off-site interim storage of spent fuel is far preferable to on-site storage at reactor sites throughout
the country. The federal government should take immediate action to establish centralized interim storage capability
by 1998, including the commencement of an effort to develop such capability at one or more federal sites. This represents
a sensible, safe, economic approach to meeting the nation's near term spent fuel management needs. The participants
recognize that Congressional action is necessary to effectuate many of the recommendations. They also recognize
that this is a difficult issue and are ready to actively assist the federal government in discharging its responsibilities.



D. The Department's Waste Acceptance Obligation 



Many utilities have maintained that certain terms in the Act and the Standard Contract created an unconditional obligation
on behalf of the Department to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. Some of these utilities have informed the
Department that they have implemented long term waste management plans based on this interpretation. 

The Department's preliminary view is that it has no statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel beginning in
1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act, although the Department
in implementing the Standard Contract may have created an expectation that it would begin accepting such spent nuclear
fuel in 1998. Accordingly, the Secretary has indicated her intent to explore with affected parties various options
and methods for sharing the costs related to the financial burden associated with continued on-site storage. Any
form of cost sharing offered through the Nuclear Waste Fund is not intended to fulfill the Department's ultimate obligation
under the Standard Contract to take title to and physical possession of spent nuclear fuel once a facility constructed
under the Act is operational. 



E. Purpose of Notice 



This Notice of Inquiry is intended to implement the Secretary's initiative by eliciting the views of affected parties
on: (1) The Department's preliminary view that it does not have a statutory obligation to accept spent nuclear fuel
in 1998 in the absence of an operational repository or other facility constructed under the Act; (2) the need for an
interim, away-from-reactor storage facility prior to repository operations; and (3) options for offsetting, through
the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund, a portion of the financial burden that may be incurred by utilities in continuing
to store spent nuclear fuel at reactor sites beyond 1998. 

Should the Department proceed with some form of cost sharing, each utility would be offered an opportunity to modify
its Standard Contract. As a condition of such cost sharing, it is possible that the Department may require a release,
in whole or in part, of potential contractual liability arising out of any obligation to accept waste prior to commencement
of repository operation or the operation of another facility constructed under the Act. 

The Department recognizes that there are a number of potential forms of cost sharing arrangements, but at this time,
the Department has not reached a decision whether to proceed with, nor is it predisposed to, any particular form of
cost sharing. Currently, the Department is evaluating a design for multi-purpose canisters (MPC) to support spent
nuclear fuel transportation, storage, and disposal. The MPC offers the potential for considerable standardization,
simplification and, consequently, cost savings for both utilities and the Federal waste management system. Given
the potential benefits of the MPC, the Secretary has directed that the options to be explored by the Department should
include, to the maximum extent possible, the provision and use of MPCs to address both schedule and cost concerns arising
from the potential unavailability of a repository or an MRS in 1998. 



II. Requests for Submissions 



The Department requests written comments from all affected parties. All written information provided by respondents
will be available for public inspection at the Department of Energy, Freedom of Information Reading Room, room 1E-190,
1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
except Federal holidays. Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information believed
to be proprietary or confidential and exempt by law from public disclosure should submit two copies of the document;
1 complete copy and 1 copy in which information believed to be proprietary or confidential has been deleted, and the
reasons you believe the information is not subject to disclosure. Information identified as proprietary or confidential
will be handled in accordance with governing Departmental regulations. Specific areas for comment are identified
below; however, this delineation of issues is not intended to limit the content of submissions. 



Legal Issue 



 Does the Department have a legal obligation under the Act or the Standard Contract to accept waste in 1998 in
the absence of a repository or other facility under the Act? If so, should the Department seek a release, in whole or
in part, of any liability arising out of such obligation as a condition of cost sharing? 



Interim Storage Issues 


 Does there continue to be a need for a Federal or centralized interim storage facility prior to repository operations?

 Should the development of an interim spent nuclear fuel storage facility at an existing Federal site be pursued?

 What role, if any, should the Department play in the development of private interim storage facilities? 
 If the Department is successful in making available central interim storage for spent nuclear fuel, should
each utility have the option to pursue continued storage on-site or elsewhere? 
 Should the Department pursue with Congress the elimination of the existing restrictions on MRS siting, construction,
and operations? 
 What additional comments do you have on the NARUC dialogue? (Copies of their Report are available in the Department
of Energy's, Freedom of Information Reading Room, room 1E-190, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington,
DC 20585 between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.) 


Cost Sharing Issues 


 Recognizing the full-cost recovery provision and the limitations imposed on the use of the Nuclear Waste Fund
by Section 302 of the Act, should the Department consider offering some form of cost sharing to utilities if it is unable
to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998? 
 What basis should the Department use for establishing the order and timing by which such cost sharing is offered?

 If it is found that such cost sharing may result in increased fees, should the Department continue pursuing
implementation of a cost-sharing program? 
 If cost sharing involves the Department providing MPCs and the utilities paying the costs associated with
storage modules and other on-site storage related needs (e.g., costs of loading and handling operations), would
the extent of utility expenditures required by this approach affect whether utilities would use it? 
 If the primary emphasis of a cost-sharing program were to be the provision of MPCs by the Department, what should
be done for utilities unable (e.g., those sites that are physically constrained from utilizing MPCs) or unwilling
to make use of MPCs? 
 What other forms of cost sharing should the Department consider?

<DOCTITLE>Simazine; Cancellation of the Registration of Aladdin Winter Care for Non-Payment of Registration Maintenance
Fees </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Cancellation Order. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this Notice, issued pursuant to section 4(i)(5)(D) of FIFRA, EPA is cancelling the registration of Aladdin Winter
Care (EPA Reg. No. 11329-17) for failure to pay the annual registration maintenance fee for its product registration.
The effective date for this section 4(i) cancellation is May 25, 1994. Existing stocks of the product subject to the
cancellation order in this Notice may not be sold, distributed, or used effective May 25, 1994, except for (1) sale
or distribution up through the channels of trade to the former registrant of that product, or (2) lawful disposal.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Cancellation For Maintenance Fee Non-Payment 



This registration is being canceled for non-payment of maintenance fees. Section 4(i)(5)(A) of FIFRA requires each
registrant of a pesticide to pay an annual maintenance fee to keep its pesticide registrations in effect (7 U.S.C.
136a(5)(A)). On January 15, 1994, the fee was due for Aladdin Winter Care (EPA Reg. No. 11329-17, Aladdin Chemical
Company, registrant). However, EPA allowed registrants until April 1, 1994, to remit maintenance fees. The registrant
did not pay its registration maintenance fee by April 1. This Notice therefore serves as the final cancellation order
for Aladdin Winter Care, or any other product with EPA Reg. No. 11329-17. 



II. Risks Posed by Simazine in Swimming Pools 



Simazine, which is used primarily as an agricultural herbicide, is also used as an algaecide in swimming pools. The
swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a Group
C possible human carcinogen, and in August 1993 EPA conducted a risk assessment of simazine swimming pool algaecide
products. The risk assessment revealed unacceptable cancer and non-cancer health risks to children and adults exposed
to water treated with simazine algaecides. 
EPA's risk assessment is based on laboratory animal studies. These studies indicate that short-term exposure to
simazine may result in weight loss and reduced red blood cell count (anemia), which are reversible effects when exposure
is terminated. The studies also show that exposure to simazine poses a potential risk of cancer. 



III. Regulatory Background 


The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting the simazine
swimming pool use. None of Drexel Chemical's products are registered for aquatic use, and Ciba and Oxon-Italia ceased
supporting all aquatic uses prior to EPA's risk assessment. The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba, the supplier
of technical simazine for the swimming pool products, became effective on October 9, 1992. 
After EPA completed its assessment of the risks of simazine in swimming pools, EPA notified the registrants of the
22 simazine swimming pool algaecide products of the cancer and non-cancer risks associated with simazine swimming
pool use. In view of these risks, nine of the thirteen end-use registrants agreed to request voluntary cancellation
with no allowance for the formulation, sale, distribution, or use of existing product stocks. They also agreed to
waive the comment period typically associated with such requests for voluntary cancellation. Because the nine companies
voluntarily requested cancellation and asked for a waiver of the comment period, EPA ordered the voluntary cancellation
of these 14 registrations--along with maintenance fee non-payment cancellations of 3 registrations--to become
effective on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). Subsequently, Aladdin Chemical Company failed to pay the annual registration
maintenance fee for Aladdin Winter Care (EPA Reg. No. 11329-17). This registration fee non-payment is the subject
of this cancellation order. EPA is preparing cancellation actions against the registrations of the remaining 4 products,
which are held by Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Company. 


IV. Existing Stocks 


EPA has determined that because of the potential cancer and non-cancer health risks, no sale, distribution, or use
of existing stocks will be permitted, except as specified in this Notice. For purposes of this order, existing stocks
are defined as those stocks of Aladdin Winter Care, or any other product with EPA Reg. No. 11329-17, that were
in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994. 
EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362 (June 26, 1991)). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases, EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of a canceled product raising risk concerns
unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend this existing stocks
provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 
EPA has determined that it will not allow further distribution, sale, or use of existing stocks of any registered product
subject to this Notice by any person, except for (1) sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the
former registrant of that product, or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrant to
notify any and all supplementally registered distributors of their product(s) that this cancellation order also
applies to their supplementally registered products. Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by
their distributors. The swimming pool use of simazine poses unacceptable cancer and noncancer risks. Moreover,
information submitted to EPA does not demonstrate that the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing
stocks outweigh these risks. The benefits resulting from the use of existing stocks appear negligible, in that there
are more than 250 non-simazine algaecide products available for swimming pool use. According to EPA estimates, Aladdin
Winter Care's share of the swimming pool algaecide market is very small. Finally, EPA has taken steps that should have
reduced the amount of Aladdin Winter Care stocks currently in the hands of registrants, retailers, and distributors.
In December 1993, EPA notified registrants--including Aladdin Chemical Company--of the risks associated with
the products and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products. 
As a result of the cancellation order and existing stocks determination, a product subject to this Notice may only
be sold or distributed if it is both: (1) packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994, and (2)
sold or distributed (a) up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of the product, or (b) for lawful
disposal. 



V. Registration Subject to Cancellation Order 


This cancellation order applies to Aladdin Winter Care, or any other product with EPA Reg. No. 11329-17. 



VI. Cancellation Order 


I approve the cancellation of the above product, as well as the determination that from the date of this Notice, all
sale, distribution, and use of the existing stocks of this product is prohibited. Accordingly, this cancellation
order shall become effective May 25, 1994. Effective May 25, 1994, a product subject to this Notice may only be sold
or distributed if it is both: (1) packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to May 25, 1994, and (2) sold or
distributed (a) up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of the product, or (b) for lawful disposal.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (hereafter
referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 180,000 acres of cotton in Alabama. In accordance
with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at his discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if he determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW)
on up to 180,000 acres of cotton in Alabama. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this
request.



According to the Applicant, BAW is a devastating pest of cotton which has caused excessive economic damage in certain
areas of Alabama every year since 1984. In 1993, BAW infested approximately 75 percent of the cotton acreage and caused
significant economic damage to 25 percent of Alabama's cotton crop. Although naturally occurring parasites and
predators of BAW will control this pest, phosphate insecticides which are applied to control another pest of cotton,
the boll weevil, reduce parasite and predator populations and disrupt the natural biological control of BAW, making
the use of pesticides necessary for control. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only
partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use, the Applicant claims that yield losses of up
to 25 percent may occur, resulting in economic losses of between $11 million and $58 million statewide.

Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 52,000 pounds of product would be needed to treat up to 180,000 acres of cotton.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active
ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during
the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Alabama Department of
Agriculture and Industries.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (hereafter
referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 350,000 acres of cotton in Mississippi. In accordance
with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at his discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if he determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW)
on up to 350,000 acres of cotton in Mississippi. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part
of this request.



According to the Applicant, BAW is an occasional or sporadic pest of cotton in Mississippi. Recent outbreaks occurred
in 1988 and 1993, causing statewide losses of 1.6 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. Although naturally occurring
parasites and predators of BAW will control this pest, phosphate insecticides which are applied to control another
pest of cotton, the boll weevil, reduce parasite and predator populations and disrupt the natural biological control
of BAW, making the use of pesticides necessary for control. According to the Applicant, the registered pesticides
provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available for use, the Applicant claims that yield
losses of up to 25 percent may occur, resulting in economic losses of between $60 million and $216 million statewide.

Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 140,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 350,000 acres of cotton.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the

<DOCTITLE>Medicare Program; Methodology for Calculating the Interest Rate To Be Applied to Medigap Premium Refunds and Credits
</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the methodology that may be used by Medicare supplemental insurance policy (``Medigap'')
issuers to calculate the interest to be paid on premium credits and refunds due to Medicare beneficiaries. The Social
Security Act requires the insurers annually to issue refunds or credits when their loss ratios do not meet statutory
minimums and to pay interest from the end of the calendar year involved until the refund is made or the credit is applied.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



Under the Medicare program, Medicare pays for certain services furnished to beneficiaries entitled to Medicare.
The beneficiary is, however, responsible for certain deductibles, coinsurance amounts, and charges, subject to
certain limits, that exceed the amount allowed by Medicare. The beneficiary is also responsible for charges for items
and services not covered by Medicare. He or she may purchase additional private insurance to help pay the costs. 

One type of private insurance beneficiaries may purchase is a Medicare supplemental policy, known as a Medigap policy.
These policies typically offer coverage of some or all of Medicare's deductible and coinsurance amounts and sometimes
include coverage of services not covered under Medicare. Section 1882 of the Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth
Federal standards applicable to Medigap policies.

Under section 1882, no Medigap policy (as defined in section 1882(g)(1) of the Act) may be issued in a State unless it
complies with State laws that have been established in accordance with section 1882(b)(1) and have been approved
by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). (While Federal certification under section 1882(c) would be
necessary in the absence of an approved State program, all States currently have approved programs.) 

Among other requirements, section 1882(b)(1)(B) of the Act incorporates by reference the loss ratio provisions
of section 1882(r). Under section 1882(r)(1), a Medigap policy may not be issued or sold in any State unless it can be
expected to return a minimum level of benefits, calculated as a percentage of premiums. Under section 1882(r)(1)(B),
the issuer of the policy must provide for a proportional refund, or a credit against future premiums, if necessary
to assure to that loss ratio targets are met. Section 1882(r)(2)(C) requires that the refund or credit include interest
from the end of the policy year involved, at a rate specified by the Secretary that is not less than the average rate of
interest for 13-week Treasury notes. 

Section 13.B of the Model Regulation to Implement the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Medicare
Supplement Insurance Minimum Standards Model Act, adopted by the NAIC on July 30, 1991, specifies how and when the
refund or credit calculation is to be done. The Model interprets ``policy year'' to mean ``calendar year.'' Appendix
A of the Model contains the reporting form that is to be used by issuers in reporting their loss ratio experience to the
State. This form must be submitted by May 31 of each year. The form requires that a description of the refund and/or credit
against premiums to be used be attached to the form. In order to describe the refund or credit, the insurer must know
how to calculate the interest rate. 



II. Provisions of the Notice 



There are several possible methods for calculating the interest rate. We expect to specify a single methodology that
will be applicable for future years in the context of formal rulemaking relating to section 1882 generally. However,
it is not possible to conclude that process in time for insurers to meet the May 31, 1994 deadline. The purpose of this
notice is to meet the needs of States that are requiring refunds and premium credits this year. 

Until we specify otherwise, States may choose any reasonable methodology, subject to our approval. However, we have
determined that the methodology described below is an acceptable way to calculate the interest rate required by section
1882(r)(2)(C). If the State chooses this approach, no further approval is necessary. 

We have determined that it is reasonable to apply the same methodology that is used by HCFA when States have been overpaid
under the Medicaid program (title XIX of the Social Security Act). Under 42 CFR 433.38(d)(2), State repayments are
subject to interest charges at the rate HCFA determines to be the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day
Treasury bill auction rates during the period for which interest will be charged. (See 47 FR 29275; July 6, 1982). We
will find it acceptable if States apply the same methodology we use to implement this section. Specifically, we use
the unweighted average of the weekly auction average (investment) rates as published by the Federal Reserve. The
rates are applied as simple interest for the entire application period measured in days, assuming a 365-day calendar
year. The following table shows the rates for 1994 through the week ending April 22; however, any insurer can obtain
the rates independently from the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, which is made available each Monday. Information
on the availability of the release is available by telephoning (202) 452-3206. 





The insurer will be liable for the average rate from January 1 until the refund date, payable at simple interest (i.e.,
the number of days between January 1 and the refund date, divided by 365 and multiplied by the average rate.) 



III. Collection of Information Requirements 



This document does not impose information collection and recordkeeping requirements. Consequently, it need not
be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
3501 et seq.).

<DOCTITLE>National Cancer Institute: Opportunity for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the Identification
of Biomolecules Involved in HIV Entry Into Cells and Metastatic Tumor Cell Invasion</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Institutes of Health, PHS, DHHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks an agreement with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for the joint
research, development, evaluation and possible commercialization of biomolecules involved in HIV entry into cells
and metastatic tumor cell invasion. Elucidation of such components will lead to the design of reagents which will
interfere with HIV entry and/or tumor invasion. These reagents will subsequently be tested on animal models and in
eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Specific fusion of biological membranes is a central requirement for many cellular processes. It involves phenomena
such as intracellular sorting and secretion, cell division, fertilization, metastasis and viral entry into cells.
The research goals of the Membrane Structure and Function Section of the Laboratory of Mathematical Biology (LMMB);
Division of Cancer Biology; Diagnosis and Centers (DCBDC); National Cancer Institute (Dr. Robert Blumenthal, Chief)
have in the past years been directed towards an understanding how viral envelope proteins mediate fusion of membranes.
Dr. Blumenthal's group has developed new methodologies to examine the fusion activity of viral proteins.


The goal of this CRADA is to identify the biochemical components of the fusion complex involved in HIV entry into cells
and tumor cell invasion. A photosensitized labeling approach will be employed for the identification of membrane
fusion and cell adhesion molecules which may play an important role in HIV entry into cells and/or in metastatic cell
invasion. The use of the photosensitized labeling approach may make it possible to reveal the biological components
and proteins on cell surfaces (membranes) which could not previously be identified in any other way. Background information
(including reprints) is available from the above-referenced address. Selected peptide components of the fusion
complex will be purified and micro-sequenced in order to proceed with hybridization cloning of the accessary fusion
molecules. Reagents such as peptides and antibodies will then be generated using information derived from their
cDNA sequences. The reagents will be screened and tested for their ability to interfere with or block HIV infection
and/or metastatic cell invasion using in vitro assays. Potent inhibitors thus identified will be further tested
on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents.
(1) 

HIV: 

It has been shown that human CD4 inserted into non-human cells will not support HIV-1 entry into those cells.
Protease-insensitive components of human cells are needed to overcome the block in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated
fusion of non-human cells. The plan is to identify those putative components using a new technique called photosensitized
labeling. By this methodology, lipophilic aryl azides are photoactivated in situ by energy transfer from a variety
of chromophores, using visible light. This approach has been successfully applied to the identification of proteins
and lipids involved in multidrug resistance of tumor cells and the process of invasion of human erythrocytes by the
Malaria parasite. Peptides derived from specific regions of gp 120 and gp 41 are labeled with fluorescein or other
chromophores and photoactivated during their interaction with CD4

+

 membranes containing the radioactive probe [

125

I]-5-Iodonaphthalene-1-azide (INA). Since photoactivation occurs by resonance energy only, membrane components
in the vicinity of CD4 will be labeled by INA. The putative accessory proteins forming fusion complexes with gp 120
and CD4 will presumably be labeled, identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of such protease-insensitive
components will lead to the design of reagents which will interfere with or block HIV entry into cells. These reagents
will subsequently be tested on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents
against HIV infection.
(2) 

Metastasis: 

It has been shown that cytokine-induced pseudopodial protrusion is a prominent feature of actively motile cells
in vitro and invading tumor cells in vivo. Following protrusion of the pseudopodia through the basement membrane,
it has been postulated that fusion of adjacent pseudopods occurs. This is following by streaming of the cytoplasm
beneath the basement membranes, migration of the nucleus and finally, relocation of the cell to the opposite side
of the basement membrane. This process results in migration of the tumor cell towards the target tissue. The pseudopod
fusion process is presumably mediated by membrane fusion-inducing proteins which are transiently expressed during
cell migration across the basement membrane. For the identification of such proteins, a similar approach will be
used as that for identification of accessory components in HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane
fusion: the chromophore will be placed on one population of cells and the 

125

INA will be placed on another population of metastatic cell. Upon their penetration through basement membranes,
the pseudopodia of adjacent cells may fuse with one another. Fusion of a chromophore-labeled membrane with an 

125

INA-bearing membrane will cause energy transfer between the chromophore and INA generating a measurable signal
in the form of radiolabeled proteins located at the site of fusion. The membrane proteins involved in metastatic cell
fusion and invasion will be identified on 2D gels and isolated. The elucidation of these proteins will lead to the design
of reagents which will interfere with or block tumor invasion into cells. These reagents will subsequently be tested
on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents against tumor cell invasion.
CRADA aims include the rapid publication of research results and the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities.
The CRADA partner will enjoy rights of first negotiation for licensing Government rights to any inventions arising
under the agreement and will advance funds payable upon signing the CRADA to help defray Government expenses for patenting
such inventions and other CRADA-related costs.

The role of the Collaborator will be as follows:
1. The Collaborator will provide technology for the identification of membrane fusion and cell adhesion molecules.
In particular, the Collaborator should be able to provide technology for the implementation of photosensitized
labeling approach for identification of membrane fusion and cell adhesion molecules.
2. The Collaborator will be responsible for the purification and micro-sequencing of selected peptides, enabling
NCI to proceed with hybridization cloning of the accessary fusion molecules.
3. The Collaborator will generate reagents (e.g. peptides and antibodies) using information derived from their
cDNA sequences.
4. The Collaborator will provide technology which will allow the control and synchronization of migratory and invasive
processes of metastatic cells. This technology will be used to model invasion of metastatic cells in vivo.
5. The Collaborator will screen and test reagents (e.g. peptides and antibodies) for their ability to block HIV infection
and/or metastatic cell invasion using in vitro assays.
6. Potent inhibitors of HIV infection and/or metastatic cell invasion identified by screening will be further tested
by the Collaborator on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents.
The role of the Division of Cancer Biology Diagnosis and Centers, NCI, in this CRADA will be as follows:
1. Provide the Collaborator with techniques, expertise and facilities to study virus-cell interactions.
2. Provide computer and literature search support for the project.
3. Provide access to sophisticated instrumentation (e.g. fluorescence spectroscopy and video microscopy (imaging),
protein separation).
4. Characterize physicochemical properties of the biomolecules involved in the fusion process as well as researching
their mechanisms of biological action.
5. Publish these results and provide the Collaborator all data as soon as they become available.
The selection criteria on which in Collaborator will be chosen are as follows:
1. The ability to collaborate with NCI on further research and development of this technology as demonstrated by experience
and expertise in this or a related area of technology.
2. The demonstration of adequate resources to perform the research, development and commercialization of this technology
(i.e. facilities, personnel) and accomplish the objectives in a timely manner.
3. The willingness to commit best effort to reach CRADA objectives.
4. The level of financial support the collaborator will provide for CRADA-related NCI activities.
5. A willingness to cooperate with the National Cancer Institute in the publication of research results.
6. An agreement to be bound by the DHHS rules involving human subjects, patent rights and ethical treatment of animals.
7. Provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any invention. Generally, the rights of ownership are
retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with: (1) An irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license to the Government (when a company employee is the sole inventor) or (2) an exclusive or non-exclusive license
to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the Government employee is the sole inventor).

(Micro-FISH Probes) Developed by Dr. Paul Meltzer and Dr. Jeffrey Trent, National Center for Human Genome Research

 Notice.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health seeks non-exclusive biological materials licensees to commercialize Whole Chromosome
Painting Probes (WCP probes) and Region Specific Painting Probes (Micro-FISH probes) generated by chromosome microdissection
and amplification of specific regions, and labelled for Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH). The probes can
be hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes and used as either diagnostic reagents for identification of chromosomal
abnormalities or as research reagents to further study various cancers and hereditary diseases. 


WCP probes for all human chromosomes are being generated using a universal primer. The probes are significantly superior
to current probes due to greater sensitivity and selectivity. The subject invention allows generation of probes
for the acrocentric chromosomes (13,14,15,21 and 22) by elimination of shared ribosomal elements between these
chromosomes. 
While numerous whole chromosome painting probes are presently available, most have technical limitations. Most
frequently, hybridization to portions of the target chromosome is incomplete because of gaps in the sequence. Additionally,
in many cases flow-sorted chromosomes in rodent backgrounds invariably transfer some sequences which make these
unusable for research analysis with somatic cell hybrids. 
The WCP and Micro-FISH probes address these problems. The probes can be used to analyze complex chromosome rearrangements
in a variety of malignancies, clearly identifying chromosome rearrangements which could not be detected by conventional
banding analysis. The probes can also be generated to span translocation breakpoints and identify interstitial
deletions, both of which would confound conventionally created whole chromosome painting probes. 
Beyond improvements in specificity and sensitivity, probes created by the micro-FISH method eliminate the microchemical
steps required by other methods by using a DNA oligonucleotide primer to directly prime DNA synthesis at intervals
along the microdissected DNA template. Accordingly, the procedure for probe preparation is dramatically simplified
and accelerated, and since the major losses associated with the microchemical process are largely eliminated, the
probes emit a stronger and more uniform signal intensity than other commonly available probes. 
NIH is the assignee of the rights for this technology developed by Drs. Trent and Meltzer of the National Center for
Human Genome Research. The laboratory at the National Center for Human Genome Research will make dissected chromosomal
biological material available for probe manufacture, through a nonexclusive biological materials license agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Department of Justice Policy, 28 CFR 50.7 38 FR 19029, notice is hereby given that on May 5, 1994,
a Compliant was filed and a proposed Consent Decree was lodged with the United States District Court for the Western
District of Washington in 

United States 

v. 

Pacific Sound Resources, et al., 

Civil Action No. C94-687. The proposed Consent Decree settles claims asserted by the United States at the request
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for cleanup of releases of hazardous substances at the Wyckoff/Eagle
Harbor Superfund Site and the proposed Pacific Sound Resources Superfund Site, both in Seattle, Washington. The
Consent Decree also settles claims for natural resources damages at these two sites asserted by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Suquamish
Indian Tribe, and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe (the Natural Resource Trustees). The settling defendants include
Pacific Sound Resources, Inc. (PSR), which owns the sites and operates or formerly operated a wood treating facility
at each of them, a trust created to take ownership of the sites during cleanup, and officers and directors of PSR.

The Complaint assets claims under Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607. The Complaint seeks an order that the defendants implement remedial
actions selected by EPA at each site, that they reimburse all response and assessment costs incurred and to be incurred
by the plaintiffs, and that they pay damages for the injury to, destruction, and/or loss of use of natural resources
resulting from contamination at the sites.

Under the Consent Decree, all assets of PSR will be transferred to a trust to ensure that they will be sold at an appropriate
time and that all proceeds will be devoted to cleanup and restoration of the Sites. The assets of PSR include several
parcels of potentially valuable real estate. The amount that will be obtained towards cleanup and restoration costs
under this agreement will depend in part on market conditions as the properties are sold.

The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer
to 

United States 

v. 

Pacific Sound Resources, 

D.J. Ref. No. 90-7-1-525.

The proposed Consent Decree and exhibits may be examined at the Region 10 Office of EPA, 7th Floor Records Center, 1200
Sixth Avenue, Seattle, WA 9810. A copy of the Consent Decree and exhibits (if requested) may be obtained in person or
by mail from the Consent Decree Library, 1120 G Street, NW., 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 624-0892.
In requesting copies, please enclouse a check in the amount of $9.75 (without exhibits) or $29.25 (with exhibits)
(25 cents per page reproduction cost) payable to the ``Consent Decree Library.''

Novo Nordisk Bioindustrials, Inc. 401(k) Thrift Plan (the Plan) 
Located in Danbury, Connecticut; Proposed Exemption
 


[Application No. D-9661] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code shall not apply to (1) the proposed interest-free loan to the Plan (the Loan) by Novo Nordisk Bioindustrials,
Inc. (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, and (2) the Plan's potential repayment of the Loan
upon the receipt by the Plan of payments under Guaranteed Investment Contract No. GA-4607 (the GIC) issued by
Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company (MBL); provided the following conditions are satisfied: 

(A) No interest or expenses are paid by the Plan in connection with the proposed transaction; 

(B) The Loan is made to reimburse the Plan for amounts invested with MBL under the terms of the GIC;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(C) The Loan will be repaid only out of amounts paid to the Plan by MBL, its successors, or any other responsible third
parties; and 

(D) Repayment of the Loan is waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds GIC proceeds. 



Summary of Facts and Representations 
 

1. The Employer, a New York corporation with its corporate headquarters in Danbury, Connecticut, is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A/S, a Danish Corporation. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which includes a cash or deferred
arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code, and which provides for Employer matching contributions and additional
Employer discretionary profit sharing contributions. The Plan provides for participant direction with respect
to employee contributions and Employer matching contributions to the Plan. The Plan participants have the option
of investing in any of five investment funds: the GIC Fund, the First Union Managed Bond Portfolio, the First Union
Balanced Portfolio, The Diversified Equity Fund, and the Novo American Depository Receipt Fund. Participants have
the right to change their investments within and among the funds on a daily basis, except that participants may no longer
transfer amounts into or out of the GIC Fund to the extent that their account balance in that Fund is attributable to
the GIC issued by MBL. As of December 31, 1993, the Plan had approximately 225 participants and total assets of approximately
$5,600,000. The Plan's trustee is First Union Bank of North Carolina. 

2. The applicant represents that the GIC acquired from MBL was effective with respect to amounts deposited during
1987. The terms of the GIC provided for interest to be credited at the rate of 8.10% per annum until December 31, 1988,
and thereafter at the rate of 7.55% per annum until the maturity date of December 31, 1991. 

3. On July 16, 1991, MBL was placed into rehabilitation proceedings by the New Jersey Commissioner of Insurance. Consequently,
MBL has suspended payments on its guaranteed investment contracts, including the GIC held by the Plan. This situation
has prevented participants from exercising their rights under the Plan to request distributions, loans, and investment
transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC.

1

 As of December 31, 1991, the GIC had a total accumulated book value of $578,916.34.

2

 The Employer seeks an exemption to permit the Employer to make the Loan to the Plan in the amount due the Plan under the
GIC, plus interest through the date of the Loan. The Loan will be made pursuant to a written agreement between the Employer
and the Plan (the Agreement) incorporating the terms of the extension of credit and its repayment. The Employer represents
that it wishes to enter into the proposed transaction in order to protect the Plan participants from the effects of
a prolonged rehabilitation process and from any potential loss resulting from MBL's inability to meet its obligations
under the GIC. The Employer further represents that the Loan will enable the Plan to make timely payments under the
GIC and, therefore, enable the Plan participants to exercise their rights under the Plan to request distributions,
loans, and investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC. The Employer also represents
that the Loan will be non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur any expenses in connection with the proposed
transaction. 






4. The proposed Loan will be made in one lump-sum payment equal to the amounts deposited under the GIC, adjusted as follows:
(1) Interest is calculated at the guaranteed interest rate under the terms of the GIC until December 31, 1991, the maturity
date; and (2) the post-maturity interest rates will be calculated as follows:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 


It is represented that the proposed rate of interest for periods after the maturity date are the rates that would apply
to the GIC for those periods according to the proposed plan of rehabilitation set forth by the Superior Court of New
Jersey. Any proceeds paid from the GIC and received by the Plan on or before the Loan date will be subtracted from the
book value. 


5. Repayment of the Loan under the Agreement is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of MBL or its successor.
No other Plan assets will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the payments by or on behalf of MBL are not sufficient
to fully repay the Loan, the Agreement provides that the Employer will have no recourse against the Plan, or against
any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. 
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The Loan will enable the Plan to recover the total accumulated book value of the GIC as of the date
of maturity, plus interest thereafter; (2) The Plan will pay no interest nor incur any expenses with respect to the
Loan; (3) Repayment of the Loan will be restricted to payments made by or on behalf of MBL and no other Plan assets will
be involved; and (4) Repayment of the Loan will be waived to the extent the Plan recoups less from the payments by or on
behalf of MBL than the total amount of the Loan.

Hollingsworth & Vose Company Savings Plan (the Plan) 
Located in East Walpole, Massachusetts; Proposed Exemption 


[Application No. D-9677] 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August
10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the
sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through
(E) of the Code, shall not apply to the August 26, 1992 loan (the Loan) of $188,000 to the Plan by Hollingsworth &
Vose Company (H&V), provided the following conditions were satisfied: (a) No interest or expense was incurred
by the Plan with respect to the Loan; (b) the Loan enabled the Plan to effect the transfer of amounts held in participant
accounts to new investments made available under the Plan; (c) accounts transferred from the Plan's GIC Fund were
credited with amounts representing the allocable principal deposit in the GIC Fund plus accrued interest at the GIC
Fund rate; (d) accounts which remained invested in the GIC Fund continued to receive interest at the same rate; and
(e) repayment of the Loan was restricted to amounts held in or allocated to the GIC Fund, and no other plan assets were
used for that purpose. 
Effective Dates: If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption will be effective from August 26, 1992 through
November 10, 1992. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. H&V is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts engaged in the manufacture
of technical and industrial papers and nonwoven fabrics. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which contains a cash or
deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the Code. The Plan is administered by the Savings Plan Committee (the
Committee) of H&V. Under the Plan, participating employees make elective contributions pursuant to salary
reduction agreements. H&V makes matching contributions not in excess of 6% of the participant's compensation.
The Plan had approximately 47 participants who were affected by the subject transaction, and at the time of the transaction
had assets with an approximate aggregate fair market value of $2,767,369. The Plan currently has assets of approximately
$4,361,700. 
2. Contributions under the Plan are allocated to the accounts of individual participants (the Accounts). The Accounts
are invested at the direction of participants in one or more of the investment options available under the Plan. Investment
directions may be made or changed as of January 1 and July 1 of each Plan year and remain in effect until changed by the
participant. 
3. Prior to July, 1992, two investment funds were available to participants, the Guaranteed Investment Contract
Fund (the GIC Fund) and the Fidelity Equity Income Fund. The investments held in the GIC Fund at that time consisted
of four contracts: (i) Fidelity Group Trust, at 8.33%, maturing on March 31, 1993; (ii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust
II-90, at 8.17%, maturing March 31, 1993; (iii) Vanguard Fixed Rate GIC Trust II-91, at 7.45%, maturing
on March 31, 1994; and (iv) Principal Group Annuity Contract No. GA 4-3031, at 6.53%, maturing on March 31, 1995.
Participants who invested in the GIC Fund received interest at a combined rate calculated as the average of the rates
on open GICs held in the Fund, weighted in proportion to the amounts allocated to each such GIC. 
4. In September, 1991, the Committee began discussing the possibility of expanding investment options under the
Plan in order to give participants greater flexibility and diversity of choice among investments with respect to
appropriate levels of risk and return. On April 16, 1992, the Committee resolved to offer four investment options,
effective as of July 1, 1992. These were to be the GIC Fund, the Fidelity Equity Income Fund and two additional options,
the Fidelity Growth and Income Fund and the Value Line U.S. Government Securities Fund. Participants were informed
of the additional options by notice from the Committee on May 26, 1992. 
5. The Committee subsequently received and processed directions from participants for changes in investments as
of the July 1, 1992 change date. The new investment directions required the transfer of $258,572 held in the GIC Fund,
or approximately 10% of Plan assets, to other investment options. 
6. Because of restrictions under the GICs, however, the Plan was unable to redeem its interest in the contracts to effect
the transfer of amounts to other investments as directed by participants. Specifically, under the Principal Group
GIC, Principal could terminate the contract if withdrawals were made prior to the maturity date. H&V understood
that similar restrictions applied under the other GICs held in the GIC Fund (although in fact there were no comparable
restrictions on the Vanguard GICs). 
7. To enable participants whose Accounts were invested in the GIC Fund to make use of the new investment options and
to protect participants from incurring penalties for premature withdrawals from the GICs, the Committee resolved
to advance funds to the Plan. On August 26, 1992, $188,000 was wire transferred by H&V to the Plan. The $188,000
was invested in equity funds in accordance with the directions of those participants whose account balances in the
GIC Fund could not otherwise be transferred.

<TEXT>
 

8. Subsequent to the advance of funds, H&V was advised that the transaction might constitute a prohibited transaction
under section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. H&V therefore took immediate action in an attempt to put
the Plan in the position in which it would have been had the transaction not occurred. The Committee determined that
under the Vanguard GICs, funds could be transferred at that time without penalties to participants. Allocations
to the GIC Fund made by participants in September and October, 1992 were applied, together with a partial liquidation
principally of the Vanguard Fixed Rate Trust II-91, to repay to H&V the amount that had been advanced to the
Plan. Specifically, $163,548 was repaid to H&V on November 10, 1992, and $24,452 was retained by the Plan and used
as an offset for contributions which would have otherwise been made by H&V. 

9. Under the terms of the Plan, the amounts repaid to H&V would have been invested in the open GICs held in the GIC
Fund, had the Loan not been made. The money that was in the GIC Fund prior to the Loan remained in the GIC Fund because it
could not be transferred out without penalty. Thus, the subsequent allocations could be used to repay the Loan to H&V,
and the GIC Fund remained in the same position it would have been in had the Loan by H&V not been made. The entire effect
of the Loan and repayment to H&V was thus to provide liquidity to the GIC Fund in order to make transfers to other
investment funds as directed by participants. The transaction was corrected within 90 days. No interest or other
expense was paid by the Plan. Participants who did not transfer amounts from the GIC Fund as of the July 1, 1992 change
date continued to receive the same return on their investment in the Fund. Participants who later invested in the GIC
Fund received the same return they would have received if the subject transaction had not occurred. 

10. In summary, the applicant represents that the subject transaction satisfied the criteria contained in section
408(a) of the Act for the following reasons: (a) The Loan enabled the Plan to effect the transfer of amounts held in participant
Accounts without penalty to new investments made available under the Plan; (b) Accounts transferred from the GIC
Fund were credited with amounts representing the allocable principal deposit in the fund plus accrued interest at
the Fund rate; (c) Accounts which remained invested in the GIC Fund continued to receive interest at the same rate;
(d) no interest or other expense was incurred by the Plan with respect to the Loan; (e) the applicant undid the Loan as
soon as it realized that the Loan constituted a prohibited transaction, with repayment of the loan taking place within
90 days of the making of the Loan; and (f) repayment of the loan was restricted to amounts held in or allocated to the GIC
Fund, and no other Plan assets were used for that purpose.

Western Capital Investment Corporation 
Employees' Retirement Fund (the Plan) Located in Denver, 
CO ; Proposed Exemption



[Application No. D-9489] 



The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990.) If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of 
sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the cash sale by the Plan, on
December 27, 1990, of certain of its assets (the Assets) to Bank Western, a Federal Savings Bank (Bank Western), the
principal subsidiary of the Plan's former sponsor and a party in interest with respect to the Plan. 

The proposed exemption is conditioned on the following requirements: (1) The sale represented a one-time transaction
for cash; (2) the sales price for each Asset was based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent
appraisal; (3) the Plan did not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (4) CNB files a Form 5330
with the Internal Revenue Service (the Service) and pays any applicable excise taxes that may be due on any of the Assets
within 90 days of the publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein.

The applicant notes that while the Plan held the Mobile Home Loans, the Lorenzos and the Grubers were occasionally
delinquent. However, the applicant explains that, in all instances, the borrowers quickly corrected these delinquencies
and the loans were current at the time of the sale transaction described herein.

The Plan received total investment income of $14,423 in connection with its investment in the Mobile Home Loans. The
Plan also paid servicing fees to SAC with respect to the administration of the Mobile Home Loans. Such servicing fees
were based on the receipt of a flat 11 percent interest rate. Income received above that rate was retained by SAC. Through
December 31, 1988, the Plan recorded servicing fees of $1,571. Following this date, the reporting system was changed
and the only entries that appeared were recordings of net interest income received by the Plan. No other fees were paid
by the Plan in connection with this investment.

On March 5, 1987, the Plan purchased 20 residential mortgage loans from an unrelated party, Capitol Federal Savings
of Denver, Colorado (Capitol Federal), for an aggregate cost of $1,003,958. Each of the Residential Mortgage Loans
bore interest at the rate of 9.25 percent and had maturities of 360 months. The collateral for the Residential Mortgage
Loans was a first lien on residential property. None of the borrowers were parties in interest. Although occasional
delinquencies occurred with respect to the Residential Mortgage Loans, none ever went into foreclosure. In addition,
there were no restrictions placed on the Plan's sale or transfer of these loans. 

Capitol Federal serviced the Residential Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Plan for a total servicing fee of $11,090.
The total income received by the Plan with respect to this investment was $265,837.

The Plan acquired the Whole Loans in four blocks for an aggregate purchase price of $2,089,978. The Plan earned $1,488,791
in income with respect to this investment and it paid total servicing fees of $122,290. The loans underlying the Whole
Loan Blocks represented first lien interests on residential property and had coupon rates ranging from 6.375 percent
to 
9 percent. None of the individual borrowers was a party in interest with respect to the Plan. No delinquencies, other
than occasional late payments, were ever documented with respect to the Whole Loans. Further, no restrictions were
ever placed on the sale of transfer of this investment. 
(1) 

Whole Loan Block 

#



1

 consisted of nine loans which the Plan purchased from the Mellon National Mortgage Corporation of Colorado Profit
Sharing Plan Trust, an unrelated entity, on November 16, 1979 for $152,578. The total income received by the Plan with
respect to this investment was $134,783. Whole Loan Block 

#

1 was serviced by Bank Western, without the receipt of compensation. 
(2) 

Whole Loan Block 

#



2 

represented a 90 percent interest in thirteen loans which the Plan purchased for $818,719 on July 8, 1977 from Midland
Federal Savings and Loan Association (Midland Federal) of Denver, located in Denver, Colorado. Midland Federal,
which was not a party in interest at the time of the investment, retained a 10 percent remainder interest in Whole Loan
Block 

#

2 and it also serviced such loans on behalf of the Plan until its merger with Bank Western in 1984. Servicing fees totaling
$34,495 were paid to Midland Federal and Bank Western in connection with this investment.
 In addition, the Plan received total income of $514,372. 




(3) 

Whole Loan Block 

#



3 

represented a 90 percent interest in seventeen loans which were acquired by the Plan on January 27, 1978 from an unrelated
party, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Denver (First Federal), located in Denver, Colorado. The total
cost of the Plan's investment in Whole Loan Block 

#

3 was $686,318. First Federal retained the 
10 percent remainder interest of such investment and serviced Whole Loan Block 

#

3 on behalf of the Plan in return for an aggregate servicing fee of $83,010. The total income received by the Plan over
the life of this investment was $557,675. 
(4) 

Whole Loan Block 

#



4 

represented a 90 percent interest in seventeen loans which the Plan acquired from an unrelated party, Littleton National
Bank (Littleton) of Littleton, Colorado on December 1, 1976. The total cost of the Plan's investment in Whole Loan
Block 

#

4 was $432,363. Littleton retained a 10 percent interest in Whole Loan Block 

#

4 and serviced such investment on behalf of the Plan for a total servicing fee of $4,785. The total income paid to the
Plan in connection with Whole Loan Block 

#

4 was $281,961. 
4. On July 23, 1990, the Board of Directors of WCIC adopted a Restated Employees' Retirement Fund Agreement which covered
employees of WCIC and its related companies. The Plan then became a section 401(k) cash or deferred compensation plan
effective January 1, 1991. In the process of converting the Plan, the Trustees determined that they should seek outside
investment expertise and provide participants with a choice of investment vehicles. Therefore, in October 1990,
the Trustees selected Brinson Partners, Inc. (Brinson) of Chicago, Illinois to manage the alternative investment
vehicles to be offered to participants. In addition, an existing block of WCIC stock was delivered to Brinson to dispose
of at its discretion.
 Other than the WCIC stock, the goal of the Trustees was to liquidate all of the Plan's other assets and to deliver cash
to Brinson which would be invested at the direction of the participants. 




From October 1990 through the end of 1990, the Trustees proceeded to liquidate the Plan's investments. The bulk of
the liquidations took place in December 1990. However, certain of the Plan's assets, including the subject Assets,
were difficult to sell, primarily due to their small investment size and high servicing costs. Therefore, the Trustees
believed their only alternative was to sell the Assets to Bank Western. Thus, the trades were arranged on December
27, 1990. The Plan paid no fees or commissions to Bank Western in connection with the sale. 
5. The following Asset Summary Table reflects, in pertinent part, the status of the Assets at the time of the December
1990 sale. In addition, the table shows the Asset sales that have been exempted by the Department and discussed further
herein in Representation 7. Presented below are descriptions of the Assets as summarized in the table.

a. The GNMA Pools


As the Asset Summary Table shows, the Plan received $685,418 in income with respect to its investment of $2,537,594
in the GNMA Pools as well as a return of principal of $1,090,061. At the time of the December sale, the GNMA Pools had an
outstanding principal balance of $1,447,533. Bank Western paid the Plan $1,459,094. Thus, the gross return to the
Plan with respect to the GNMA Pools was $3,234,573 and the net gain realized for this investment was $696,979. 
In valuing the GNMA Pools, it is represented that the Trustees obtained estimated fair market prices by telephone
from several unrelated appraisers. However, the applicant states that none of these dealers was willing to buy the
securities at the prices quoted to due to their small aggregate balance. Bank Western ultimately purchased the interests
held by the Plan in GNMA Pools A, C and D for a total cash acquisition price of $1,409,709 based upon market quotations
that were obtained by the Trustees on December 27, 1990 from an unrelated source, ``Bloomberg Financial Markets,
Commodity News'' (the Bloomberg System).

9

 The Plan's investment in GNMA Pool B was valued at $49,385 on or about December 20, 1990 by the Denver, Colorado office
of Prudential Securities, Inc. (formerly, Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.), another unrelated appraiser.





b. The CMO


As of December 1990, the Plan had received interest income of $7,688 with respect to its $75,000 investment in the CMO
as well as a return of principal of $48,428. Also as of December 1990, the CMO had a remaining balance plus accrued interest
of $26,172. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to this investment was $81,035. In addition, the Plan realized
a net gain of $6,035. 
According to the applicant, the Denver office of Merrill Lynch, an unrelated party, determined that, as of December
19, 1990, the CMO would trade for 93 percent of its outstanding balance and it attempted to sell the CMO for that price
but to no avail. Therefore, Bank Western purchased the asset for 93.6875 percent of its par value of $26,172 or $24,519.



c. The Mobile Home Loans


As of December 28, 1990, the Plan had received $14,423 in income with respect to its $29,027 investment in the two Mobile
Home Loans and a return of principal of $4,428. The Plan also had paid total servicing fees of $1,571 with respect to
such investment. At the time of the December sale, the Mobile Home Loans had an outstanding principal balance of $24,599
and Bank Western paid the Plan a total sales price of $23,143. Thus, the Plan received a gross return of $40,423 for this
investment and it realized a net gain of $11,396. 
According to the applicant, there was no independent appraisal of the Mobile Home Loans in order to determine their
fair market value. Instead, SAC, Bank Western's affiliate, 
calculated the fair market value of the Mobile Home Loans by discounting them to yield a market rate of return equal
to the current quoted rate for new mobile home loans. 


d. The Residential Mortgage Loans


Of its investment of $1,003,958 in the Residential Mortgage Loans, the Plan received net income of $254,747 and a return
of principal of $497,032. The Plan also paid servicing fees totaling $11,090. On December 27, 1990, Bank Western paid
the Plan $488,497 for the Residential Mortgage Loans which had, at that time, an outstanding principal balance plus
accrued interest of $506,926. Thus, the Plan received a gross return of $1,240,276 with respect to this investment
and a net gain of $236,318.

<PARENT> FR940525-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

According to the applicant, the method for computing the sales price for the Residential Mortgage Loans required
that the Plan administrator obtain the current market yield for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) purchases
from Telerate, an independent information and pricing service regularly used by Bank Western in establishing quoted
rates for new loan obligations. The Plan administrator then obtained pricing information from the Financial Publishing
Company tables using a twelve year prepayment assumption. The price in the Financial Publishing tables resulted
from discounting the net yield on the loans at the required FHLMC whole loan market yield. 


e. The Whole Loans


With respect to the Whole Loans in which the Plan had made a total investment of $2,089,978, $1,488,791 represented
total income received and $122,290 represented the amount paid in servicing fees. The Plan also received a return
of principal of $1,559,696 for this investment. At the time of the December 1990 sale, the Whole Loans had an outstanding
principal balance plus accrued interest of $530,282. On the date of the sale, Bank Western paid the Plan $507,698 for
the Whole Loans. Thus, the gross return to the Plan with respect to the Whole Loans was $3,433,895 and the net gain realized
was $1,343,917. 
According to the applicant, the method established for calculating the selling price for the Whole Loans was similar
to that utilized to value the Residential Mortgage Loans except that due to the age of the Whole Loans, current market
yields were not used. Therefore, the Plan administrator valued the Whole Loans by referring to the yield on GNMA 9.5
percent securities as reported in the Wall Street Journal because such securities were believed to be representative
of the age of the loans in these pools. The Plan administrator then discounted the net yield on the Whole Loans and determined
the price for the Whole Loans from the Financial Publishing Company tables. 
6. Upon realizing that the aforementioned transactions were prohibited transactions in violation of the Act, Bank
Western offered to sell all of the Assets back to the Plan. However, the Trustees determined that because of the limited
liquidity of the Assets and their investment performance, the Plan would only repurchase those Assets which it could
sell at a higher price than that paid by Bank Western. Consequently, the Plan repurchased GNMA Pool C for $965,181,
which was the same price that Bank Western had paid.

10

 This Asset was subsequently sold by the Trustees to an unrelated party for $996,154. 




7. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western, requests an administrative exemption from the Department with respect
to Bank Western's past purchase from the Plan of interests in the GNMA Pools, the CMO, the Residential Mortgage Loans
and the Whole Loans for an aggregate cost of $2,479,808 as shown in the Asset Summary Table. CNB acknowledges that the
(a) the Plan's acquisition of the Mobile Home Loans which were obtained from SAC, (b) the servicing of the Mobile Home
Loans by SAC for a fee, and (c) the subsequent sale of the Mobile Home Loans by the Plan to Bank Western resulted in prohibited
transactions in violation of the Act. Therefore, CNB is not requesting exemptive relief with respect to any transactions
involving the Mobile Home Loans nor is the Department granting exemptive relief with respect to such loans. To the
extent the resale by Bank Western of its interest in GNMA Pool C constituted a correction within the meaning of the Code,
CNB is not requesting exemptive relief. 
8. Bank Western represents that on October 28, 1992, it filed a Form 5330 with the Service and it paid total excise taxes
of $126,776 that were assessed on the Assets it acquired from the Plan. CNB, as successor in interest to Bank Western,
states that it will pay any additional excise taxes that may be owed to the Service within 90 days of the publication
in the 

Federal Register

 of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein. 
9. In summary, it is represented that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria for an exemption under 
section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) The sale represented a one-time transaction for cash; (b) the sales price for
each Asset was based upon its fair market value as determined by a qualified, independent appraisal; (c) the Plan did
not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (d) CNB will file a Form 5330 with the Service and pay
any applicable excise taxes that may be due on any of the Assets within 90 days of the publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the notice granting the exemptive relief herein. 


Notice to Interested Persons


Notice of the proposed exemption will be given to all interested persons within 30 days of the publication of the notice
of pendency in the 

Federal Register

. Such notice will be given to interested persons by first class mail and will include a copy of the notice of proposed
exemption as published in the 

Federal Register

. The notice will also inform interested persons of their right to comment on and/or to request a public hearing with
respect to the proposed exemption. Comments with respect to the proposed exemption are due within 60 days after the
date of publication of this exemption in the 

Federal Register

.

Batterymarch Financial Management (BFM) 
Located in Boston, Massachusetts; Proposed Exemption


[Application No. D-9230] 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the restrictions of section 406(b)(2) of the Act shall not apply to the proposed cross-trading of equity
securities between various accounts managed by BFM (the Accounts) where at least one Account involved in any cross-trade
is an employee benefit plan account (Plan Account) for which BFM acts as a fiduciary. 


Conditions and Definitions 


This proposed exemption is subject to the following conditions: 
1. (a) Each Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade program is subject to BFM's receipt of a written authorization
executed in advance by a qualified Plan fiduciary, which is independent of BFM and its Affiliates (the Independent
Fiduciary). 
(b) The authorization referred to in paragraph (a) is terminable at will, without penalty to the Plan Account, upon
receipt by BFM of written notice of termination. 


(c) Before an authorization is made for any Account, an independent account representative, which must be an Independent
Fiduciary in the case of a Plan Account (collectively, an Independent Account Representative) must be furnished
with any reasonable available information necessary for the Independent Account Representative to determine whether
the authorization should be made, including (but not limited to) a copy of the proposed and final exemption, an explanation
of how the authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, and any other information
requested by the Independent Account Representative. 
2. Each cross-trade transaction must satisfy the following: 
(a) The cross-trade opportunity must be triggered as a result of an Account participating in the program experiencing
a need to sell equity securities arising from one of the following three circumstances: 
(i) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated;

(ii) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated and
the selection of the particular equity securities to be sold is made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by an optimization program used by BFM (the Optimization Program) which operates, pursuant to certain prescribed
objective criteria, to automatically generate an optimal portfolio for such Accounts; or 



(iii) the application of the Optimization Program to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative requires the sale of a security which is otherwise ranked by BFM as a buy
or a hold for all relevant Accounts under the Stock Evaluation Process. 
(b) With respect to each cross-trade opportunity triggered under paragraph 2(a), the Optimization Program used
by BFM must determine, in the ordinary course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable
universe, that another Account or Accounts participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available
equity securities. 
(c) The cross-trade transaction must take place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise
to the cross-trade opportunity described in paragraph 2(a) above. 
(d) The cross-trade transaction must be effected through a broker which is unaffiliated with BFM and its Affiliates.

(e) The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction must be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the completion of the transaction.
The confirmation must set forth: 
(i) The particular equity securities involved; 
(ii) The number of shares involved;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00086 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00061 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) The price at which the transaction was executed; and 
(iv) The specific triggering event, identified above in paragraph 2(a), which caused the cross-trade transaction
to occur. 
3. (a) Each cross-trade must be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction,
as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ).
In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price must
be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized
independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction
in which case the price must be the last sale price for the securities. If more than one source is used by BFM to price a
particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price must be equal to the average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. No foreign equity securities,
other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available,
shall be cross-traded by the Accounts. 
(b) The equity securities involved in the cross-trade are those for which there is a generally recognized market with
adequate pricing information to enable BFM to use the Optimization Program for the Accounts in the transaction. 
(c) The cross-trade must involve less than 5 percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume of the equity securities
which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding the completion of the transaction. 
4. For any cross-trade opportunity where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account may be sold to
more than one Buying Account, each cross-trade opportunity shall be allocated first to the Buying Account which is
ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality, measured on a numerical basis at the time of
the transaction, until such Account is brought up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Such
Accounts shall then be allocated cross-trade opportunities on a pro rata basis until the Accounts are brought up to
the level of the next Account which is furthest from optimality. This allocation process shall continue until all
cross-trade opportunities involving the equity securities in question are exhausted. 
5. (a) BFM furnishes the Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program at
least once every three months, and not later than 45 days following the period to which it related, a report disclosing:

(i) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the period; and 


(ii) With respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the equity securities involved in
the transaction were traded on the date of such transaction. 
(b) The authorizing Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the program is furnished with a
summary report at least once per year. The summary must be furnished within 45 days after the end of the period to which
it relates, and must contain the following: 
(i) A description of the total amount of the Plan Account's assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade
transactions during the period; 
(ii) A description of BFM's cross-trade practices, if such practices have changed materially during the period covered
by the summary; 
(iii) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of cross-trade transactions may be terminated
upon receipt by BFM of the Independent Fiduciary's written notice to that effect; and 
(iv) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of the Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade
program will continue in effect unless it is terminated.

6. The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by
BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan).

7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer
or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if
the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust.

8. BFM receives no fee or other compensation (other than its agreed investment management fee) with respect to any
cross-trade transaction.

9. BFM is a discretionary investment manager with respect to Plan Accounts participating in the cross-trade program
and does not cause any Plan Account to purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track
or replicate the portfolio of an independently maintained third party index.

10. For purposes of this proposed exemption:

(a) ``Account'' means a Plan Account or a Non-Plan Account;

(b) ``Affiliate'' means any person directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with Batterymarch;

(c) ``Buying Account'' means the Account which seeks to purchase equity securities in a cross-trade transaction;

(d) ``Cross-trade transaction'' means a purchase and sale of equity securities between Accounts for which BFM or
an Affiliate is acting as a trustee or investment manager;

(e) ``Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of one or more employee benefit plans which
are subject to the Act;

(f) ``Independent Account Representative'' means the authorized representative of the Account. In the case of a
Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative must be an Independent Fiduciary authorized to act for the
Plan Account;

(g) ``Non-Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of clients which are not employee benefit
plans subject to the Act;

(h) ``Selling Account'' means the Account which seeks to sell its equity securities in a cross-trade transaction;
and

(i) The ``Optimization Program'' means a computer program developed by a third party, independent of BFM and its Affiliates,
which BFM uses pursuant to a license agreement and which utilizes objective mathematical formulas to construct ``optimal''
portfolios for each Account.



Summary of Facts and Representations



1. BFM is a business trust organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and registered as an investment
adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. BFM currently manages on a discretionary basis
approximately $7 billion in assets, of which approximately $4 billion consists of assets of Plan Accounts.

2. BFM represents that there are certain circumstances when it is required to liquidate all or a portion of the equity
securities in an Account for which it acts as an investment manager. BFM proposes to cross-trade equity securities
between the Accounts in situations where the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account is made either
directly by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of a pre-established contractual obligation
established by the Independent Account Representative. In the case of a Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative
must be an authorized Independent Fiduciary. In all cross-trade situations, the decision as to the particular equity
securities to be sold at the time of the transaction will be made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by operation of the Optimization Program utilized by BFM. In the case of all Accounts, the Independent Account Representative
will be a person which is unrelated to BFM and its Affiliates. Cross-trade transactions will not involve assets of
any Batterymarch Plan.

3. BFM states that a cross-trade opportunity, pursuant to the requested exemption, will arise only if the need to sell
equity securities from a Selling Account occurs as a result of one of the following ``trigger events''.

(a) The Independent Account Representative directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated. In such cases,
both the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account and the decision regarding the particular equity
securities to be sold will be made by the Independent Account Representative. 

(b) The Independent Account Representative directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated. In such instances,
the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account will be made by the Independent Account Representative.
However, the determination of the particular equity securities to be sold by the Selling Account will be made either
by the Independent Account Representative or by the Optimization Program (as described below). 

(c) The investment restrictions and objectives established by the Independent Account Representative for the Selling
Account require that a particular security or a particular type of security be sold. Whenever a choice must be made
as to particular equity securities to be sold, the Optimization Program will select the equity securities from the
Account's holdings in a manner calculated to best bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment
restrictions. 

BFM states that for all ``trigger events'' described above the selection of the specific equity securities to be sold
by the Selling Account through the operation of the Optimization Program will involve an automatic mechanical process,
pursuant to certain prescribed investment restrictions and objectives from an Independent Account Representative,
and will not involve any exercise of investment discretion by BFM. 

With respect to each potential cross-trade transaction, the Optimization Program will determine, in the ordinary
course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable universe, that another Account or Accounts
participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available equity securities. In addition, each cross-trade
transaction will occur within three business days from the occurrence of the triggering event which establishes
the cross-trade opportunity. 

4. BFM represents that there are two fundamental components to its investment process_the Stock Evaluation Process
and the Portfolio Construction Process. 

With respect to the Stock Evaluation Process, BFM evaluates all of the equity securities in the applicable universe
by applying a variety of objective criteria and mathematical computations to rank the equity securities and characterize
each security with a ``buy'', a ``hold'', or a ``sell'' classification. BFM states that it does exercise some degree
of discretion in the Stock Evaluation Process portion of the investment process. For example, BFM selects the particular
strategic themes that are utilized from time to time in this process.

11

 However, BFM states that the Stock Evaluation Process and the strategic themes used at a particular time are applied
in exactly the same fashion for all Accounts which have directed BFM to invest in a particular universe of securities.
Thus, the exact same stock rankings and buy-hold-sell classifications are applied uniformly for each security in
every Account within such universe. The Stock Evaluation Process will never, in and of itself, give rise to direct
cross-trade opportunities because the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will be the same for every Account
in the particular universe. BFM states that it is only in the second part of the overall investment process (i.e. the
Portfolio Construction Process), when the specific investment objectives and restrictions which have been established
by the Independent Account Representative for the Account are overlaid against the results of the Stock Evaluation
Process, that differences appear for the various Accounts within a particular universe. 





With respect to the Portfolio Construction Process, BFM represents that the results of the Stock Evaluation Process
are brought together with the particular facts applicable to each Account to generate the optimal portfolio for that
Account and suggested trades to arrive at that optimal portfolio. The Portfolio Construction Process is driven by
the Optimization Program. The Optimization Program receives the relevant information and automatically generates
the optimal portfolio and the suggested buy and sell decisions that are designed to move a particular Account toward
``optimality'' (i.e. maximum expected return for a prescribed level of risk). The information utilized in the Portfolio
Construction Process consists of (i) the existing make-up of the portfolio of the particular Account, (ii) the investment
objectives and restrictions which have been established by the Independent Account Representative for the Account,
and (iii) objective economic data (such as existing market prices for equity securities, price-earnings ratios
for such securities, etc.) which is obtained by BFM from independent sources.

BFM represents that the results of its investment process will create cross-trade opportunities for the Accounts
under the following circumstances: (1) When the Independent Account Representative for an Account directs a liquidation
of all or a portion of the equity securities in the Account, as described in condition 2(a) (i) and (ii) above; or (2)
when the application of the Optimization Program in the Portfolio Construction Process requires the sale of a security
which is ranked as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter instance, the sale of the
security results from the investment objectives and restrictions applicable to the Account which are established
by the Independent Account Representative, as described in condition 2(a)(iii) above. 

For example, the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 5 percent of the assets of the
Account can be invested in any one security. If a particular holding appreciates in value to a point where it exceeds
5 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold by the Account to comply with this restriction even
though the stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. Alternatively,
the applicable investment restrictions might provide that not more than 10 percent of the assets of the Account can
be invested in equity securities of any one industry. If the aggregate value of all such equity securities in the Account
exceeds 10 percent of the Account's assets, the excess shares must be sold to comply with this restriction even though
the particular stock is otherwise classified as a ``buy'' or ``hold'' under the Stock Evaluation Process. In the latter
case, the Optimization Program would select the particular equity securities to be sold from the Account's holdings
in that industry so as to bring the Account into compliance with the applicable investment restriction and move the
Account toward ``optimality''. 

BFM represents that none of the Accounts in the proposed cross-trading program would be index funds that attempt to
track or replicate a particular independently maintained index, such as the Standard & Poors 500 Index (the S&P
500). Thus, under the proposed exemption, no Plan Account will purchase or sell equity securities with another Account
in order to merely track such an index. In all cases, BFM will exercise some degree of investment discretion to determine
which particular equity securities are desirable investments for the Accounts. As noted above, the rankings of each
security are developed as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and are identical for all Accounts invested in a particular
universe of equity securities. These rankings and the results of the Stock Evaluation Process will not be tied to any
particular index or to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established for the Account by its Independent
Account Representative. However, an index may be used as part of the investment objectives or restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative, most typically as either a benchmark against which the Account's performance
is to be measured or a further restriction on the universe of securities available for an Account. 

For example, an Account might be subject to an investment objective that seeks to outperform the S&P 500 Index
to the maximum extent, subject to certain volatility parameters or risk tolerance levels specified by the Independent
Account Representative. In this situation, the foregoing investment objective would be taken into account by the
Optimization Program in determining the buys and sells for this Account which could lead to cross-trade opportunities.

12

 Such an Account would be an actively managed account, not an index fund, even though the benchmark against which its
performance is measured would be an index. 





As a further example, an Account might be established which is subject to an investment restriction providing that
the Account may be invested only in equity securities which constitute the 100 largest equity securities (by market
capitalization) in the S&P 500 Index. This investment restriction will be incorporated by the Optimization
Program as part of the Portfolio Construction Process for the Account, taking into account the uniform rankings developed
by BFM for all of the equity securities in the particular universe. If a security ceases to be one of the 100 largest equity
securities in the S&P 500 Index, it would no longer be eligible to be held by the Account and would have to be sold.
This would be a trigger event that would give rise to a direct cross-trade opportunity whereby other Accounts which
are not so limited would be able to purchase this security from the Selling Account, assuming that the Optimization
Program indicates that such a purchase would be desirable for those Accounts in order to move toward ``optimality''.

5. The Optimization Program is a computer program developed by an independent third party and utilized by BFM pursuant
to a license agreement. Various such programs are commercially available. BFM represents that the ability to exercise
discretion for the operation of the Optimization Program is limited. BFM selects the Optimization Program, selects
and weighs the strategic themes used at any point in time in the Stock Evaluation Process, and develops certain mathematical
models used as data for the Optimization Program. Once installed, the Optimization Program typically remains in
place without material change for a lengthy period of time (2 to 10 years). While the strategic themes and mathematical
models are changed more frequently, they usually remain unchanged for approximately 12 months. BFM states that the
Optimization Program operates in an automatic fashion and that actions within BFM's discretionary control (e.g.
changing its strategic themes or changing the mathematical models used in its stock rankings for the Stock Evaluation
Process) will not generate direct cross-trade transactions.

6. BFM uses the Optimization Program on a daily basis to examine all equity securities in the applicable universe and
to determine the specific equity securities, if any, to be purchased for each Account in order to achieve the optimal
portfolio for that Account. Each universe is developed by BFM as part of the Stock Evaluation Process and is uniform
for all Accounts for which that particular universe is relevant.

For example, in the context of domestic equity securities, BFM determines the universe of securities to be considered
for potential investment as part of the Stock Evaluation Process. The universe for domestic equity clients currently
consists of all U.S. publicly-traded common stocks, excluding any such stock which has a market capitalization of
less than $50 million. BFM states that this domestic equity securities universe, which includes several thousand
stocks, is identical for all of BFM's domestic equity Accounts unless certain restrictions are imposed by the Independent
Account Representative.

In addition to domestic equity Accounts, BFM uses the Optimization Program to examine data on foreign equity securities
for Accounts that have designated investment objectives which permit such securities for their portfolios. At the
present time, the potential universe of securities for such Accounts would include equity securities listed on exchanges
in the following countries: Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Denmark; Finland; France; Germany; Hong Kong;
Ireland; Italy; Japan; Malaysia; Mexico; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Singapore; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland;
and the United Kingdom. BFM states that these are the countries which today have sufficiently developed securities
markets (including adequate data on the exchange-traded securities) to permit use of the Optimization Program for
the Accounts. BFM represents that the two-part investment process (i.e. the Stock Evaluation Process and the Portfolio
Construction Process) operates in substantially the same manner for foreign equity securities as it does for domestic
equity securities. In all cases involving either domestic or foreign equity securities, the Independent Account
Representative for each Account will determine which universe is relevant for the Account.

To the extent there are any equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account by reason of one of the triggering
events, the Optimization Program will include the equity securities in its analysis of all available equity securities
in a particular universe, taking into account the lower transaction costs available for cross-trade transactions
involving such securities. However, BFM states that the opportunity for a cross-trade will not influence the Optimization
Program's analysis and determination as to whether such securities should be bought or sold for an Account except
to the extent transaction costs are lower.

<TEXT>
 

In the event any of the equity securities available for sale in cross-trade transactions are attractive to more than
one Account, the Optimization Program will automatically allocate such securities among the Accounts on a consistent,
objective basis according to the allocation methodology described herein (see Item 14 below). The allocation methodology
will be disclosed to, and approved by, the Independent Account Representatives. Since the determination and allocation
of cross-trade opportunities among potential Buying Accounts will be performed automatically by the Optimization
Program, BFM states that it will be unable to use any discretion to benefit one Account over another Account. 
7. BFM represents that since particular equity securities which are sold by a Selling Account in one of the ``trigger
events'' described above are often desirable investments (i.e. classified as a ``buy'' or a ``hold'' under the Stock
Evaluation Process) for BFM's other Accounts, the opportunity to cross-trade such securities would significantly
reduce the transaction costs incurred by both the Selling Accounts and the Buying Accounts. BFM states that these
savings result from the fact that the independent broker effecting a cross-trade transaction will effect the transaction
for a lower commission. The independent broker will effect these transactions for approximately .5

$

 per share. By contrast, if BFM were to effect the same trade other than by a cross-trade transaction, the commission
would be approximately 2$ per share. In the context of foreign equity securities, where brokerage commissions
are significantly higher, the potential savings on commissions would be even greater. 
BFM states that cross-trading also avoids the bid/ask differential that would ordinarily occur in such transactions
because the price received by the Selling Account for a particular equity security will be the same price paid by the
Buying Account. The elimination of any price differential in equity securities that are cross-traded will result
in savings of approximately 1$ per share for each Account. 
In addition, the ability to use cross-trade transactions to shift equity securities directly from a Selling Account
to a Buying Account will enable BFM to implement optimal investment strategies for the Accounts more effectively.
First, the allocation of equity securities necessary to bring Accounts closer to optimality would be easier because
all ``buys'' will be net position buys for the Accounts without any bid/offer spread. Second, there is a timing efficiency
to be achieved if direct cross-trades are permitted. Under BFM's current procedures, if an Account has sold a particular
security on a particular day, no other Account is permitted to buy that security on that day. Rather, all purchases
of such security are deferred until the next day. Similarly, if an Account has bought a particular security on a given
day, other Accounts are not permitted to sell that security on the same day. Under the requested exemption, BFM would
be able to net these contemporaneous buy and sell orders on the same day.

Finally, the ability to effect direct cross-trades will avoid the adverse consequences of any market impact which
trading in particular equity securities may generate. 
8. BFM represents that each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading
program must have total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained
by a single employer or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets
of such plans if the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 
9. The Independent Fiduciary will provide written authorization before a Plan Account is permitted to participate
in BFM's cross-trade program. This authorization will be terminable at will upon written notice by the Independent
Fiduciary. BFM will receive no additional fee or other compensation for providing such cross-trading services.
No penalty or other charge will be made as a result of the termination of an Account's participation in the cross-trade
program. Before any authorization is made by a Plan Account, BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary for the Plan
Account with all reasonably available materials necessary to permit an evaluation of the cross-trade program by
such fiduciary. These materials will include a copy of the proposed and final exemption, an explanation of how the
Plan Account's authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, and any other reasonably
available information requested by the Independent Fiduciary. 
10. The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction will be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the transaction is completed. The
confirmation will set forth information regarding the particular equity securities involved, the number of shares
involved, the price at which the transaction was executed, and the specific ``trigger event'' (identified in condition
2(a) above) which caused the cross-trade transaction to occur. 
11. BFM will provide the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program with
a report, at least once every three months and not later than 45 days following the period for the report, setting forth:
(a) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the previous period; and
(b) with respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the subject equity securities were
traded on the date of such transaction. In addition, the Independent Fiduciary of each Plan Account participating
in the cross-trade program will be provided with a summary report at least once a year, and not later than 45 days after
the end of the period for the report, which will include: (a) A description of the total amount of Plan Account assets,
by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade transactions completed during the year; (b) a statement that
the Independent Fiduciary's authorization for the Plan Account to participate in the cross-trade program can be
terminated without penalty upon BFM's receipt of a written notice to that effect; (c) a statement that the Independent
Fiduciary's authorization regarding the cross-trade program will continue unless it is terminated; and (d) a description
of any material change in BFM's cross-trade practices during the period covered by the summary report. 
BFM states that these reports will provide the Independent Fiduciary with a mechanism for monitoring the operation
of the cross-trade program. BFM represents that the authorization procedures and the limited circumstances in which
cross-trade transactions will be considered, in conjunction with BFM's use of the Optimization Program, will prevent
BFM from favoring one Account at the expense of another Account in a cross-trade transaction. 
12. The equity securities involved in any cross-trade transaction will be only those for which there is a generally
recognized market with adequate pricing information to permit use of the Optimization Program for the Accounts.
All cross-trades will be effected at prices determined according to an established, fixed methodology which will
be applied uniformly to all Accounts. Under this pricing methodology, each cross-trade transaction will be effected
at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction, as quoted by the exchange on
which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ). In the case of domestic
equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price will be the mean between
the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized independent
sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction in which case
the price will be the last sale price for the securities. However, if more than one source is used by BFM to price a particular
domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price will be equal to the average of the highest current
independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. BFM states that no foreign equity
securities, other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are
readily available, will be cross-traded by the Accounts. The pricing methodology will be communicated to the Independent
Account Representative at the beginning of the Account's participation in the cross-trade program. The pricing
methodology will apply to all cross-trade transactions implemented by BFM under the proposed exemption. 
BFM states that utilization of an established, fixed pricing methodology will prevent it from being able to use any
discretion to manipulate cross-trades to benefit one Account over another Account. Moreover, BFM will in all cases
utilize price data obtained from an independent pricing source.

<TEXT>
 

13. A cross-trade transaction will be effected only where the trade involves less than 5 percent of the aggregate average
daily trading volume for the equity securities which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding
the completion of the transaction. BFM states that this percentage limitation attempts to address the potential
impact which a large trade might have in the sale of equity securities on the open market. Thus, BFM will only engage
in cross-trade transactions where the size of the trade will ensure that the price utilized in the cross-trade will
not differ materially from what would have been the market price for the equity securities in an open market transaction.

14. BFM represents that where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account present an attractive investment
opportunity for more than one Buying Account, BFM will make the allocation to that Buying Account which is ranked by
the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality.
 BFM states that each Account's distance from optimality can be measured and quantified on a numerical basis at any
point in time. Cross-trade opportunities would continue to be allocated to such a Buying Account until it is brought
up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Thereafter, the cross-trade opportunities would
be allocated to both of these Accounts pro rata until they are brought up to the level of the Account which is next furthest
from optimality, and so on until all cross-trading opportunities involving the equity securities in question are
exhausted. BFM states that this allocation process will operate in a mechanical, objective fashion and will not be
manipulated in any way by BFM to benefit particular Accounts during the operation of the cross-trading program. 




15. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions will satisfy the criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act because, among other things: 
(a) An Independent Fiduciary must provide written authorization, which is terminable at will, to BFM to permit the
Account to participate in the cross-trading program; 
(b) All cross-trade transactions will be effected within three business days of the triggering event creating the
cross-trade opportunity; 
(c) All cross-trade transactions will be effected at a price determined pursuant to a established, fixed methodology
using independent pricing sources and will be applied uniformly to all Accounts; 
(d) All cross-trade opportunities will be subject to an allocation methodology which is designed to benefit Accounts
which are ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality and will not be manipulated by BFM to
benefit particular Accounts;
(e) A cross-trade transaction will be effected only if certain volume requirements are satisfied; 
(f) All equity securities (i.e. either foreign or domestic) involved in cross-trade transactions will be securities
for which there is a generally recognized market; 
(g) BFM will receive no additional fees as a result of the proposed cross-trade transactions; 
(h) BFM will provide periodic reporting of the cross-trade transactions to the Independent Fiduciaries of the participating
Plan Accounts; 
(i) The opportunity to participate in the cross-trade program will save significant sums of money for the Accounts
because cross-trading reduces brokerage commissions, avoids the bid/ask differential in such transactions, and
provides more efficient implementation of optimal investment strategies; 
(j) Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account which participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets of at least $25 million, or must be part of a master trust of plans maintained by a single employer or controlled
group of employers which has at least $25 million in total assets; and 
(k) The cross-trade transactions will not involve the assets of any Batterymarch Plan.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<DOCTITLE>Grant of Individual Exemptions; Hensel Phelps Construction Co. Profit Sharing Plan, et al. </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemptions. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register 

of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.


Statutory Findings


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; </DOCTITLE>
Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses 
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations 



I. Background 



Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. 
Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as 
amended (the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any 
amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision of 
section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority 
to issue and make immediately effective any amendment to an operating 
license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves 
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person. 

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or 
proposed to be issued from May 2, 1994, through May 13, 1994. The last 
biweekly notice was published on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24745). 



Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to 
Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 




The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following 
amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the 
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the 
facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different 
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed 
determination for each amendment request is shown below. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed 
determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be considered in making any final 
determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the 
expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances 
change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way 
would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the 
Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-
day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the 
amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final 
determination will consider all public and State comments received before 
action is taken. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish 
in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity 
for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take 
this action will occur very infrequently. 


Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and 
Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications 
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number 
of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to 
Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland 
from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments 
received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman 
Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests 
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 


By June 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with 
respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating 
license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding 
and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a 
written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. 
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed 
in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic 
Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult 
a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's 
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, 
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility 
involved. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is 
filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing 
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety 
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and 
the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will 
issue a notice of a hearing or an appropriate order. 


As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall 
set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the 
proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the 
proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why 
intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following 
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made 
a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's 
property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the 
possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the 
petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific 
aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner 
wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to 
intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition 
without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first 
prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended 
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 


Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference 
scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the 
petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which 
are sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of 
a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or 
controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief 
explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement of the 
alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which 
the petitioner intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. 
The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and 
documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner 
intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner 
must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists 
with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall 
be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under 
consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle 
the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement 
which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention 
will not be permitted to participate as a party. 


Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject 
to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the 
opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including 
the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final 
determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The 
final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no 
significant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment 
and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a 
hearing. Any hearing held would take place after issuance of the 
amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a 
significant hazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before 
the issuance of any amendment. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be 
filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services 
Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the 
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above 
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice 
period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the 
Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 
248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should 
be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message 
addressed to (

Project Director

): petitioner's name and telephone number, 
date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number 
of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be 
sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 



Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended 
petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests for a hearing will not be 
entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer 
or the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request 
should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR 
2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 


For further details with respect to this action, see the application 
for amendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission's 
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, 
DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular facility 
involved.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 


1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed change [sic] is administrative
in nature. These changes do not alter the configuration or operation of the facility. The Limiting Safety Systems
Settings and Safety Limits specified in the current Technical 
Specifications remain unchanged. 

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The safety analysis of the facility remains complete and accurate. There are no physical changes to the
facility and the plant conditions for which the design basis accidents have been evaluated are still valid. The operating
procedure and 
emergency procedures are unaffected with the possible exception of resolving special notations that may have recognized
the typographical errors that are being corrected. 

3. The margins of safety are established through the Limiting Conditions of Operation, Limiting Safety Systems Settings
and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications. Since there are no changes to the physical design or
operation of the facility, these margins will not be changed.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

The proposed changes do not involve an [significant hazards 
consideration] SHC because the changes would not:




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change modifies SR 4.6.1.2.d. Currently this SR indicates the purge supply and exhaust valves have an
exception from the 10CFR50 Appendix J, Type B and C tests. The proposed technical specification change is consistent
with current surveillance procedures and the [Final Safety Analysis Report] 
FSAR. The second proposed change, which removes SR 4.6.1.2.f, reflects current containment leakage surveillance
requirements. The present location of SR 4.6.1.2.f could imply that containment leakage surveillance requirements
are met by performing SR 4.9.9. However, SR 4.9.9 is applicable only during core alterations or movement of irradiated
fuel and not during the modes when 
Technical Specification 3.6.1.2 is applicable. These changes have no effect on actual Appendix J testing of valves
or the current plant accident analysis. Therefore, the proposed changes cannot increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously analyzed. 

The proposed changes do not introduce any new failure modes. The 
plant will continue to operate as designed and there will be no 
change to the testing of valves. The proposed changes will not 
modify the plant response to the point where it can be considered 
a new accident. Therefore, the proposed changes will not create 
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form any 
previously evaluated. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed changes modify SR 4.6.1.2.d which, as presently 
written, indicates that the purge supply and exhaust valves are 
an exception to the 10CFR50 Appendix J, Type B and C test and 
therefore, no exception is required. This is supported by 
current surveillance procedures which include the purge supply 
and exhaust valves as part of the Type B and C tests. In 
addition, the proposed changes are consistent with the FSAR. 
FSAR Table 7.3-1 ``Containment Penetrations,'' lists the purge 
supply and exhaust valves as required to receive Type B and C 
tests. Therefore, these proposed changes revise SR 4.6.1.2.d to 
reflect actual surveillance procedures and offer no revisions or 
reductions to current surveillance testing. Therefore, these 
changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin 
of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point 
Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York 





Date of amendment request: 

April 13, 1994 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment request would revise the Technical Specifications to amend Sections 3.1.F and 4.13 to 
allow the repair of steam generator tubes by sleeving as an alternative to 
plugging. Additionally, a new tube acceptance criteria, F*, is proposed 
which would allow tubes that are degraded in a location not affecting 
structural integrity of the tube to remain in service. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposed 
Technical Specification change is deemed to involve no significant 
hazards considerations because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 
would not:

(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated since the integrity of the 
steam generator tubes after sleeving will be equivalent to that 
of the original tubes. The sleeve, sleeve joint, and F* joint 
have been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted 
condition loadings in accordance with NRC Regulatory [G]uide 
1.121 safety factors. The potential for a tube rupture is not 
increased with sleeving or F*. At worst case, a tube leak would 
occur, resulting in a small primary to secondary leak. Primary 
to secondary leakage occurring from within the sleeved or F* 
portions of the tube is bounded by the steam generator tube 
rupture scenario evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report. 
In addition, the steam generator tube remains capable of 
performing its required heat transfer function. Placing a sleeve 
in the steam generator tube or leaving a tube in service with a 
defect in a portion of the tube that provides no function results 
in a more efficient steam generator than plugging an affected 
tube. Thus, the consequences of any accident previously 
evaluated are not increased because the structural integrity and 
the heat transfer capability of the steam generators are not 
significantly altered by the proposed change. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated because both the 
structural integrity and the heat transfer capability of the 
steam generators will not be significantly affected by the use of 
either of the sleeving processes or the implementation of the F* 
criteria. Testing and previous experience indicate that any 
primary to secondary leakage would be well below technical 
specification limits. In addition, in the unlikely event the 
defective tube failed completely at the defect, the remaining 
sleeve end or F* joint would restrain tube movement due to the 
sleeve end geometry or length of expanded contact within the 
tubesheet bore. Therefore, there is no threat to adjacent tubes 
and no other plant systems will be affected by this change. 
Thus, there is no potential for a new or different kind of 
accident. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The heat 
transfer capabilities of Indian Point 2 Steam Generators will be 
improved by utilizing the proposed sleeving process or 
implementing the F* criteria rather than the currently required 
tube plugging and subsequent loss of heat transfer area. The 
proposed change will allow a repaired (sleeved) tube or a tube 
with a tube end defect below the F* distance to remain in 
service, rather than completely blocking the tube's flow with 
plugs. Because the structural integrity of the tubes will be 
unaltered, the net effect of implementing the proposed change, 
rather than the currently required plugging procedure, will be an 
increase in the heat transfer characteristics of the steam 
generator. Westinghouse has done an evaluation of selected LOCA 
[loss-of-coolant accident] and non-LOCA transients to verify that 
use of sleeves resulting in a plugging equivalency at the current 
plant limit will not have an adverse affect on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the plant. Therefore, the margin
of 
safety is not reduced.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request 
involves no significant hazards consideration.

County, Michigan 




Date of amendment request:

 November 15, 1991, as supplemented February 22, 
March 11, and April 7, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The amendment request, as submitted 
November 15, 1991, proposed completely rewritten requirements for the 
instrumentation and control (I&C) sections of the Palisades Technical 
Specifications (TS) and was initially noticed in the 

Federal Register

 
October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48819). Since that time the licensee has updated 
its submittal, providing (1) changes to pages affected by intervening 
amendments, (2) clarifications suggested by NRC and Palisades reviewers, 
(3) addition of two instrument channels to the accident monitoring 
instruments Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO), (4) deletion of 
surveillance requirements for safety injection tank (SIT) instruments, as 
suggested by Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications 
Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power 
Operation,'' and (5) addition of a general ``Applicability'' LCO which appears 
in the Standard TS but not in the Palisades TS. Changes (4) and (5) were 
not addressed in the initial proposed no significant hazards consideration (NSH) determination. The licensee's
NSH analysis for these two changes was 
provided in its April 7, 1994, letter to the NRC and is discussed below. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


 

Consumers Power Company finds that activities associated with the 
February 22, 1994 and March 11, 1994 Instrument and Control 
Technical Specification change revisions include no significant 
hazards; and accordingly, a no significant hazards determination 
in accordance with 10CFR50.92(c) is justified. The following 
summary supports the finding that the proposed change would not: 
1. 

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 
Neither the deletion of instrument surveillance requirements for the 
Safety Injection Tank (SIT) instrumentation nor the addition of 
allowance of temporarily returning inoperable equipment to service for 
maintenance or testing would affect the probability or consequences of 
an accident. 
The SIT instrument channels themselves have no accident function. 
Their only purpose is to allow verification that the SITs themselves 
are operable. Surveillance requirements for these instruments were 
purposely deleted from STS during the Technical Specification 
Improvement Program. Their removal from Technical Specifications was 
suggested in GL 93-05. 
Returning inoperable equipment to service as allowed by LCO 3.0.5 is 
necessary if failed channels are to be restored to operable status. 
The restoration of such channels enhances the ability to monitor for 
and mitigate abnormal operating conditions and accidents. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously 
evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated. 


The proposed changes would not alter the operating conditions of the 
plant systems, and would not reduce the reliability of any plant 
safety equipment. 
Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. 

Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes would not affect the setpoints, capacities, or 
operating limits for any equipment. Therefore, the proposed changes 
do not involve a significant reduction of a margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request, as revised, involves no significant hazards 
consideration.

Consumers Power Company, Docket No. 50-255, Palisades Plant, Van Buren 
County, Michigan 




Date of amendment request: 

April 7, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would change certain Technical Specifications (TS) to relocate fuel cycle-specific 
parameter limits that can generally change with core reloads to a Core 
Operating Limits Report (COLR) in accordance with the guidance of Generic 
Letter 88-16, ``Removal of Cycle-Specific Parameter Limits from Technical 
Specifications.'' Several of the TS bases would also be revised to refer to 
limits relocated to the COLR. In each case where TS limits would be 
relocated to the COLR, the limits placed in the COLR would be unchanged and 
the appropriate bases would be revised accordingly. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
The following evaluation supports the finding that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would
not: 



1. 

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 


The proposed changes to the TS simply move the values and parameters 
for fuel cycle-specific limits from the TS to a Core Operating Limits 
Report (COLR). The requirements to maintain the plant within 
appropriate bounds are retained in the TS. The values of the cycle-specific parameter limits in the COLR are determined
using an NRC-approved methodology and remain consistent with all applicable limits 
of the plant safety analyses that are addressed in the Final Safety 
Analysis Report (FSAR). A requirements for the COLR and 
identification of the approved methodology documents are added to the 
TS. There are no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, 
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not 
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of 
an accident previously evaluated. 
2. 

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from 
any previously evaluated. 
As discussed above, the proposed changes do not remove or alleviate 
any requirements to maintain the plant within the appropriate bounds. 
There are no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, 
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any 
previously evaluated. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes to the TS simply move the values and parameters 
for cycle-specific limits from the Specifications to a Core Operating 
Limits Report (COLR). The requirements to maintain the plant within 
appropriate bounds are retained in the TS. The values of the cycle-specific parameter limits in the COLR are determined
using an NRC-approved methodology and remain consistent with all applicable limits 
of the plant safety analyses that are addressed in the Final Safety 
Analysis Report (FSAR). A requirement for the COLR and identification 
of the approved methodology documents are added to the TS. There are 
no associated changes in plant operation. Therefore, operation of the 
facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request:

 March 29, 1994, as corrected April 26, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would modify the surveillance requirements for scram discharge volume vent and drain valves
and isolation actuation instrumentation and modify the required actions and surveillance requirements for the
emergency diesel generators to reduce 
testing during power operation. These changes are in accordance with 
guidance contained in Generic Letter (GL) 93-05 ``Line-Item Technical 
Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing 
During Power Operation,'' dated September 27, 1993. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 




1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes to the frequency of testing for these 
components will reduce the probability of failure due to wear and 
eliminate the possibility of initiating transients during testing 
of these components. Therefore, the proposed changes will result 
in a decrease in the probability of previously evaluated 
accidents. Further, the proposed changes do not alter the 
design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
therefore, do not affect the consequences of any previously 
evaluated accident. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. As stated above, the proposed changes do not alter 
the design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
therefore, no new accident scenarios are created. 
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. As developed in Reference 3 [NUREG-1366, 
``Improvement to Technical Specification Surveillance 
Requirements,'' dated December 1992] and endorsed in Reference 2 
[GL 93-05], the proposed changes to the testing frequency will 
increase the margin of safety through reduced equipment wear and 
elimination of opportunities to induce transients. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 26, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would relocate 
tables of instrument response time limits from the Technical Specifications 
to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) in accordance with the 
guidance contained in Generic Letter 93-08 dated December 29, 1993. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the 
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes delete and subsequently relocate the details 
of Technical Specification Table 3.3.1-2, ``REACTOR PROTECTION 
SYSTEM RESPONSE TIMES,'' Table 3.3.2-3, ``ISOLATION ACTUATION 
SYSTEM INSTRUMENTATION RESPONSE TIME,'' and Table 3.3.3-3, 
``EMERGENCY CORE COOLING SYSTEM RESPONSE TIMES,'' consistent with 
the guidance provided by Generic Letter 93-08 dated, December 29, 
1993, entitled, ``Relocation of Technical Specification Tables of 
Instrument Response Time Limits.'' Generic Letter 93-08 
recommends the removal and subsequent relocation of various 
Technical Specification tables which denote instrument and system 
response time limits. The response time limits and associated 
footnotes are proposed to be relocated to the Fermi 2 Updated 
Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). This allows Fermi 2 to 
administratively control subsequent changes to the response time 
limit tables in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59. The procedures which 
contain the various response time limits are also subject to the 
change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section 
of the Technical Specifications. The proposed change only 
relocates the existing response time limits. The Surveillance 
Requirements and associated Actions are not affected and remain 
in the Technical Specifications. Relocating this information 
does not affect the initial conditions of a design basis accident 
or transient analysis. Since any subsequent changes to the UFSAR 
or procedures are evaluated in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, no 
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident 
previously evaluated is allowed. Further, the proposed changes 
do not alter the design, function, or operation of the components 
involved and therefore, do not affect the consequences of any 
previously evaluated accident. 
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. The proposed changes will not impose any different 
operational or surveillance requirements. The changes propose to 
relocate these response time limit tables to other plant 
documents whereby adequate control of information is maintained. 
Further, as stated above, the proposed changes do not alter the 
design, function, or operation of the components involved and 
therefore, no new accident scenarios are created. 
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. The proposed change will not reduce a margin 
of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis 
assumption. The proposed change does not alter the scope of 
equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to 
surveillance testing nor does the proposed change affect any 
instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. In addition, 
the values to be transposed from the Technical Specifications to 
the UFSAR are the same as the exiting Technical Specifications. 
Since any future changes to these requirements in the UFSAR or 
procedures will be evaluated per the requirements of 10 CFR 50.59, 
no reduction in a margin of safety is allowed. Therefore, the 
change does not involve a significant reduction in margin of 
safety. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Duke Power Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-413 and 50-414, Catawba Nuclear 
Station, Units 1 and 2, York County, South Carolina 




Date of amendment request:

 March 30, 1994.


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendments would allow the analog channel operational test interval for radiation monitoring 
instrumentation to be increased from monthly to quarterly. The proposed 
amendments are said by the licensee to be consistent with NRC staff 
recommendations and guidance contained in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to 
Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements,'' and Generic Letter 
93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce 
Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 



Criterion 1 


The requested amendments will not involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
Decreasing the frequency of the radiation monitor analog channel 
operational test from monthly to quarterly will have no impact upon 
the probability of any accident, since the radiation monitors are not 
accident initiating equipment. Also, no credit is taken in accident 
analyses for automatic actions performed by radiation monitors 
contained in Catawba's Technical Specifications, so the requested 
amendments will have no adverse impact upon the consequences of any 
accident. 


Criterion 2 


The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As 
stated above, the radiation monitors are not accident initiating 
equipment. No new failure modes can be created from an accident 
standpoint. The plant will not be operated in a different manner. 


Criterion 3 


The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. Plant safety margins will be unaffected by the 
proposed changes. No safety equipment which is taken credit for in 
accident analyses will be affected by the requested amendments. The 
availability of the affected radiation monitors will be increased as a 
result of the proposed amendments because the monitors will not have 
to be made unavailable for testing as frequently. In addition, 
radiation monitor operating experience supports the proposed 
amendments. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the 
NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG-1366 and Generic Letter 
93-05. 
Based upon the preceding analyses, Duke Power Company concludes that 
the requested amendments do not involve a significant hazards 
consideration.

Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-250 and 50-251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County,
Florida 





Date of amendment request:

 April 19, 1994.



Description of amendment request:

 The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications (TS) 4.0.5 a, ``Applicability_Surveillance
Requirements.'' The licensee proposes to delete the wording ``. . . (g), except where specific written
relief has been granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'' in TS 4.0.5 a, for the inservice
inspection and testing programs. With the revisions to the Technical Specifications, upon finding an ASME Code requirement
impractical because of prohibitive dose rates or limitations in the design, construction, or system configuration,
the licensee may implement the relief request once it has been submitted to the NRC provided it has been: (1) Acceptably
reviewed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59; (2) approved by the plant staff in accordance with the administrative process described
in the inservice inspection and testing programs administrative procedures; and (3) reviewed and approved by the
Plant Nuclear Safety Committee. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed amendments remove the wording ``. . . (g), except where specific written relief has been
granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'', provided a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation is performed.
The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs are described in the Technical Specifications pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a.
In addition, the proposed amendments, in accordance with NUREG 1431 and draft NUREG 1482, provide relief to the ASME
code requirement in the interim between the time of submittal of a relief request until the NRC has issued a safety evaluation
and granted the relief. The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and do not affect assumptions contained
in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do they affect Technical Specifications
that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Any relief from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require
a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not affect the probability or consequences
of an accident previously analyzed. 

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation
defined in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it
alter the design or operation of plant systems. Any reliefs from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will
require a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and do not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related
activities are performed correctly or the basis for any Technical Specification that is related to the establishment
of or maintenance of a safety margin. Any reliefs from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require
a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-250 and 50-251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County,
Florida 





Date of amendment request: 

April 19, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications by increasing the surveillance
interval specified for air or smoke flow test through the containment spray header from ``at least once per 5 years''
to ``at least once per 10 years.'' The licensee stated that the proposed surveillance interval is consistent with
both Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements
for Testing During Power Operation'' and NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance
Requirements.'' 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed amendments extend the surveillance interval required for performing a qualitative smoke or air flow
test on the containment spray headers. This surveillance test is not designed to track degradation of equipment by
monitoring or trending performance. The air and smoke flow test is a test of the passive design of the containment spray
nozzles, i.e., the testing demonstrates whether or not the nozzles are clogged. A single failure rendering a significant
number of nozzles inoperable as a result of clogging is considered not credible. The changes being proposed do not
affect assumptions contained in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do
they affect Technical Specifications that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously analyzed. 

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed amendments extend the surveillance interval required for performing a qualitative smoke or air flow
test on the containment spray headers. The changes being proposed will not change the physical plant or the modes of
plant operation defined in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment
nor does it alter the design or operation of plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with
the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 

The revised surveillance interval proposed by this submittal will not change or otherwise influence the degree of
operability assumed for the containment spray system in the plant safety analyses. The changes being proposed do
not alter the bases for assurance that safety-related activities are performed correctly or the basis for any Technical
Specification that is related to the establishment of or maintenance of a safety margin. Therefore, operation of
the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County,
New Jersey 





Date of amendment request:

 April 15, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment requests the deletion of the audit program frequency requirements from Technical Specification
(TS) 6.5.3 and to utilize the Operational Quality Assurance (OQA) Plan as the controlling document. This change will
introduce more flexibility into audit scheduling to consider plant activities and performance. In addition, a minor
editorial change has been incorporated correcting a reference in TS 6.5.1.14 in response to a finding in the Operational
Safety Team Inspection report of December 23, 1993. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


GPU Nuclear has determined that this [Technical Specification change request] TSCR poses no significant hazard
as defined by the NRC in 10 CFR 50.92. 





1. These changes do not affect the function of any system or component. Therefore, they do not increase the probability
of occurrence or consequence of an accident previously evaluated in the [Safety Analysis Report] SAR. 

2. These changes do not involve a physical change to plant configuration and they do not affect the performance of any
equipment. Therefore, they do not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously
identified. 

3. The shifting of the audit frequency requirements from the Technical Specifications to the OQA Plan and the extension
of the maximum interval between audits of certain areas do not change the activities to be audited nor the scope of individual
audits. Furthermore, audit frequencies are not associated with the margin of safety in the bases of any Technical
Specification.


Therefore, the margin of safety is not affected by this change.

 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County,
New Jersey 





Date of amendment request:

 April 19, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed change updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent with existing Specifications
1.39 and 4.3.D (ASME Code Section XI, Article 5000 requirements). 

The requested change would delete reference to the ASME Code Section XI, IS-5000 ten year hydrotest inspection
interval and replace this with references to: (1) The Technical Specification 1.39 definition for Reactor Vessel
Pressure Testing, and (2) the Technical Specification 3.3.A.(i) Reactor Vessel Pressure Testing limits (P/T and
250 
 F maximum test temperature). 

The requested change will clarify that the five electromatic relief valves' (EMRV) pressure relief function may
be inoperable or bypassed during system pressure testing required by ASME Code Section XI, Article IWA-5000,
including system leakage and hydrostatic test, with reactor vessel completely solid, core not critical and Technical
Specification 3.2.A (Core Reactivity limits) satisfied. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 





1. The requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of any accident
previously evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to
be consistent with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety
function necessary for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) makes no modification or physical
changes to plant equipment, performance or operation necessary to respond to accidents for the reactor vessel solid,
core not critical condition. 

2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from any accident previously
evaluated because this change: (a) Merely updates and clarifies Technical Specification 3.4.B.1 to be consistent
with other existing Technical Specifications, (b) contains no adverse changes to any existing safety function necessary
for the reactor vessel solid, core not critical condition, and (c) over pressure protection would continue to be provided
by the code safety valves when the EMRV pressure relief function is bypassed. 

3. A significant reduction in margin of safety is not involved because even though the EMRV pressure relief function
is bypassed, over pressure protection would continue to be provided by the code safety valves. Elimination of this
relief function does not affect the reactor safety analysis, since credit was not taken for the EMRV pressure relief
function . . . . 





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

Gulf States Utilities Company, Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, and Entergy Operations, Inc., Docket No. 50-458,
River Bend Station, Unit 1, West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana 





Date of amendment request: 

March 15, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would revise the technical specifications (TS) by removing TS 3/4.3.8, ``Turbine Overspeed
Protection System,'' from the TS and relocating it to an administratively controlled document. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 





Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?


This change request proposes deletion of Technical Specification 3/4.3.8, ``Turbine Overspeed Protection System''
and relocates this requirement to an existing plant program. The purpose of overspeed protection is to minimize the
possible generation of turbine fragment missiles. Excessive overspeed could potentially result in the generation
of missiles which could impact and damage safety related components, equipment or structures, depending on the size
and trajectory of the missiles. The proposed deletion of this specification is based on the low probability of the
generation of a damaging turbine missile and other existing performance verifications of the overspeed protection
system. 

The turbine-generator orientation at RBS [River Bend Station] is a ``favorable'' orientation for reducing the probability
of damage to safety-related equipment from turbine missiles since all safety-related components and structures
are located in the axial direction from the turbine-generator. Turbine Overspeed Protection System is necessary
for protection of the turbine from only an operational and economic point of view. The system is not essential to mitigating
the consequences of an accident. The system is not used in an initial condition of a design basis accident or transient
analysis. The probability of damage to safety-related equipment based on turbine manufacturer's turbine failure
data was calculated to be 1.473 x 10

^8

 per year and is acceptably low based on the probability of turbine failure data of 4.75x10

^7

 per year as recommended by NUREG-0800. Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


The change proposes to relocate this requirement to an existing plant program, whereby adequate control of information
is maintained. The proposed change does not necessitate a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type
of equipment will be installed) or changes to parameters governing normal plant operation. The proposed change will
not impose any different operational or surveillance requirements. No new failure modes are introduced. Therefore,
this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 

The proposed change will not reduce a margin of safety because it has no impact on any safety analysis assumption. The
proposed change does not alter the scope of equipment currently required to be OPERABLE or subject to surveillance
testing, nor does the proposed change affect any instrument setpoints or equipment safety functions. The favorable
orientation of the turbine provides a margin of safety such that the possibility of missile damage to safety-related
equipment is acceptably low. Therefore the change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.






The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Texas 





Date of amendment request:

 April 28, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.3.e to add an option which
will allow the personnel airlock pneumatic system leak test to be completed in 8 hours with a pressure drop of 0.50 psi.
The technical specifications currently require that the door seal pneumatic system be demonstrated operable by
verifying that the system pressure does not decay more than 1.5 psi within 24 hours. The change to an 8-hour test will
expedite return to power following an outage since the test is on the critical path for restart following outages.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in 
the probability or consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated. 
The door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not altered 
except for providing an option to utilize a reduced test 
duration. A conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will be 
assigned to the optional short duration test thus maintaining the 
operability of the pneumatic seal system. The proposed change 
does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously 
evaluated accidents, therefore the consequences of previously 
evaluated accidents are not increased. The probability of an 
accident is also unaffected because the seals are not a potential 
accident initiator. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated. 
With a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi assigned to 
the optional 8 hour door pneumatic seal system pressure drop test 
the capability of the door pneumatic seal system to maintain 65 
psig to the airlock seals, for a minimum of 15 days upon a loss 
of instrument air, is assured. Loss of plant supply air is the 
accident evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis 
Report] section 3.8.2.1.2 and plant specification 2C269SS0006. The proposed change does not create the possibility
of a new or 
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. 
To ensure the pneumatic seal system pressure drop test is not 
compromised, a conservative acceptance criteria of 0.50 psi will 
be assigned to the 8 hour test. With the conservative acceptance 
criteria, the proposed change does not involve a significant 
reduction in the margin of safety previously evaluated.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.

Station, Unit No. 1 Rockingham, New Hampshire 




Date of amendment request: 

January 14, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would change the 
Technical Specifications (TS) to specify the composition of the Station 
Operation Review Committee (SORC) based on experience and expertise vice 
organizational position, to implement a Station Qualified Reviewer Program 
(SQRP), to delete the requirement for periodic procedure reviews, to revise 
the time within which the Nuclear Safety Audit Review Committee (NSARC) 
must issue reports and minutes, and to incorporate a number of editorial 
changes. The editorial changes would delete certain items that are no 
longer applicable, would remove inconsistencies involving the names of 
systems and equipment and NSARC function, composition, and use of 
alternates, and would correct the value for the reactor coolant system 
volume. Other editorial changes would be made for document format 
consistency. The proposed amendment would affect the following TS Sections 
and tables: 1.31, 3.3.3.6, 3.4.1.2, 4.6.3.2, 3.7.1.2, 3/4 10.6, 5.4.2, 
6.3, and 6.4, and Table 4.3-1. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed 
the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC 
staff's review is presented below. 
A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability 
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 
50.92(c)(1)). 
The proposed redefinition of the composition of the SORC would not 
diminish the effectiveness of the SORC and would continue to ensure 
that the SORC has the desired experience and expertise to advise the 
Station Manager on all matters related to nuclear safety. The 
proposed change would permit operational flexibility and eliminate the 
need for an amendment whenever organizational changes occur. 
The proposed SQRP would not reduce the level of procedure review, 
since the SORC continues to retain responsibility to review any 
document requiring an evaluation pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The SQRP 
would be limited to reviewing procedures that do not affect nuclear 
safety. 
Deleting the requirement to periodically review procedures would not 
diminish the review process for procedures since other programmatic 
requirements would continue to assure procedures are reviewed and 
revised when necessary.

The proposed extension of time for preparing and forwarding NSARC 
meeting minutes would not affect safe operation of the facility. 
Significant safety concerns or unreviewed safety questions would still 
be brought to the attention of the Senior Vice President without 
waiting for the release of the NSARC meeting minutes. The change 
would not impede in any manner prompt communication of significant 
concerns to the Senior Vice President. 
The proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is 
operated and do not change any facility design feature or equipment. 
The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic 
requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or 
clarifications. Since there is no change to the facility or operating 
procedures, there is no effect upon the probability or consequences of 
any accident previously analyzed. 
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind 
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 
50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which the 
facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature or 
equipment which affects the operational characteristics of the 
facility. The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic 
requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or 
clarifications. 
C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of 
safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect 
the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or 
features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility. 
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to 
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards 
consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would remove two tables from the Technical Specifications (TS) which list reactor trip system
(RTS) instrumentation response times and engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS) instrumentation
response times. These tables will be placed in the Millstone 3 Technical Requirements Manual. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes would not:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes to remove the RTS and ESFAS response times from the Technical Specifications will not affect
the operation of the RTS and ESFAS. Operability and surveillance requirements are still maintained in the Technical
Specifications and the response times will be included and maintained in the plant operating procedures. A safety
evaluation and PORC [Plant Operations Review Committee] review will be required for the limits to be changed. Since
the systems will not be affected by the proposed changes, there is no impact on the performance of these systems or the
consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously evaluated. 

There are no new failure modes associated with the proposed 
changes. Since the plant will continue to operate as designed, 
the proposed changes will not modify the plant response to the 
point where it can be considered a new accident. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the 
protective boundaries nor do they affect the consequences of any 
accident previously analyzed. The Technical Specification 
operability and surveillance requirements will still ensure that 
the systems are tested and within the limits. Changing the 
limits requires a safety evaluation and PORC review which will 
ensure that the licensing basis is maintained. Therefore, the 
proposed changes will not impact the margin of safety as defined 
in the basis of any Technical Specification. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are

Date of amendment request:

 April 22, 1994. 



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would delete the 
requirements regarding the condenser air ejector monitor from Tables 3.3-12 
and 4.3-12 of the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specifications. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

The proposed technical specification change has been reviewed against 
the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, and it has been determined not to involve 
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). Specifically, the proposed 
change does not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously analyzed. 

Deleting the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
condenser air ejector monitor from Tables 3.3-12 and 4.3-12 of 
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications would leave the 
steam generator blowdown monitor as the primary method of 
monitoring and isolating steam generator blowdown. The proposed 
license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the operation 
of Millstone Unit No. 2, because it requires the use of a single 
monitor, the steam generator blowdown monitor, to meet the 
requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3-12). 

While NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] is proposing to 
delete the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
condenser air ejector monitor from the Millstone Unit No. 2 
Technical Specifications, there are no plans to change any of the 
design features or functions or the condenser air ejector 
monitor, or any of the specified surveillances or frequency for 
such surveillances. The condenser air ejector monitor will 
continue to isolate blowdown upon a high radiation alarm. 

Additionally, steam generator blowdown isolation is required to 
ensure compliance with 10 CFR 20. It is not required to ensure 
compliance with 10 CFR 100. Therefore, the condenser air ejector 
monitor does not perform any safety function. The condenser air 
ejector monitor is not safety related. It is not credited in any 
radiological consequence calculations presented in the Millstone 
Unit No. 2 FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. 

Based on the above, this proposed license amendment does not 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
form any accident previously evaluated. 


The proposed license amendment does not involve any physical 
changes to plant equipment or any changes to plant procedures 
that would be a precursor to an accident. NNECO has no plans to 
change any of the specified surveillances or frequency for such 
surveillances. The condenser air ejector monitor will continue 
to isolate blowdown upon a high radiation alarm. Also, the 
proposed license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the 
operation of Millstone Unit No. 2 because it requires the use of 
a single monitor, the steam generator blowdown monitor, to meet 
the requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3-12). Therefore, this proposed license 
amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different 
kind of accident form any accident previously evaluated. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Deleting the operability and surveillance requirements for the 
condenser air ejector monitor from Tables 3.3-12 and 4.3-12 of 
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications would leave the 
steam generator blowdown monitor as the primary method of 
monitoring and isolating steam generator blowdown. The proposed 
license amendment imposes stricter limitations on the operation 
of Millstone Unit No. 2, because it requires the use of a single 
monitor, the steam generator blowdown monitor, to meet the 
requirements of Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification 
3.3.3.9 (Table 3.3-12). Therefore, this proposed license 
amendment does not impact or reduce the margin of safety. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are

measurement range of 10

^1

-10

4

 counts per second (CPS) for the entry 
regarding the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor.'' Also the 
amendment would correct a few typographical and editorial errors on page V 
of the Index for the Millstone Unit 2 Technical Specifications. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

NNECO [Northeast Nuclear Energy Company] has reviewed the proposed 
changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.90 and has concluded that the 
changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The 
basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c) 
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC 
because the changes would not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously analyzed. 

NNECO's proposal to eliminate the CPS scale for the ``Wide Range 
Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' entry in Millstone Unit No. 2 
Technical Specification Table 3.3-9 will not affect the ability 
of Millstone Unit No. 2 to meet the intent and purpose of panel 
C-21's original design. 

The 10

^8

% to 100% power scale overlaps the CPS scale. The range 
of 10

^8

% to 100% power for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron 
Flux Monitor'' is adequate to permit the operators to bring the 
unit to hot shutdown from outside the control room. Also, the 
instruments on C-21 are not used to provide the start-up rate 
signal during start-up or refueling operations. This proposed 
license amendment does not impact the performance of any safety-related component, system, or structure. 

A review of the original design drawings concluded that this 
proposed change is consistent with the original plant design, and 
reflects the actual as-built condition of the unit. The original 
design drawings show that the wide range logarithmic neutron flux 
indicators only receive a percent power signal. 

NNECO's proposals to rectify a few typographical and editorial 
errors on page V of the Index for the Millstone Unit No. 2 
Technical Specifications are administrative in nature. They 
ensure that the Index accurately reflects the contents of the 
technical specifications. 

Based on the above, the proposed license amendment does not 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously analyzed. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any previously analyzed. 

The proposed license amendment does not impact the performance of 
any safety-related component, system, or structure. Panel C-21 
is required to permit the operators to bring the unit to a hot 
shutdown condition from a location outside the control room. 
Deleting the CPS range for the ``Wide Range Logarithmic Neutron 
Flux Monitor'' does not affect the ability of the operators to 
accomplish this function. Also, the proposed change is 
consistent with the original design of the plant. The proposed 
license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident form any previously analyzed. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

NNECO's proposal to eliminate the CPS scale for the wide range 
logarithmic neutron flux monitors will not affect the ability of 
Millstone Unit No. 2 to meet the intent and purpose of panel C-21's original design. The 10

^8

% to 100% power scale overlaps the 
CPS scale. The range of 10

^8

% to 100% power for the ``Wide Range 
Logarithmic Neutron Flux Monitor'' is adequate to permit the 
operators to bring the unit to hot shutdown from outside of the 
control room. Also, the instruments on C-21 are not used to 
provide the start-up rate signal during start-up or refueling 
operations. This proposed license amendment does not impact the 
performance of any safety-related component, system, or 
structure. 

Therefore, this proposed license amendment does not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this

Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50-336, Millstone 
Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, New London County, Connecticut 





Date of amendment request:

 April 25, 1994.



Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment would change the 
Technical Specifications concerning four related issues: (1) Power-operated 
relief valve (PORV) and block valve reliability; (2) low-temperature 
overpressure protection (LTOP); (3) boron dilution; and (4) shutdown risk 
management. Specifically, the proposed amendment would revise Technical 
Specifications 3.4.3 and 3.4.9.3 to address the issues specifically raised 
in Generic Letter (GL) 90-06. Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 
3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.9.1, 3.5.3, 
4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.1.2.4, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.3.1., 4.4.3.2, 4.4.9.3.1, 
4.4.9.3.2, 4.5.3.2 and 4.9.8.1 would be revised to provide consistency with 
the proposed changes in GL 90-06 or are related to the boron dilution issue 
or shutdown risk management philosophies. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards 
consideration] because the changes would not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence 
of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes address the operability and surveillance requirements for the charging pump, HPSI [high-pressure
safety injection] pumps, reactor coolant pumps, safety valves, PORVs, block valves, and the LTOP, boron dilution
and SDC [shutdown cooling] systems. These changes were proposed to address four main issues: to reflect the guidance
of GL 90-06 with respect to PORV and cold overpressure; to address boron dilution concerns; to address shutdown
risk management lessons learned; and to address recent information on cold overpressure mitigation concerns. Generally,
the changes are more restrictive than present requirements and are consistent with the recommendations of GL 90-06.
Also, the changes provide the operator with additional guidance that was not previously available. Therefore, the
changes will not impact the probability of occurrence or consequences of an LTOP event, boron dilution event, loss
of shutdown cooling, or other event requiring emergency core cooling which has been previously analyzed. 


PORV Requirements 


The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.3 have been made to be consistent with GL 90-06. One enhancement
has been made to the guidance contained in GL 90-06 and that was to replace the phrase ``because of excessive seat
leakage'' with the phrase ``and capable of being manually cycled.'' Although the PORV may be designated inoperable,
it may be able to be manually opened and closed and in this manner can be used to mitigate transients. For example, PORV
inoperability may be due to seat leakage, instrumentation problems, automatic control problems, or other causes
that do not prevent manual use and do not create a possibility for a small break LOCA. The wording changes are meant to
be more specific while meeting the intent of GL 90-06. The additional enhancement to GL 90-06 includes
Surveillance Requirement 4.4.3.1c whereby Millstone Unit No. 2 proposed to bench test the PORVs at a qualified laboratory
under conditions representative of Mode 3 or 4 conditions. We believe this off site test will result in safer plant
conditions than the in situ test proposed in the generic letter. The remaining changes to Technical Specification
3.4.3 incorporate the guidance contained in GL 90-06 and do not significantly increase the probability or consequence
of an LTOP event or the failure of the PORV to operate as required. 


Cold Overpressurization Protection 


Changes are being proposed to Technical Specification sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1, 3.4.3, 3.4.9.1,
3.4.9.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.3.1, 4.4.3.2, 4.4.9.3.1, 4.4.9.3.2, and 4.5.3.2 to incorporate the guidance
of GL 90-06 as well as enhance the availability of equipment to reduce the shutdown risk while still satisfying
the cold overpressure requirements. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.2.1 and 3.1.2.3 will ensure only one charging pump and one HPSI
pump are operable in Mode 5 or 6 with the reactor vessel head on with an available vent of less than 2.8 square inches.
The remaining pumps will be secured. These proposed changes have been made to ensure Millstone Unit No. 2 does not create
an LTOP condition by the operation of too many pumps injecting fluid, thereby increasing pressure in a low-temperature
condition. These proposed modifications are consistent with Technical Specification 3.5.3 which has also been
modified and will decrease the possibility of an LTOP condition from occurring. 
The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.4.2.1 will ensure consistency between this technical specification
and Technical Specification 3.4.9.3. The safety valves at Millstone Unit No. 2 are not used for LTOP mitigation. The
PORVs, or RCS [reactor coolant system] vent at Millstone Unit No. 2 are used to mitigate an LTOP condition. Safety valves
are required to be operable during operating conditions to automatically reduce system pressures. The use of the
PORV, which allows manual control, for mitigation of an LTOP event, reduces the severity and consequence of a potential
overpressure event by giving the operators more control. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3/4.9.3 provide enhanced operational flexibility through the
use of a PORV or RCS vent. The APPLICABILITY statement has been changed for clarification purposes with no change in
intent and safety implications. The ACTION requirements for the LTOP system include a 7-day allowable outage time
(AOT) to restore an inoperable LTOP channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken.
In addition, new Action Statement `f' states that the provisions of Specification 3.0.4 are not applicable. Therefore,
the unit may enter the Modes for which the LCO apply, during a unit shutdown or placement of the head on the reactor vessel
following refueling, when an LTOP channel is inoperable. In this situation, the 7-day AOT applies for restoring the
channel to operable status before other remedial measures would have to be taken. This is the same manner in which the
ACTION requirements apply when an LTOP channel is determined to be inoperable while the plant is in a Mode for which
the LTOP system is required to be operable. 
Specifications 3.4.1.4 and 3.4.9.1 have been revised to address concerns identified in an NRC Information Notice
regarding previously unconsidered pressure drops across the reactor. The modifications to these two technical
specifications will ensure that unanticipated pressure rises do not occur and that there will be no increase in the
probability or consequences of the LTOP event. 
Based on the evaluation done in support of resolution to GL 90-06 regarding the LTOP system unavailability,
NNECO concludes that additional restrictions on operation with an inoperable LTOP channel are warranted when the
potential for a low-temperature overpressure event is the highest, and especially when the unit is in a water-solid
condition. It is also concluded that these additional measures emphasize the importance of the LTOP system, especially
while operating in a water-solid condition as the primary success path for the mitigation of overpressure transients
during low-temperature operation. Therefore, these enhancements will not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated. 


Boron Dilution 


Changes are being proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3,
4.1.2.3, and 4.1.2.4 to provide added assurance that the boron dilution analysis remains bounding while allowing
lower flow rates to reduce the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing at mid-loop operation. 
The changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.3, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.1.2.4,
and 4.9.8.1 will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident. Tagging out of a charging
pump, increasing shutdown margin, and reducing SDC flow will impact results of the boron dilution accident, but will
not increase the probability of initiating events. 
An increase in the shutdown margin requirement as was done in Technical Specifications 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.8 will assure
consistency with the Core Operating Limits Report which provided additional margin in a boron dilution event.

Shutdown Risk 


The changes proposed to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, 3.5.3, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.3, 4.5.3.2
and 4.9.8.1 have been optimized to take into account shutdown risk concerns. Lower shutdown cooling flow rates are
allowed to minimize the potential of a loss of shutdown cooling due to vortexing during RCS mid-loop operation. 
The availability of injection sources in the shutdown modes have been optimized while still meeting the cold overpressurization
requirements. 
To address shutdown risk issues, the method to secure an inoperable HPSI pump has been modified. Previously, disconnecting
the motor circuit breaker from its electrical power circuit was the only acceptable method of isolating this pump.
Additional methods of isolating the pump have been added with the key locking of a discharge valve downstream of the
HPSI pump and the tagging the valve. These actions from the control room will allow the operator the ability to quickly
restore water flow and reduce the risk associated with having equipment out of service while shutdown. Inadvertent
actuation is prevented by requiring the operator to obtain the key to open this discharge valve from the shift supervisor.
The opening of this valve would, therefore, require the actions of two knowledgeable individuals, the operator,
and the shift supervisor. The limitation on the amount of pumps available is as a direct result of LTOP concerns. This
provides assurance that the LTOP requirements are met while maintaining the maximum available equipment to mitigate
shutdown risk concerns. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.1.1.3, 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.2, 3.1.2.4, 3.1.2.8, 3.4.1.4, 3.4.2.1,
3.4.9.1, 4.1.1.3, 4.1.2.4, and 4.9.8.1 do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously analyzed. The proposed changes provide clarification or additional restrictions for plant personnel
concerning the operation of charging pumps, HPSI pumps, PORVs, blocking valves, and the SDC, boron dilution, and
LTOP systems. The proposed technical specification changes do not introduce significant changes in the manner in
which the plant is being operated. Therefore, no new failure modes are being introduced, and the potential for an unanalyzed
accident is not created. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications 3.4.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different
type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant. In addition, plant operations
are only being altered enough to allow a block valve and PORV to be placed in conditions which allow them to better perform
their safety functions. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.4.9.3 do not create the possibility of an accident of a different
type than previously evaluated, since there is no change to the design of the plant and the way the plant is operated.

The proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.1.2.3 and 3.5.3 allow for the isolation of an inoperable HPSI pump
by the key lock closing of a valve at the discharge of the HPSI pump and the safety tagging in the closed position. This
isolation is required so that a LTOP condition does not occur. This method of isolation is required so that a LTOP condition
does not occur. This method of isolation is acceptable and will not create a new or different kind of accident since
it is not possible to inadvertently open this valve. A deliberate action is required by the operator, with the concurrence
of the shift supervisor, to obtain the key and open the valve. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes will not have an adverse impact on the protection boundaries. 
With regard to the GL 90-06 modifications, there is no degradation in the operability and surveillance requirements
for the PORVs and block valves and the LTOP systems. There will be no change in actual practice for, or resulting performance
of, these systems. All other changes are proposed mainly to clarify each requirement. For Modes 1, 2, and 3, safety-related
overpressure protection is provided by the pressurizer code safety relief valves. Therefore, there will be no adverse
impact on the margin of safety as defined in the bases of any technical specification. Although any two charging pumps
are allowed to be operable in a shutdown condition, the flow of these pumps is consistent with the assumptions of the
boron dilution analysis. Additional pumping capability is being provided to address shutdown risk concerns, however,
the limitation on pumping is tied to the vent path that is available. This will ensure that the margin of safety is not
impacted. 
The combined effects of reducing SDC flow, tagging out a charging pump, and increasing shutdown margin is that the
required operator response times of 15 minutes in Modes 4 and 5, and 30 minutes in Mode 6 are maintained. 
By reducing the allowed SDC flow rate to less than that where vortexing can occur, the potential for a loss of SDC event
is being reduced. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety for the boron dilution and shutdown cooling
events. 
The proposed changes associated with the cold overpressure mitigation system will ensure the appropriate margin
of safety is maintained by limiting RCP operation in Mode 5 and limit RCS cooldown rates. These actions will ensure
an LTOP condition does not occur.

Description of amendment request:

 This amendment will delete the frequency requirements for a number of audits listed under Technical Specification
(TS) 6.5.2.8 for each unit. The proposed change also includes removing the audit requirements for the Emergency Plan
and the Security Plan from the TS and relocating these requirements to each of the respective plans. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan
and Security Plan from Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and neither directly increase or decrease
the likelihood that an accident will occur. The Technical Specification changes will not impact the function or method
of operation of plant systems, structures, or components. Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important
to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR is not increased by the changes. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed
changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed 
audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan 
from Technical Specifications are administrative in nature and do 
not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. The 
proposed changes do not affect systems, structures, or components

III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin

The proposed Technical Specification changes to delete prescribed 
audit frequencies and remove the Emergency Plan and Security Plan 
from Technical Specifications do not involve any reductions in 
the margin of safety. The proposed changes will enable more 
effective resource utilization through performance based 
scheduling of audits in the affected areas. Using performance 
indicators and other measures of program effectiveness, potential 
problems can be more readily identified and audit resources can 
be applied to these areas to enhance performance. The proposed 
performance based audit process will maintain or enhance the 
margin of safety in the areas audited.

Date of amendment request: 

March 28, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed modification to Technical Specification (TS) Section 4.8.4.3.a, would increase the surveillance
interval for the functional test of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). The increase would be from every six (6) months
to each time the plant is in cold shutdown for a period of 24 hours, unless the test was performed in 
the previous six months. This change is based on guidance provided in 
Generic Letter 91-09, ``Modification Of Surveillance Interval For The 
Electrical Protective Assemblies In Power Supplies For The Reactor 
Protection System.'' 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed Technical Specification changes do not involve a 
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. 

The Reactor Protection System equipment subject to the proposed 
Technical Specifications changes are not accident initiators. 

The Electrical Protective Assemblies (EPAs) specified by these 
proposed changes are not required to actuate in order to mitigate 
an accident. The functional test methodology of the RPS 
electrical power monitoring channels will not be effected by the 
proposed change in test frequency. The design and function of 
the EPAs will not be altered and will perform as originally 
designed. 

A review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays 
surveillance test history results was performed and supports the 
proposed TS changes to extend the testing interval. Fifty-one 
(51) surveillance tests were reviewed, and all the as-found 
channel calibration results were within the required TS limits. 
There were identified deficiencies in four (4) of the fifty-one 
tests performed, however, these four deficiencies did not affect 
the operability of the RPS EPAs. Based on good historical 
surveillance test results, we have concluded that the reliability 
of the equipment is not expected to degrade during the proposed 
extended test interval. Furthermore, the proposed reduced 
testing will result in a net decrease in the probability of 
occurrence of a malfunction of equipment important to safety. 
These malfunctions would cause an invalid inadvertent trip of the 
RPS which would impose unnecessary challenges on the affected 
unit at power. The guidance set forth in Generic Letter 91-09 
states ``The staff concludes that the benefit to safety of 
reducing the frequency of testing during power operations more 
than offsets the risk to safety from relaxing the surveillance 
requirement to test the EPAs during power operation.'' 

Since the RPS EPAs are not accident initiators, and the design 
and function of the equipment will not be affected by the 
proposed TS changes, and the reliability of the equipment is not 
expected to degrade during the extended test interval, and the 
changes would reduce the probability of unnecessary challenges to 
the affected unit, we have concluded that the proposed changes do 
not involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or 
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The design and function of the RPS EPAs will not be affected by 
the proposed TS changes. The failure modes of the existing 
equipment will remain unchanged, and no new accident types will 
be created. The RPS electrical power monitoring channels' 
functional test methodology will not be affected by the proposed 
change in test frequency. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do 
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in 
a margin of safety. 

Based on a review of the RPS electrical power monitoring relays 
surveillance test history results we have concluded that the 
reliability of the equipment is not expected to degrade during 
the proposed extended test interval. In addition, the benefit to 
safety by reducing the frequency of testing during power 
operation and the attendant possible challenges to safety systems 
more than offsets any risk to safety from relaxing the 
surveillance requirements to test the EPAs during power 
operation. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a 
significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick Generating 
Station, Unit 1, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania 





Date of application for amendment: 

May 6, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would revise Unit 1 
Technical Specifications, Section 5.5.3, ``Capacity,'' to permit an interim 
increase in the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 Spent Fuel Pool 
(SFP) from 2040 fuel assemblies to 2500 fuel assemblies. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:




1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 Spent 
Fuel Pool (SFP) from 2040 fuel assemblies to 2500 fuel assemblies 
does not increase the probability of occurrence of an accident. 
Since all fuel handling activities will be performed using 
approved procedures and compatible equipment, the probability of 
a fuel handling accident occurring is unchanged. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to 
2500 fuel assemblies will facilitate storing 1940 spent fuel 
assemblies (including contingency) that have been discharged from 
LGS, Units 1 and 2, and 560 low exposure fuel assemblies shipped 
to LGS from the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station. The decay heat 
load associated with the entire Shoreham fuel inventory is 
insignificant, since it equates to less than 5% of the heat load 
generated from one (1) recently discharged full power fuel 
bundle. Therefore, the actual decay heat load to the Unit 1 SFP 
will be equivalent to that which is generated from storing the 
1940 spent fuel assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP to 
accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies, as proposed in 
this TS Change Request, is bounded by the existing analysis 
supporting the storage of spent fuel at LGS. The existing 
analysis considers design inputs for structural integrity, 
criticality, and thermal-hydraulics and is based on the storage 
of 2862 spent fuel assemblies. As documented in Section 9.1.3, 
``Spent Fuel Pool Cooling and Cleanup Systems,'' of Supplement 2 of 
the NRC's Safety Evaluation Report, i.e., NUREG-0991, ``Safety 
Evaluation Report Related to the Operation of Limerick Generating 
Station, Units 1 and 2,'' the NRC indicated that based on its 
independent analysis the heat removal capability of the Fuel Pool 
Cooling and Cleanup (FPCC) system could only support 2484 spent 
fuel assemblies. However, the LGS, Unit 1 TS currently limit the 
storage of spent fuel to 2040 spent fuel assemblies. Since the 
decay heat load from the Shoreham fuel inventory (i.e., 560 fuel 
assemblies) is insignificant, the actual heat load to the Unit 1 
SFP will be equivalent to that generated from 1940 fuel 
assemblies discharged from LGS, Units 1 and 2, which is less than 
the limit currently specified [in] the TS (i.e., 2040 fuel 
assemblies). 

Relocating six (6) of the existing Unit 2 spent fuel storage 
racks to the Unit 1 SFP will be conducted in accordance with PECO 
Energy's Heavy Loads Program which was developed in order to 
implement the guidance delineated in NUREG-0612, ``Control of 
Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' such that the likelihood of 
a heavy load drop is precluded. The Unit 2 spent fuel storage 
racks are identical to those already in use in the Unit 1 SFP. 
Procedures will be in place to ensure that the Unit 2 spent fuel 
storage racks are situated in the Unit 1 SFP to insure [ensure] 
proper neutron poison alignment with the existing Unit 1 racks. 
The existing spent fuel storage racks are designed for rack-to-rack contact during design basis events without the
loss of 
structural integrity. The racks are also designed to withstand 
the impact from a dropped fuel assembly without the loss of 
structural integrity or be damaged in a way that could adversely 
affect the criticality analysis. Increasing the spent fuel 
storage capacity to accommodate the storage of 2500 spent fuel 
assemblies will not affect the spent fuel storage racks since the 
racks are specifically designed to safely store spent fuel. 

This proposed TS change will not prevent the ability of the FPCC 
system from performing its design function to adequately cool the 
SFP. The FPCC system will continue to function normally and be 
capable of maintaining the SFP temperature at or below 140 
 F. 
The backup cooling and makeup systems (i.e., Residual Heat 
Removal (RHR), Emergency Service Water (ESW), and Residual Heat 
Removal Service Water (RHRSW) systems) will continue to function 
as designed to provide an alternate source of cooling and makeup 
water to ensure SFP cooling is maintained. The RHR system is 
still capable of maintaining the SFP temperature less than 140 
 F 
as described in LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). 
Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will 
not increase the probability of a loss of fuel pool cooling 
accident or adversely affect the Refuel Floor ventilation system. 

The consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident as described in the 
LGS UFSAR are not increased since the number of fuel assemblies 
stored in a SFP is not an input to the initial conditions of the 
accident evaluation. This accident evaluates the dropping of a 
spent fuel assembly and the fuel grapple assembly into the 
reactor core during refueling operations. A drop height of 32 
feet for the spent fuel assembly and 47 feet for the fuel grapple 
assembly are assumed and will produce the largest number of 
failed fuel rods. Since the maximum possible height a fuel 
assembly can be dropped over the SFP does not exceed 32 feet, the 
consequences of a Fuel Handling Accident will not be increased by 
increasing the number of fuel storage cells. 

The consequences of a loss of fuel pool cooling as described in 
Section 9.1.3.6 of the LGS UFSAR will not be increased. The 
event described in the UFSAR assumes that the iodine in the fuel 
from past refuelings is negligible, due to the long decay time. 
Iodine is the major contributor to thyroid dose. Since the 
iodine in the fuel from past refuelings is negligible, due to the 
long decay time, increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will 
not increase the dose due to the release of iodine in the SFP 
water resulting from boiling and therefore, the consequences are 
not increased.

Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP, on an interim basis, will not increase the probability of a malfunction
of the stored spent fuel since the existing thermal-hydraulic analysis confirms that sufficient cooling capability
exists to accommodate the storage of 2500 fuel assemblies in the Unit 1 SFP. As for fuel criticality, the existing analysis
also confirms that the stored fuel assemblies will remain sub-critical under normal and abnormal conditions. 

Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the SFP structure
or SFP liner. The existing structural analysis confirms that the SFP structure has adequate margin to prevent overstressing
and meets the code requirements. Increasing the storage capacity in the Unit 1 SFP will not increase the probability
of a malfunction of the spent fuel storage racks during design basis events based on the existing seismic/structural
analysis. 

Increasing the on-site spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the probability of a malfunction of the FPCC
system. The FPCC system will continue to function as designed. 

The probability of a malfunction of fuel handling equipment will not be increased since increasing the storage capacity
in the Unit 1 SFP, as proposed, does not affect fuel handling equipment. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity does not increase the consequences of a spent fuel assembly failure since
the failure of one (1) assembly will not result in additional spent fuel assembly failures. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of spent fuel storage rack failure,
since the existing racks have been designed/qualified to limit the consequences of a failure. A failure of, or damage
to one (1) storage rack, will not result in failure or damage to another storage rack. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity will not increase the consequences of the failure of fuel handling equipment
since the maximum expected number of fuel rods damaged by a fuel handling equipment failure remains as evaluated in
the LGS UFSAR. 

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

Increasing the spent fuel storage capacity in the LGS Unit 1 SFP to permit an interim increase from 2040 fuel assemblies
to 2500 fuel assemblies will not create the possibility of an accident of a different type. The Unit 1 SFP has been analyzed
for criticality effects, structural effects, radiological effects, and thermal-hydraulic effects. The increase
in spent fuel storage capacity will be achieved by relocating six (6) existing spent fuel storage racks from the Unit
2 SFP to the Unit 1 SFP. The spent fuel storage racks are of identical design and are passive components; therefore,
the possibility of creating a new accident does not exist. 

No new operating schemes or active equipment types will be required to store additional fuel bundles in the SFP. Therefore,
the possibility of a different type of malfunction occurring is not created. 

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. 

3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Since the existing TS limits for fuel handling interlocks, heavy loads restrictions, water coverage over irradiated
fuel, in-core decay time, and fuel sub-criticality will be maintained, the margin of safety will not be reduced. 

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

there are three or more inoperable control rods or if there is one fully or partially withdrawn rod which cannot be moved
and for which control rod drive mechanism damage has not been ruled out, (4) revise TS 4.4.A.2 to allow for the replacement
charge on the explosive valve for the standby liquid control system to be from either the same manufactured batch as
the one fired or another batch which has been certified by having one of the batches successfully fired, (5) revise
the frequency in TS 4.4.B.3 to functionally test each standby liquid control system pump loop from monthly to at least
once per 92 days. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 


1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed changes do not alter the operation of equipment assumed to be an initiator of any analyzed
event or assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative
in nature. Proposed change 3 to reduce the requirement to verify insertion capability from every 24 hours to a single
verification when one or more control rods are stuck is sufficient to verify that the problem is not generic while providing
the benefit of removing a very resource intensive requirement and permits licensed operators to focus on other, more
safety significant actions. Proposed change 4 will continue to provide the necessary assurance that replacement
charges on the explosive valve of the standby liquid control system will be from a batch from which a sample charge has
been tested satisfactorily. Proposed change 5 modifies the allowable interval between surveillance tests for the
standby liquid control system without reducing the reliability of the system while providing the benefit of reduced
wear and tear on the system. Therefore, these proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components. The proposed changes do not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore,
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated is not created. 

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes do
not affect the manner in which the facility is operated or change equipment or features which affect the operational
characteristics of the facility. Proposed changes 1 and 2 are administrative in nature. Proposed change 3 maintains
the assurance that when a scram is required that, at a minimum, the assumptions used in the accident analysis will be
met. Additionally, if the initial check of control rod insertion is satisfactory, the subsequent checks are not likely
to identify similar problems because operating experience shows that a [stuck] rod is rare. Once it has been determined
that the same problem is not occurring in other control rods the normal surveillance frequency is sufficient to verify
that scram capability is maintained. Proposed change 4 provides added flexibility for providing replacement [charges]
from any batch that has had a charge successfully fired. Proposed change 4 adds flexibility while maintaining the
firing reliability in excess of 99.99% for the explosive valves on the standby liquid control system. Proposed change
5 does not impact any safety analysis assumptions because the frequency of testing is not assumed in any safety analysis
and standby liquid control system operability is maintained. In addition, the test frequency reduction provides
reduced wear and tear on the system and increased system reliability. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego
County, New York 




Date of amendment request: 

December 20, 1989, as supplemented January 16, 1990, January 3, 1992, January 30, 1992, May 5, 1993, May 26, 1993, and
March 2, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

This application for an amendment to the James A. FitzPatrick Technical Specifications proposes new Safety/Relief
Valve (SRV) performance limits to take credit for the currently installed SRV capacity. Specifically, three changes
to the existing SRV performance limits are proposed: 
 The first permits continued plant operation with two SRVs out-ofservice. Since 7 of the 11 SRVs at FitzPatrick
are also automatic depressurization system (ADS) valves, this reduces the number of ADS valves required to be operable
to 5. Current specifications permit only one SRV out-of-service for 30 days. 
 Secondly, the setpoints for all 11 SRVs are changed to a single nominal setpoint. Current specifications stagger
the setpoints from 1090 to 1140 psig. 
 The third change increases the maximum permissible setpoint tolerance 
from one to three percent. 
The new Limiting Safety System Setting (LSSS) for reactor coolant system overpressurization protection (TS 2.2.1.B),
as a result of these changes, now requires that 9 of 11 SRVs be operable at a common setpoint of 1110 psig plus or minus
3 percent. 
Safety analyses were performed, using a conservative SRV setpoint of 1195 psig, which demonstrate that these proposed
changes are acceptable. 
Other changes, not associated with SRV performance, clarify selected portions of the Technical Specifications
and correct minor typographical and editorial errors. 
This ``Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing''
(Notice) supersedes the related Notice which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 15, 1990 (55 FR 20228). 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Operation of the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant hazards consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since it would not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. A bounding
analysis (NEDC-31697P, ``Updated SRV Performance Requirements for the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power
Plant'') of the revised SRV performance requirements considered plant operation with 9 of 11 SRVs operable and with
a common valve actuation pressure of 1195 psig. The analysis demonstrates that a 50 psi margin exists between the maximum
anticipated pressure and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code upset reactor vessel pressure
limit of 1375 psig. The analyses of NEDC-31697P also demonstrate that the new SRV performance limits have no
significant impact on thermal limits, ECCS/LOCA performance, HPCI/RCIC operability, containment response, containment
integrity, or 10 CFR [Part] 50 Appendix R alternate shutdown capability. The analyses also considered simmer margin
and downward setpoint drift.
The five miscellaneous changes clarify terminology, correct typographical errors, remove a surveillance requirement
which should have been deleted as part of Amendment 130, clarify when SRV manual actuation is performed, and delete
a duplicate specification. These changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not impact previously
evaluated accidents or equipment malfunctions. 
2. Ccreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. The new SRV performance
limits are primarily administrative changes. The only physical changes involve recalibration of SRV setpoints
and operation with 2 SRVs/ADS valves out-of-service. The operation and function of the pressure relief system and
[are] unaffected. No new failure modes are introduced. 
The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and, as such, do not create the possibility
of an accident or malfunction. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The new SRV performance limits slightly reduce the existing
margin to vessel overpressure and the margin to the 125% mechanical overspeed trip for the HPCI and RCIC turbines.
However, the reduction in the overpressure margin is insignificant (approximately 25 psi) and the plant's response
to transients and accidents remains well within the limits established in General Design Criteria (GDC) 15, Standard
Review Plan Section 5.2.2, and FSAR Section 4.4. The reduction in turbine overspeed margin is negligible (less than
1%), because it is within the allowable tolerance of the trip settings. 
The proposed miscellaneous changes are purely administrative in nature and do not involve a reduction in safety margin.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 18, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would relocate the fire protection requirements of Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.14
and 4.12, and fire brigade staffing and training requirements of TSs 6.2.2(f) and 6.4.2 from the TSs to administratively-controlled
operational specifications. Specifically, the proposed changes would add the NRC standard fire protection license
condition to the Operating License, update the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) to include the Fire Protection
Program by reference, and relocate the fire protection requirements from the TSs to the Indian Point 3 Operational
Specifications Manual. The proposed changes have been developed in accordance with the guidance contained in NRC
Generic Letter (GL) 86-10, ``Implementation of Fire Protection Requirements,'' and GL 88-12, ``Removal
of Fire Protection Requirements from the Technical Specifications.'' 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information: 




(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated? 


Response


This change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection program elements from the Technical Specifications
to the Operational Specifications and the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. No reduction in content is being made
to the Technical Specification requirements that are being relocated. Operating limitations will continue to be
imposed, and required surveillances will continue to be performed in accordance with written procedures and instructions
auditable by the NRC.
Although future proposed changes to the fire protection program elements previously located in the Technical Specifications
will no longer be controlled by 10 CFR 50.90, proposed changes to the Fire Protection requirements relocated to the
Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures. 
Thus, programmatic controls will continue to assure that future proposed fire protection program changes will not
create an unreviewed safety question. 
(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated? 


Response


The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the safety analysis
report is not created. 
This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection Technical Specification requirements from the Technical
Specifications to the Operational Specifications. No reduction to the fire protection Technical Specification
requirements is being made and thus the change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from those
previously evaluated. 
As noted above, future changes to the requirements in the Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative
procedures. 
(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 


Response: 


The margin of safety as defined in the bases for any technical specification is not reduced. 
This proposed amendment does not involve a reduction to the approved fire protection program or Fire Protection Technical
Specification requirements. The Technical Specification fire protection requirements are being relocated, with
no reduction in content, to the Operational Specifications. Since there is no reduction in the requirements, there
is no reduction in the margin of safety. 
As noted above, proposed changes to the Fire Protection Technical Specification requirements relocated to the Operational
Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311, Salem 
Nuclear Generating Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey 




Date of amendment request:

 April 12, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 This amendment request would revise the 
Emergency Diesel Generator hot restart test by separating it from the 
24-hour endurance run and from the load sequence testing. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

 

(1) Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 
The proposed changes would revise the Salem Emergency Diesel 
Generator (EDG) surveillance criteria to allow the hot restart 
test to be performed independent of the Engineered Safety 
Features (ESF) load sequencing test and the 24-hour endurance 
run. The proposed surveillance requirements would continue to 
demonstrate that the objectives of each of these tests are met. 
Specifically, the EDG's are shown to be capable of starting the 
ESF loads in the required sequence, operating at full load for an 
extended period of time, and restarting from a full load 
temperature condition. Therefore, the proposed changes would not 
adversely affect the EDG's ability to support mitigation of the 
consequences of any previously evaluated accident. The proposed 
changes to the surveillance requirements do not affect the 
initiation or progression of any accident sequence. 
(2) Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of 
accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed change affects surveillance test criteria such that 
increased scheduling flexibility is allowed while the test 
objectives associated with demonstrating EDG operability continue 
to be met. The proposed changes do not allow any plant 
configurations that are presently prohibited by the Salem 
Technical Specifications. 
(3) Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of 
safety. 
Surveillance testing per the proposed Technical 
Specifications would continue to demonstrate the ability of 
the EDG's to perform their intended function of providing 
electrical power to ESF systems needed to mitigate design 
basis transients, consistent with the plant safety analyses. 
The margin of safety demonstrated by the plant safety 
analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed change. 
Therefore, [Public Service Electric and Gas Company] PSE&G has 
concluded that the changes proposed herein do not involve a 
Significant Hazards Consideration.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the 
amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Southern California Edison Company, et al., Docket No. 50-206, San Onofre 
Nuclear Generating Station, Unit No. 1, San Diego County, California 




Date of amendment request:

 April 18, 1994. 


Description of amendment request:

 The proposed amendment will revise 
Sections 2.C and 2.D of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 1 
(SONGS 1) Operating License. Section 2.C will be revised to modify or 
delete several licensing conditions which either no longer apply or require 
revision to apply to SONGS 1 in its permanently shutdown and defueled 
condition. Section 2.D will be revised to exempt Fire Protection reporting 
from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

 

1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences 
of an accident previously evaluated? 
No. SONGS 1 has been permanently shut down and all fuel has been 
taken out of the reactor and stored in the SONGS 1 spent fuel 
pool. The proposed change will not modify any of the existing 
plant configurations, controls, procedures, or technical 
specification requirements necessary to assure the integrity and 
safe operation of the spent fuel pool. 
The technical basis for deleting the four license conditions, 
which relate to Integrated Implementation Schedule, Cycle 11 
Thermal Shield Monitoring Program, Plant Modification to 
Eliminate Single Failure Susceptibility of Vital Bus Automatic 
Transfer Function, and the NRC's Confirmatory Order of January 2, 
1990, is that these license conditions were intended to assure 
the continued safe operation of SONGS 1 as a power producing 
plant. With the permanent shutdown of SONGS 1 and the issuance 
of its Permanently Defueled Technical Specifications (PDTS) on 
December 28, 1993, the plant modifications and safety programs 
associated with the four license conditions are no longer 
necessary. 
The technical basis for modifying the license condition on fuel 
transshipment is that this license condition was intended to 
ensure the safety of the operating plant by putting restrictions 
on operation of the turbine building gantry crane. These 
restrictions are no longer necessary, in light of the permanent 
shutdown of SONGS 1. 
The technical basis for modifying the license condition on 
physical protection is that this is necessary to update the 
information contained in the license condition. 
The technical basis for exempting the Fire Protection Program 
from the reporting requirements of Section 2.D is that the 
applicable requirements are adequately covered in 10 CFR 50.72 
and 50.73, as stated in Generic Letters 86-10 and 88-12. 
2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated? 
No. No safety-related equipment will be impacted by this 
proposed change. Thus, there is no credible likelihood that a 
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously 
evaluated would occur as a result of this proposed change. 
3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change 
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 
No. As explained earlier, the plant modifications and safety 
programs associated with the license conditions being deleted are 
no longer necessary. The safety-related equipment concerns that 
led to restrictions on operation of the turbine building gantry 
crane no longer exist. The modification to the license condition 
on physical protection will update the information contained in 
this license condition. 
The revision to Section 2.D will make the reporting requirements 
regarding deficiencies in the Fire Protection Program consistent 
with the NRC's generic guidance on this subject. 
Thus operation of the facility in accordance with this proposed 
change will not significantly reduce a margin of safety.

 

The NRC staff has reviewed the analysis of the licensee and, based on 
this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request 
involves no significant hazards consideration.

Units 1, 2 and 3, Limestone County, Alabama 





Date of amendment request:

 December 23, 1993 (TS346). 


Description of amendment request

: The proposed amendment would revise the BFN Units 1, 2, and 3 Technical Specifications (TS) by providing an alternate
visual inspection schedule for safety-related snubbers. The licensee has stated that the amendment follows the
recommendations of NRC Generic Letter (GL) 90-09, ``Alternative Requirements for Snubber Visual Inspection
Intervals and Corrective Actions'' dated December 11, 1990. GL 90-09 describes a TS line item improvement acceptable
to the NRC staff. The purpose of the line item improvement is to provide a means for reducing resource demands and unnecessary
occupational radiological exposure attributable to snubber inspections while continuing to provide an acceptable
level of confidence in snubber operability. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

 

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
Implementing the guidance specified in GL 90-09 will not introduce any new failure mode and will not alter any
assumptions previously made in evaluating the consequences of an accident. The proposed alternate schedule for
visual inspections will maintain the same operability confidence level as the existing schedule. Also, the surveillance
requirement and schedule for snubber functional testing remains the same providing a 95 percent confidence level
that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the specified acceptance limits. The proposed visual
inspection schedule is separate from functional testing and provides additional confidence that the installed
snubbers will serve their design function and are being maintained operable. The proposed changes do not affect limiting
safety system settings or operating parameters, and do not modify or add any accident initiating events or parameters.
Therefore, the proposed change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
Implementing the recommendations specified in GL 90-09 does not involve any physical alterations to plant
equipment, changes to setpoints or operating parameters, nor does it involve any potential accident initiating
event. As stated in the generic letter, the alternate schedule for snubber visual inspections maintains the same
confidence level as the existing schedule. Additionally, functional testing of snubbers provides a 95 percent confidence
level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within specified acceptance limits. Since this TS change
does not physically alter the plant equipment and the snubber confidence level remains the same there will not be any
new or different accident resulting from snubber failure from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed change incorporates the surveillance requirements for snubber visual inspection intervals following
the guidance provided in GL 90-09. As stated in the generic letter, the proposed snubber visual inspection interval
maintains the same confidence level as the existing snubber visual inspection interval. This surveillance requirement
does not alter the current Limiting Condition for Operation or the accompanying actions for the snubber(s). The requirement
for functional testing of safety-related snubbers is unchanged and remains the basis for the established margin
of safety and assures a 95 percent confidence level that 90 percent to 100 percent of the snubbers operate within the
specified acceptance limits. This functional testing along with the proposed visual inspection intervals provides
adequate assurance that the snubber will perform its intended function. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 





The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would: 





1a. Not involve a significance increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
initiators, conditions or assumptions are significantly affected by the proposed changes. 

The proposed changes would increase the required boration flowrate in the event the required SHUTDOWN MARGIN is not
met, increase the minimum required volume for the Boric Acid Addition System (BAAS) and increase the minimum required
boron concentration for the Borated Water Storage Tank (BWST) and the Core Flooding Tanks (CFT). The proposed changes
would also revise the Technical Specification (TS) Action Statements for the BWST and the CFT, revise the TS Surveillance
Requirement relating to boron concentration sampling of the CFT, and would revise the TS Surveillance Requirements
involving trisodium phosphate chemistry. In addition, various administrative and editorial changes, including
changes to the TS Bases, are proposed. As stated above, none of these proposed changes involve accident initiators,
conditions, or assumptions. 

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
conditions or assumptions are affected by the proposed changes. 

The proposed changes for the minimum required boron concentrations and volumes for the BAAS, BWST, and CPT comply
with existing requirements to maintain a 1% delta k/k shutdown margin (SDM) at all times, and are consistent with reload
and LOCA analysis. Therefore, the accident condition assumption of 1% delta k/k SDM at the initiation of an accident
will still be met and the radiological consequences will be as previously evaluated. 

The proposed changes do not alter the source term, containment isolation, or allowable releases. The proposed changes,
therefore, will not increase the radiological consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new accident
initiators or assumptions are introduced by the proposed changes. As stated in 1a, the proposed changes do not affect
any accident initiators and are not initiators themselves. The proposed changes do not alter any accident scenarios.


2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the
proposed changes only affect existing components, systems, and functions and do not introduce any new requirements
that cannot be met with the existing components, systems, and functions. The proposed changes do not alter any accident
scenarios. 

3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes to the minimum required boron concentration
and volumes for the BAAS, BWST, and CFT would ensure the margin of safety for reactor subcriticality is maintained
at all times for anticipated future core designs. 


The proposed change to the TS Action statement to increase the required boration flowrate in the event the SHUTDOWN
MARGIN requirement is not met, would ensure that the boration rate is adequate for restoring the required SHUTDOWN
MARGIN for anticipated future core design. 

The proposed changes to the TS Action statements for the BWST and the CFT ensure that the plant is maneuvered in a timely
and conservative manner, without challenging any plant systems, while minimizing the time the plant would be exposed
to a LOCA with assumptions not being met. 

The proposed changes to the TS Surveillance Requirements associated with trisodium phosphate chemistry would clarify
the requirements, make it easier to perform testing, minimize radwaste generation, and reduce the consequences
of a potential radioactive spill. The proposed changes would also make the requirements consistent with the DBNPS
Updated Safety Analysis Report. 

The proposed change to the TS Surveillance Requirement associated with the boron concentration sampling of the CFT
would eliminate an unnecessary requirement and make the Surveillance Requirement consistent with NUREG-1430.


None of these changes would adversely affect the margin of safety.

 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Toledo Edison Company, Centerior Service Company, and The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Docket No.
50-346, Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, Ottawa County, Ohio



Date of amendment request: 

April 5, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the TS 3/4.7.1.2, Auxiliary Feedwater System, TS 3/4.7.1.7, Motor Driven Feedwater
Pump System, and their applicable Bases. This amendment would: (a) Clarify the requirements for operation of the
Auxiliary Feedwater System and Motor Driven Feedwater Pump System, (b) increase the surveillance intervals for
testing the steam turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pumps and the electric motor driven pump, and (c) modify requirements
relative to stationing an individual locally, during associated surveillance testing.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would:




1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no change is
being made to any accident initiator. The proposed changes are clarifications and the incorporations of either the
recommendations of Generic Letter 93-05 or the guidance provided by NUREG-1430. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously
evaluated.

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the proposed
changes do not invalidate accident conditions or assumptions used in evaluating the radiological consequences
of an accident.

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the proposed
changes do not change the way the plant is operated. No new types of failures or accident initiators are introduced
by the proposed changes.

2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new
failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety, nor has any limiting single
failure been identified as a result of the proposed changes. No different accident initiators or failure mechanisms
are introduced by the proposed changes.

3. Not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed changes continue to ensure the availability
of the Auxiliary Feedwater System and the Motor Driven Feedwater System when called upon to perform their functions
and will not adversely impact any safety analysis assumptions.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Virginia Electric and Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-338 and 50-339, North 
Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2, Louisa County, Virginia





Date of amendment request: 

April 15, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&2). Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the pressure/temperature operating
limitations during heatup and cooldown and the Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) pressure
setpoints and temperatures for NA-1&2. Also, the proposed changes include revised Limiting Conditions
for Operation, Action Statements, and Surveillance Requirements for the Power-Operated Relief Valves (PORVs)
and block valves to address the concerns discussed in NRC Generic Letter 90-06. Additionally, the proposed
changes include several editorial/administrative changes.

The NA-1&2 Reactor Coolant Systems (RCS) are protected from material failure by the imposition of restrictions
on allowable pressure and temperature, and on heatup and cooldown rate. The LTOPS ensures that material integrity
limits are not exceeded during the design basis overpressurization accidents. Equipment operability requirements
are imposed to ensure that the assumptions of the accident analyses remain valid. The operating restrictions, setpoints,
and equipment operability requirements must be revised to extend their applicability to a higher cumulative burnup,
and to improve operational flexibility.

The current pressure/temperature operating limits and LTOPS setpoints are valid to 12 Effective Full-Power Years
(EFPY) and 17 EFPY for NA-1&2, respectively. According to the most recent estimates, the burnup applicability
limits will be exceeded by NA-1 in the spring of 1996. The NA-2 pressure/temperature operating limits
and LTOPS setpoints remain valid well into the year 2002. The proposed NA-1 TS include revised pressure/temperature
operating limits valid to end-of-license. Although the NA-2 pressure/temperature operating limits are not
being changed, the NA-2 LTOPS setpoints and associated reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy are
being changed. The reactor vessel integrity protection philosophy which supports the proposed TS changes provides
improved operational flexibility while maintaining an adequate margin of safety as demonstrated by the safety analysis.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

Specifically, operation of [North Anna] Power Station in accordance with the [proposed] Technical Specification
changes will not:




[1] involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The safety
analysis demonstrates that the proposed reactor vessel protection philosophy, and the associated pressure/temperature
limits, LTOPS setpoints, and component operability requirements, ensure that reactor vessel integrity will be
maintained during normaloperation and design basis accident conditions. Specifically, adherence to the heatup/cooldown
rate-dependent pressure/temperature operating limits ensures that the assumed design basis flaw will not propagate
during normal operation. Below the LTOPS enabling temperature, automatic actuation of the PORVs ensures that the
assumed design basis flaw will not propagate under design basis low-temperature overpressurization accident conditions.
Two pressurizer safety valve[s] are sufficient to relieve the overpressurization due to the inadvertent startup
of two charging pumps at water solid conditions without propagation of the assumed design basis flaw. The proposed
changes to address the concerns of Generic Letter 90-06 (Generic Issues 70 and 94) improve LTOPS availability
and reliability by instituting requirements for PORV, block valve, and control system testing and allowed outage
times for these components. Although these changes do not reduce the probability of occurrence or the consequences
of the LTOPS design basis (mass and heat addition) transients, the changes provide increased assurance that pressure
relieving devices will perform their design function when required.

[2] create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The proposed
Technical Specifications modify pressure/temperature operating limits, LTOPS setpoints and enabling temperatures,
and component operability requirements. The revised pressure/temperature operating limits, and LTOPS setpoints
and enabling temperatures are only slightly different than those currently in the Technical 
Specifications. No operating limits or setpoints are added or deleted by the proposed changes. Therefore, it may
be concluded that the operating limits and setpoint changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident. With regard to component operability requirements, restrictions on the number of charging pumps which
may be operable, the number of PORVs which must be operable, and the allowable temperature difference between the
steam generator primary and secondary remain unchanged. Only the setpoint temperature at which these restrictions
apply have been modified. The proposed changes are entirely consistent with the reactor vessel integrity protection
philosophy which ensures that the design basis reactor vessel flaw will not propagate under normal operation or postulated
accident conditions. Further, the proposed changes do not invalidate . . . any component design criteria
or the assumptions of any UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report] Chapter 15 accident analyses. In addition,
modifications have been made to the Technical Specifications to improve availability and reliability of PORVs and
associated block valves. These changes have been made in accordance with NRC guidance in Generic Letter 90-06.
It may be concluded that none of the proposed changes creates the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.

[3] involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As described above, the reactor vessel integrity protection
philosophy ensures that the design basis assumed flaw will not propagate under normal operation or design basis accident
conditions. Adherence to the Technical Specification pressure/temperature operating limits ensures that the
margin to vessel fracture provided by the ASME Section XI methodology is maintained. With regard to LTOPS protection,
the safety analysis demonstrates that the proposed LTOPS design ensures margins consistent with those provided
by ASME Section XI Appendix G methods. This conclusion is based on industry experience with LTOPS events and engineering
evaluation. Specifically, both industry experience and engineering evaluation demonstrate that LTOPS design
basis events may be expected to occur at essentially isothermal conditions. Engineering evaluation demonstrates
that any reduction in allowable pressure due to thermal stresses which may be expected to occur during low temperature
operation is insignificant when compared to margins provided by the ASME Section XI Appendix G methods for calculating
pressure/temperature operating limits. Use of the isothermal pressure/temperature limit curve as the design limit
for establishing low temperature PORV lift setpoints has been approved for other utilities by the NRC. This design
maximizes the operating margin above the minimum RCS pressure for reactor coolant pump (RCP) operation, thereby
minimizing the probability of undesired PORV lifts during RCP startup. The proposed changes to address the concerns
of Generic Letter 90-06 (Generic Issues 70 and 94) improve LTOPS availability and reliability by instituting
requirements for PORV, block valve, and control system testing and allowed outage times for these components. Although
these changes do not increase the margin of safety demonstrated by the analysis of the LTOPS design basis (mass and
heat addition) transients, the changes provide increased assurance that pressure relieving devices will perform
their design function when required.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1
and No. 2 (NA-1&2). Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the surveillance frequency of the
control rod motion testing from monthly to quarterly in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item
Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation''
dated September 27, 1993.

The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements for the control 
rods at NA-1&2 are consistent with the intent of GL 93-05, which is to 
improve safety, decrease equipment degradation, and reduce unnecessary 
burden on personnel resources by reducing testing requirements that are 
marginal to safety. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As 
required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the 
issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 

Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with 
the proposed Technical Specifications changes will not: 




1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence 
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change to the surveillance frequency for control 
rods does not increase the probability of an accident occurrence. 
Surveillance testing is a means of determining control rod 
operability and does not of itself contribute to control rod 
inoperability. Although reduced testing also implies a less 
frequent confirmation of mechanical operability, operational 
experience has established that the reduced testing does not 
decrease plant safety. Furthermore, reduced frequency testing 
reduces the probability of an inadvertent operational transient 
or misaligned control rod. There are other means available 
(e.g., Individual Rod Position Indicators, flux distributions 
anomalies) to detect a misaligned control rod. 
Reducing the frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the 
possibility of finding an inoperable control rod. Industry 
experience has shown that most inoperable (stuck) control rods 
are identified during rod drop testing and unit startup after 
refueling outages. Therefore, the NRC has determined that a 
reduced frequency surveillance test during power is acceptable to 
determine control rod operability (trippable). 

The control rods will continue to be operated in the same manner 
during the surveillance testing and will be available to shutdown 
the reactor if a Reactor Protection System trip setpoint is 
reached. The operability requirements, alignment and insertion 
limits for the control rods remain unchanged. Since the control 
rods remain available (trippable) to perform their intended 
safety function, testing of the control rods at the proposed 
reduced frequency will not increase the consequences of an 
accident previously evaluated. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident 
from any accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
not change the way the Control Rod Drive System or the control 
rods are operated. The reduced frequency of testing of the 
control rods does not alter the operation of the Control Rod 
Drive System or the control rods ability to perform their 
intended safety function. Therefore, the reduced frequency 
testing of the control rods does not generate any new accident 
precursors. In fact, industry experience has shown that this 
surveillance testing may result in inadvertent reactor trips, 
dropped control rods, or unnecessary challenges to safety 
systems. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind 
of accident than previously evaluated is not created by the 
proposed changes in surveillance frequency of the control rods. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed reduced frequency testing of the control rods does 
not change the control rod operability requirement or the way the 
Control Rod Drive System is operated. NUREG-1366, concluded that 
most stuck control rods are discovered during plant startup after 
refueling or during control rod drop testing. Therefore, routine 
surveillance testing of the control rods at the proposed reduced 
frequency is considered adequate to identify inoperable (stuck) 
control rods during operation. The reduced surveillance 
requirements do not affect the margin of safety in that the 
operability requirements remained unchanged and the existing 
safety analysis, which assumes the most reactive control rod 
sticks out of the core during accident scenarios, remains 
bounding. Therefore, no margins of safety are adversely 
affected. 




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request 
involves no significant hazards consideration.

<DOCTITLE>Houston Lighting & Power Co.; City Public Service Board of San Antonio Central Power and Light Co.; City of Austin,
TX South Texas Project, Unit Nos. 1 and 2 Environmental Assessment and Finding of no Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-76 and NPF-80, issued to Houston Lighting & Power Company (the licensee) for the
South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, located in Matagorda County, Texas.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


By letter dated May 27, 1993, the licensee proposed to upgrade the fuel used in the South Texas Project to Westinghouse's
VANTAGE 5 Hybrid (V5H) design and implement numerous safety analysis and operational margin improvements into the
South Texas Project Technical Specifications and Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed changes include
an increase in the maximum nominal enrichment for fuel assemblies from 4.5 weight percent (w/o) uranium-235 to 5.0
w/0.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The licensee upgraded to a higher enrichment fuel type to improve fuel economy and reduce the cobalt source term.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the technical specifications and concludes
that storage of new and spent fuel assemblies enriched with U-235 up to 5.0 w/0 at the South Texas Project, Units
1 and 2 is acceptable. The safety considerations associated has concluded that such changes would not adversely affect
plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverse affect on the probability of any accident. There will be no changes
to authorized power. As a result, there is no increase in individual or cumulative radiation exposure. The fuel burnup
will increase to 60,000 MWD/MTU. The radiological consequences of accidents have been reanalyzed to reflect this
increase and were determined not to be significantly changed.
The environmental impacts for transportation resulting from the use of higher enrichment and extended irradiation
are discussed in the staff assessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Transportation
Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation''. This assessment was published in the 

Federal Register 

on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) as corrected on August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32322) in connection with the Shearon Harris Nuclear
Power Plant, Unit 1: Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact. As indicated therein, the environmental
cost contribution of an increase in fuel enrichment of up to 5 weight percent U-235 are either unchanged, or may
in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S-4 as set forth in 10 CFR 51.52(c). These findings are applicable
to South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result
in no significant radiological environmental impact.


Alternative to the Proposed Action


Because the Commission's staff has concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action, any alternatives would have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater
environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would not reduce
the environmental impacts as a result of plant operations.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, and dated August 1986 (NUREG-1171).


Agencies and Persons Contacted


The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult with other agencies or persons.


Finding of no Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for license amendments dated May 27, 1993 which
is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, Lower Level, 2120
L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at Wharton County Junior College, J.M. Hodges Learning Center, 911 Boling
Highway, Wharton, Texas 77488.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; WPPSS Nuclear Project No. 2 Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuing an exemption from the requirements
of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 in response to a Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) request for the
WNP-2 nuclear plant, located in Benton County, Washington.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed action would grant an exemption from the requirement of Section III.D.3 of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J for
Type C testing of new containment purge supply and exhaust valves with metallic seats each refueling shutdown. It
would extend the maximum interval for Type C testing from 24 months to 27 months for these valves. The proposed action
is in accordance with the licensee's March 25, 1994, exemption request.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The licensee needs the proposed exemption because the present requirement forces the licensee to test the new metal-to-metal
seated containment purge supply and exhaust valves at least every 24 months. Testing these valves every 27 months
does not increase the risk to public health and safety and accommodates the unique WNP-2 refueling schedule.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption would not adversely affect primary containment integrity. Thus, it would not increase the
potential for radiological releases to the environment in the event of a severe plant transient or hypothetical accident,
including a fuel handling accident or design basis accident. Calculated offsite radiological doses at the plant
exclusion boundary and low population zone outer boundary will continue to meet 10 CFR part 100 criteria.
The licensee indicated that industry experience shows the new valves are capable of maintaining design leakage requirements
over an extended time. The licensee also indicated that they will require the replacement valves to meet even tighter
permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval between tests to 27 months allows for variations
in the approximately annual operating cycle length due to weather. Issuing this exemption will not increase accident
probability or result in any environmental impacts beyond those evaluated in the WNP-2 Final Environmental
Statement. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes
are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the
allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that
this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect nonradiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing in connection with this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14901). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.


Alternative to the Proposed Action


Any alternative with equal or greater environmental impact does not need to be evaluated since the Commission has
concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant.
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce the facility's environmental
impact, and would result in a larger expenditure of licensee resources to test containment purge and exhaust valves.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not use resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement related to operation
of the Washington Nuclear Project, Unit No. 2 dated December 1981.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted the Washington State official. The state official
had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
For further details with respect to this action, see the March 25, 1994, request for exemption which is available for
public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp.; Notice of Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix E, Section IV.F.2 to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, (the licensee), for operation
of the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1, located in Coffey County, Kansas. 


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


Section IV.F.2 of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 states ``Each license at each site shall annually exercise its emergency
plan.'' By letter dated March 8, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50,
Section IV.F.2, that would delay the exercise scheduled for 1994 until early 1995. The delay was requested in order
to allow for the approval and implementation of revised emergency classification criteria submitted to the NRC by
letter dated December 15, 1993, and to avoid conflict with the seventh refueling outage currently scheduled to begin
in September 1994. 
Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides an example of a special circumstance
for which the NRC will consider granting exemptions that involve cases providing only temporary relief from the applicable
regulation and for which the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. The licensee completed
an annual exercise in December 1993 and had scheduled the 1994 exercise for June 29, 1994. The proposed exemption would
delay the 1994 exercise until early 1995, approximately fourteen months after the 1993 exercise, and would not affect
the requirement to conduct the normally scheduled 1995 annual exercise.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption provides temporary relief to delay an annual emergency exercise in order to provide the licensee
an opportunity to implement revised emergency classification procedures and avoid conflict with a scheduled refueling
outage. The transition to the revised emergency action levels includes NRC review and additional training of licensee
personnel. Although these activities are expected to be completed during 1994, scheduling of the exercise for late
1994 would result in its coinciding with activities associated with the seventh outage. Both activities, the exercise
and refueling outage, are resource intensive and therefore, it is undesirable to schedule them for the same time period.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that granting of the temporary
relief does not affect the configuration of plant systems or any manner of their operation. The proposed exemption
is limited to a delay in the conduct of an annual emergency exercise such that the interval between the 1993 exercise
and the delayed exercise is extended to approximately fourteen months. The delay in the exercise does not constitute
a significant degradation in emergency planning and would therefore not result in an increase in radiological consequences
in the event of a major accident involving the release of radioactive materials. Accordingly, the Commission concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological evironmental impact. 
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves the action of emergency
plan exercises. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and there are no other nonradiological environmental
impact associated with the proposed exemption. 


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
would be to deny the requested exemption and require the licensee to conduct an emergency exercise during the 1994
calendar year. Conducting an exercise prior to implementation of the revised emergency action levels would reduce
potential benefits since key event classification procedures would be superseded shortly following the exercise.
Conducting the exercise late in 1994 would result in conflicts with the planning and execution of the seventh refueling
outage. 


Alternate Use of Resource


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
in the Wolf Creek Generating Station dated June 1982. 


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Kansas State official. The State official had
no comments regarding the NRC's proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The NRC staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated March 8, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Rooms, Emporia State University, William Allen White Library, 1200 Commercial

<DOCTITLE>Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp.; Notice of Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1(a) to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, (the licensee), for
operation of the Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1, located in Coffey County, Kansas.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action


Section III.D.1(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires the performance of three Type A tests, overall integrated
leakage rate tests (ILRTs), at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period with the third test
of each set being conducted when the plant is shutdown for the 10-year plant inservice inspections. Wolf Creek Nuclear
Operating Corporation performed the first two ILRTs for the first 10-year service period in October 1988 and September
1991. The licensee proposes to perform the third test during the eighth refueling outage which coincides with the
10-year plant inservice inspections. However, the current schedule for the eighth refueling outage would result
in the test being performed approximately six months beyond the 10-year service period.
Section 50.12(a)(2)(ii) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides an example of a special circumstance
for which the NRC will consider granting exemptions that involve cases for which application of the regulation is
not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. The licensee completed ILRTs in October 1988 and September
1991. Strict application of Appendix J would require performance of another ILRT during the seventh refueling outage
in order to achieve three tests within the 10-year service period and a subsequent test during the eighth refueling
outage in order to perform an ILRT during the 10-year plant inservice inspections. In order to avoid performance of
the fourth ILRT, the licensee has proposed a one-time exemption to allow performance of the third ILRT during the eighth
refueling outage. Performance of the third test during the eighth refueling outage would result in the test being
performed approximately 54 months after the second test.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The proposed exemption would extend the performance of the third ILRT several months beyond the end of the first 10-year
service period in order to preclude the need to perform ILRTs during consecutive refueling outages. The need for the
exemption results from the requirement to perform the ILRT during refueling outages and the schedules associated
with the seventh and eighth refueling outages. ILRTs need to be performed during both the seventh and eighth refueling
outages to satisfy both aspects of the Appendix J periodic retest schedules; three tests during 10-year service intervals
with the third test during 10-year plant inservice inspections.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that granting of the one-time
relief does not affect the configuration of plant systems or plant operating practices. The proposed exemption is
limited to the scheduling for the third ILRT during the first 10-year service interval. Previous testing has demonstrated
the integrity of the containment structure. Leakage through containment penetrations and valves would continue
to be identified by performance of local leak rate testing (LLRT). Therefore, no increase in the release of radioactive
materials following an accident would result from the extension of the ILRT testing interval. The extension of the
ILRT interval does not affect the radioactive effluent releases during normal operation. Accordingly, the Commission
concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves the scheduling of ILRT testing.
It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and there are no other nonradiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
would be to deny the requested exemption and require the licensee to conduct ILRT during both the seventh and eighth
refueling outages. Denial would not significantly reduce the environmental impact of plant operation and would
result in lost electrical generation and expense of significant licensee resources.


Alternate Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Wolf Creek Generating Station dated June 1982.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Kansas State official. The State official had
no comments regarding the NRC's proposed action.


Finding of No Significant Impact


The NRC staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 27, 1993, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Rooms, Emporia State University, William Allen White Library, 1200 Commercial
Street, Emporia, Kansas 66801 and the Washburn University School of Law Library, Topeka, Kansas 66621.

<DOCTITLE>Carolina Power & Light Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-63 issued to Carolina Power & Light Company (the licensee) for operation of the Shearon
Harris Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, located in Wake and Chatham Counties, North Carolina.

The proposed amendment would allow reduced power operation as a function of reactor coolant system (RCS) total flow
rate for flow rate reductions of up to 5 percent below the currently specified flow rate. Operation would be allowed
at total flow rates slightly lower than (293,540 gpm  x  (1.0 plus C1)) if rated thermal power (RTP) is reduced
by 1.5 percent for each one percent that RCS total flow is less than this rate. This change would provide for needed operational
margin and flexibility without the unnecessary penalty of a large power reduction.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Since the proposed amendment does not involve any changes in the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) configuration, the
precursors to those Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accidents previously evaluated are unchanged. RCS total
flow and RTP are traded off against one another to maintain the current departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR)
margins. NRC-approved methodologies and the NRC-approved 17  x  17 Mechanical Design Report have been used
to verify that current design criteria continue to be satisfied. Therefore, there would be no increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not involve any modifications or additions to plant equipment and the design and operation
of the unit will not be affected.The allowable reduction in the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint will not
introduce any new FSAR Chapter 15 accident precursors. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety as defined in the Bases to the Technical Specifications.
The RATED THERMAL POWER is reduced consistent with the RCS total flow to maintain the margin of safety. This margin
has been assessed by the evaluations performed with the approved methodologies as defined in the Technical Specifications.
The reduction of the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint ensures that the DNBR margin for the analyses of record
is maintained for those FSAR Chapter 15 events that utilize the Power Range Neutron Flux-High Trip Setpoint trip function.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By June 24, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27605. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene
shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected
by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be
permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the
Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other
interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's
interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which
petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted
as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-800-248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William H. Bateman, petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition
was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to R.E. Jones, General Counsel, Carolina Power & Light Company, Post Office Box 1551,
Raleigh, North Carolina 27602, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or requests should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated May 11, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Cameron Village Regional Library, 1930 Clark Avenue, Raleigh,
North Carolina 27605.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Temporary Approval for One Year to
Proposed Rule Change Permitting Competing Specialists on the Floor of the Exchange



May 18, 1994.




On June 4, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to permit competing specialists (``CSs'') on the floor of the Exchange and to adopt guidelines
governing their registration and activity. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 32549 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36229 (July 6, 1993).







In addition, on July 7, 1993, September 24, 1993, and October 12, 1993, the Exchange filed with the Commission Amendment
Nos. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The amendments were published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33089
(October 22, 1993), 58 FR 58205 (October 29, 1993). Amendment Nos. 1 and 3 were largely technical, and resulted in deletions
from the final text of the rule.
 Amendment No. 2 adds to the procedures for CSs an index arbitrage provision
 and a restriction on cash payment for order flow by CSs in those stocks in which the specialist becomes registered as
a CS.









II. Description of the Proposal


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit competing specialists on the floor of the BSE. Currently, each
stock traded on the BSE is assigned to one particular specialist. This contrasts with a multiple market maker system
where competing market makers compete for order flow in the same securities. The BSE competing specialist proposal
will permit up to three specialists
 in each stock, who would compete with each other for order flow.
 Each specialist will have the same affirmative and negative obligations as are imposed currently upon BSE specialists.

<PARENT> FR940525-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Moreover, the BSE rules governing the auction market principles of priority, parity, and precedence remain unchanged.
 Thus, if the specialists are quoting the same price (i.e., they are on price parity), the earliest bid/offer at that
price has time priority and will be filled first up to its specified size; and if the specialists are on both price and
time parity, then all bids/offers equal to or greater than the size of the contra-side order are on parity and entitled
to precedence over smaller ones (if it is possible to determine the order of time such orders were made, they shall be
filled in that order).




In addition to facilitating competition among the specialists, the proposal permits preferenced order routing.
Orders may be directed to any specialist based on the request of the firm submitting the order, or, if a particular specialist
is not specified, then the orders will be directed to the regular specialist.
 If an order is entered into BSE's automated order routing system (``BEACON'') by a member firm affiliated with a specialist,
that order automatically will be routed to that member firm's affiliated specialist, thereby preventing member
firms affiliated with a specialist from routing non-profitable orders through BEACON to the other specialist when
market conditions are unfavorable.






All limit orders in a pilot stock, regardless as to which specialist they are sent, will be represented and executed
strictly according to time priority in BEACON. Once all limit orders at the Intermarket Trading System best bid or
offer (``ITS/BBO'') or better are depleted, each specialist will be responsible for the market orders directed specifically
to it. BEACON (which handles approximately 95% of all order flow on the BSE) will execute automatically
 an incoming order against an order on the book, and only if there is no contra-side agency order on the limit order book
at the price will the incoming order be routed to the designated specialist for execution.




In addition to the rules discussed above, the proposal outlines registration procedures and daily responsibilities
for CSs. All competing specialists will be responsible for:



a. Cooperating with the regular specialist regarding openings and reopenings to ensure that they are unitary;
b. Keeping each other informed and communicating to inquiring floor brokers the full size of any executable ``all
or none'' orders in their possession and representing such orders on a best efforts basis to ensure the execution of
the entire order at a single price or prices, or not at all;
c. Communicating their markets to the regular specialist and being responsible for their portion of the published
bid and/or offer; and
d. Conforming generally to all of the rules and policies applicable to a regular specialist.



To register as a CS the applicant must submit a written application to the Market Performance Committee (``MPC''),
listing in order of preference the stock(s) in which the applicant requests to compete. The MPC will then review the
application
 considering the following factors:



 Overall performance evaluation results of the applicant;
 Financial capability;
 Adequacy of manpower on the floor;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00150 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Existence of an adequate information barrier policy in the applicant firm;
 and








 Objection by the regular specialist in a stock, with or without cause.






In addition, all applicants must be registered with the Exchange as specialists and must meet the current minimum
requirements set forth in chapter XV of the BSE rules, the minimum capital and equity requirements as set forth in Chapters
VIII and XII of the BSE rules, and conform to all other performance requirements and standards set forth in the Rules
of the Exchange.




Any specialist seeking to terminate its status must so notify the MPC at least three business days prior to the desired
effective date of such withdrawal from competition. Withdrawal from registration by a CS will bar that CS from applying
to compete in that same stock for 90 days following the effective date of withdrawal. When the regular specialist requests
to be relieved of a stock, the stock will be posted for reallocation by the Stock Allocation Committee. In the interim,
if the MPC is satisfied that the CS can continue to maintain a fair and orderly market in such stock, the CS will serve
as the regular specialist until the stock has been reallocated.
 Where there is more than one CS in the stock, Exchange staff will place the stock with a caretaker
 until reallocation.






The registration of any CS may be suspended or terminated by the MPC upon a determination of any substantial or continued
failure by such CS to engage in dealings in accordance with the Constitution and Rules of the Exchange.




Finally, the proposal amends the BSE Rule governing the specialist's book, the contents of which are otherwise confidential,
to add a provision permitting specialists to disclose information in their books to other specialists competing
in the same stocks on a summary basis as provided for in the procedures for CSs.




III. Summary of Comments





The Commission has received comment letters on the proposal from the American Stock Exchange (``Amex),
 Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX''),
 Cincinnati Stock Exchange (``CSE''),
 and New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''),
 as well as BSE's responses thereto.
 The letters (with the exception of the CSE) raise similar concerns with the BSE proposal about the preferencing feature,
internalization of order flow, payment for order flow, adequate information barrier procedures, and the overall
effect on auction market principles.
 These comments are discussed in more detail below.

A. Preferencing


All four commentators attempted to draw an analogy between the Cincinnati Dealer Preferencing Program (``CSE pilot'')
 and the BSE proposal by alleging that the latter is in fact a preferencing system despite the lack of a reference to the
term ``preferencing'' in the proposal.
 The NYSE also alleges that although the BSE rules currently provide for the same auction market procedures as NYSE
Rule 72, the competing specialist proposal effectively would change those procedures by always giving priority
to the designated specialist when no other contra-side agency orders are present.
 The BSE, in response, asserts that their priority, parity, and precedence rules work the same way as the NYSE rules
did, when competing specialists were permitted on their floor, in that a BSE specialist quoting the ITS/BBO would
have priority over the other specialist who is quoting an inferior market.








B. Internalization


Internalization of order flow is the ability of diversified firms to retain incoming customer orders by routing them
to their affiliated specialist for execution, thereby participating on both sides of the transaction. The NYSE asserts
that the BSE proposal could lessen auction market depth and efficiency because the preferenced order flow is internalized
by specialists, does not participate in the auction market, and is executed outside of it.
 The NYSE and Amex further maintain that by allowing internalization of order flow, the BSE proposal will diminish
the efficiencies of auction market pricing by denying preferenced orders any exposure to the primary market and opportunity
for price betterment thereon, and ultimately will lead to market fragmentation.






The NYSE believes the Commission should weigh possible positive effects of competing specialists, such as fostering
competition, against the potential negative effects, such as distortion of the auction market, and encourages the
Commission to undertake a more comprehensive study of preferencing in order to determine whether or not it works to
the benefit of the investing public.
 In response, the BSE suggests that competition will heighten as the competing specialists strive to establish priority
on the BSE floor.
 Moreover, according to the BSE, liquidity in the national market will increase at the ITS/BBO because (1) the competing
specialists will be forced to quote at the ITS/BBO to retain priority, and (2) the BSE quote disseminated when two or
more specialists are simultaneously bidding at the same price will reflect their aggregated size.







The NYSE and Amex also note that the BSE system in theory requires marketable customer limit orders to be cleared before
a preferenced specialist can trade with its own order flow.
 The NYSE and Amex maintain, however, that there is nothing to prevent BSE member firms from withholding their limit
orders from the market, and sending them down to the exchange floor only when they have become marketable, at which
time they are paired off against the affiliated specialist for execution.
 The NYSE and Amex further assert that BSE firms with affiliated specialists would be motivated to act in such a fashion
because they would be providing each organization an ongoing opportunity to trade as principal with its customers'
market orders.
 The BSE, however, maintains that BEACON will not accommodate such a practice because the system does not accept paired
orders (where one side is an agency order and one side is a BSE market maker as principal).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00152 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The BSE states, and the NYSE notes, that all BSE market and marketable limit orders routed to a designated specialist
will still continue to be exposed for 15 seconds to allow the specialist to execute the order at a price better than the
ITS/BBO before automatic execution at the ITS/BBO.






Finally, the Amex further asserts that increased internalization resulting from the BSE proposal will lead to more
order flow to the BSE, which will in turn increase the amount of risk incurred by BSE specialists. As a result, the Amex
alleges, BSE specialists will ``lay off'' their risk on the primary market specialist by means of offsetting executions
following a BSE transaction,
 thus increasing the risk factor to the Amex specialists. The Amex concludes that this potential increased risk, and
the desire to foster protection of customer orders, is the basis for its pending competing dealer proposal.





C. Effect on Auction Market Principles



The NYSE and Amex assert that the proposal represents a departure from agency/auction principles and a movement toward
``dealerization'' of regional exchange markets by encouraging firms to set up CSs in order to internalize preferenced
order flow which is thereby denied the chief benefits of auction market trading.
 The Amex further asserts that:




This development can only increase concerns * * * regarding regional exchange market making in primary
exchange listed securities_namely, increased market fragmentation, passive quotations and autoquoting, failure
to enhance price discovery and provide price betterment, and failure to reflect full bid/offer size.





The Amex also does not believe the BSE proposal will benefit the investing public, asserting that for most securities
there is little evidence to support the proposition that increasing the number of market making participants increases
competition and provides price betterment.






The CHX letter, although more of a commentary on the CSE pilot than on the BSE proposal, reaches the conclusion that
it would be inconsistent for the Commission to permit the CSE pilot to operate without permitting the more traditional
exchanges to compete by providing similar systems of their own.
 In addition, the CHX takes the position that the BSE proposal is a type of preferencing system, but contains fewer negative
aspects than does CSE's pilot. Therefore, the CHX believes it would be illogical to permit the CSE pilot to continue
while disapproving the BSE proposal.







D. Payment for Order Flow



Both the CSE pilot and the BSE proposal include a prohibition against cash payments, by preferencing market makers
and CSs respectively, for preferenced order flow.
 The NYSE suggest that the BSE's restriction may be broader than the CSE's because it appears to apply to regular specialists
as well as CSs.
 The BSE response, however, emphasized that its restriction only applies to a CS in those stocks in which he becomes
registered as a CS. The NYSE, Amex, and BSE, however, concur that the Commission should address the payment for order
flow issue on a national level. The NYSE suggests that the Commission prohibit all dealers and specialists in all markets
from paying for order flow.
 The BSE response advocated a clear standard for all industry participants, suggesting that the Commission either
prohibit all dealers and specialists in all markets from paying for order flow or allow all such market participants
to decide the issue for themselves.
 The Amex agreed with the BSE in so far as the issue should be addressed in a conceptually consistent manner rather than
a piecemeal approach.










E. Information Barriers



The NYSE and Amex commented on the BSE's original requirement that competing specialists affiliated with upstairs
firms must have and maintain appropriate information barrier procedures as approved by any SRO, noting that the BSE
had no actual rules in place on the establishment or enforcement of such procedures.
 In response, the BSE separately filed information barrier procedures with the Commission.







IV. Discussion



For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the BSE competing specialist proposal on a one-year
pilot basis. During the pilot the BSE will be required to monitor the pilot, collect data, and submit reports as outlined
below.

As a preliminary matter, the Commission supports efforts by exchanges to provide increased market making and competition
on their trading floors or trading systems. Such efforts should increase the provision of liquidity services by an
exchange and enable it to compete more effectively with other markets. The addition of specialist competition on
the BSE floor could help in this regard. At the same time, the Commission is sensitive to the concerns of many of the commentators
about the structural implications of the preferencing feature of the BSE proposal. The Commission believes that
it is important that the competing specialist program provide real quote competition for the benefit of investors,
and not simply a means for firms to internalize their customer order flow while receiving specialist designation
and treatment. Accordingly, as discussed in more detail below, the Commission only is approving the BSE proposal
on a one-year pilot basis. During that time, the BSE is expected to monitor its pilot and provide the Commission with
a report on its operation detailing how the proposal has affected the quality of BSE's market, including its effect
on quote competition. The Commission expects the BSE to adequately demonstrate, through the periodic reporting
requirements outlined below and other such data as the Exchange may wish to generate, that there are in fact beneficial
competitive effects from the CS program. Specifically, the Commission expects the Exchange to analyze the effects
of the program on the quality of the market making by BSE specialists as a result of competition. For the reasons outlined
below, if the BSE cannot provide such an analysis, the Commission would have serious reservations about continuing
the preferencing feature of the program.

<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00153 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

As discussed above, many of the commentators discussed their views on CSE's preferencing pilot in commenting on the
BSE proposal and made certain conclusions about the effects of the BSE's proposal based on the experience with the
CSE preferencing pilot. Although the Commission believes the discussion is useful, we note that the CSE differs in
market structure and in the details of the preferencing system. Under the CSE's pilot, preferenced dealers have priority
over same-priced market maker or professional agency interest entered prior in time when the preferenced dealer
is interacting with the public agency market and marketable limit orders that he or she represents as agent.

50

 Further, the CSE system does not currently provide for exposure for orders that would allow for potential price improvement
on incoming orders. Instead, price improvement on the CSE is only possible if the CSE dealer either (1) unilaterally
improves the price before sending the cross to the CSE for execution, or (2) voluntarily exposes the improved order
to the national consolidated quote system for possible improvement before filling it at the ITS/BBO.





The BSE has attempted to design its proposal to enable customers to receive best execution of their orders while stimulating
competition among specialists. As previously stated, the proposal does not alter the auction market principles
of priority, parity, and precedence. In addition, limit orders will continue to be executed in accordance with traditional
auction market principles. Under the BSE proposal, all limit orders will be represented and executed strictly according
to time priority according to the order of their receipt in Beacon, irrespective of which specialist they are sent
to. Further, all market and marketable limit orders will continue to receive a 15 second exposure for possible price
improvement.

51

 Before an incoming preferenced order is executed against the specialist, Beacon scans its limit order book. If there
is a contra-side order on the book, Beacon will match up the two orders and execute without the specialist's participation
(unless the specialist opts to improve the price).





The BSE proposal also is designed to provide for potential quote competition. The only time the BSE's proposed preferencing
feature can force a non-designated specialist with clearly established priority on the BSE floor to yield priority
to a preferenced competitor, so that it may trade as principal with the incoming preferenced order, is when (1) the
ITS/BBO is greater than the BSE BBO, and (2) there is no contra-side agency order priced equal to or better than the ITS/BBO
(i.e., all limit orders at the price have been depleted). The BSE asserts that this will enhance quote competition
and, at a minimum, add liquidity at the ITS/BBO.

The Commission recognizes that BSE specialists currently quote at the best ITS price only 5% of the time.

52

 The proposal, however, allegedly provides an incentive for specialists desiring to attract order flow to quote more
often at the ITS/BBO. If the BSE's assertion is correct in that the specialists will be motivated to compete for priority
on the floor, then liquidity could be enhanced at the ITS/BBO. In addition, if the specialists are simultaneously
bidding at the same price, the sizes will be aggregated for purposes of disseminating the BSE quote.

53

 In sum, the proposal potentially could add depth at the ITS/BBO if the BSE specialists begin to quote at the best ITS
price more frequently than is the practice today, and thereby improve the overall quality of the BSE market place.
Although it is unclear whether the BSE proposal will have this result, the Commission intends to carefully evaluate
the effects on the quality of the BSE market from this potential ``quote competition'' and whether the majority of
preferenced orders are executed by the affiliated specialist when quoting at less than the ITS/BBO. As indicated
above, the Commission expects the BSE to provide sufficient evidence confirming the existence of enhanced quote
competition.

With respect to the BSE proposal's effect on internalization of order flow, and the potential for market fragmentation
as a result, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') recently examined the extent of market
fragmentation in its Market 2000 Study. The Division found that multiple, varied market centers and competitors
for listed stocks has provided many benefits to the users of the markets without impairing market quality or price
discovery. The Division concluded that concerns about fragmentation have been overstated. However, the Commission
is concerned that the implementation of a preferencing system at one or more exchanges may alter the analysis.

The potential effects of internalization by BSE specialists, however, are difficult to analyze without some experience
about the effects of the pilot. The Commission does note that if the program of competing specialists is used merely
to expand the number of specialists internalizing order flow rather than as a means of improving the quality of BSE
markets, then the proposal would raise additional questions as to whether the competing specialists are acting as
active market makers and deserve specialist designation and the benefits accruing thereto. Accordingly, although
the BSE proposal may result in more internalization of order flow, the Commission is not willing at this time to conclude
that it will be detrimental to the quality of the equity markets, but instead intends to revisit this issue at the expiration
of the pilot. In reaching this conclusion, the Commission emphasizes that the BSE proposal is limited in scope, and
best execution of customer orders in the context of fair competition is still a primary objective. Under the proposal,
customer orders will continue to be able to interact, and the opportunity for price improvement exists.

The preferencing feature of the competing specialist program also raises questions about the use of payment for order
flow by BSE specialists. As discussed previously, during the pilot program a CS will be prohibited from making cash
payments for order flow in those stocks in which it is registered as a CS. Such a prohibition is important to assess the
effects of the proposal and incentives for market participants to take part in it and to benefit therefrom. The Commission
is still considering the concerns regarding the issue of payment for order flow on the national level. On October 7,
1993, the Commission published for comment Rule 11Ac1-3 and amendments to Rule 10b-10 under the Act relating
to enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow practices. The Commission also sought comments on various alternative
approaches to payment for order flow, such as banning the practice outright, pass-through the payment to customers,
and decimalization.
 Accordingly, any final outcome in that rule making procedure may ultimately effect the payment for order flow issue
in the BSE's pilot.

Finally, as discussed above, the Commission also is approving today information barrier procedures for BSE specialists.
These procedures ensure that upstairs firms affiliated with BSE specialists will not receive information advantages
due to the relationship between the entities.





Based on the above, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow the BSE to implement its competing specialist
proposal on a one-year pilot basis. In making this determination, the Commission has carefully analyzed the potential
benefits from competition, such as better quotes, with the potential for increased internalization of order flow.
The Commission believes that the BSE has incorporated features in its proposal to allow it to implement, for a one-year
period, a competing specialist system that will allow firms to designate order flow to an affiliated specialist.
The Commission, nevertheless, believes that before the BSE proposal will be extended beyond the one-year pilot period
or approved on a permanent basis, the BSE will have the burden to prove that its proposal resulted in added depth and
liquidity to its market and improved quotations. The Commission emphasizes that if the Commission is dissatisfied
with the data or the market effects of the pilot, it would not be inclined to extend the competing specialist program.
Accordingly, the Commission requests that the BSE provide, on a quarterly basis, the following information:



1. A list indicating how many competing specialists are on the Exchange.
2. A list identifying, for each competing specialist, the issues in which they are competing.
3. The volume of ``preferenced'' trades in each issue; and the percentage of total volume of trades sent to the BSE for
execution in each issue represented by ``preferenced'' volume.
4. The volume of ``preferenced'' share and transaction volume; and the percentage of total BSE share and transaction
volume the ``preferenced'' volume represents.
5. BSE's volume attributable to ITS commitments sent by other ITS participant markets; and the percentage of such
commitments attributable to ``preferenced'' issues.
6. The number of ``preferenced'' orders executed by the non-designated specialist(s).
7. The number of ``preferenced'' orders effected against the limit order book, both in total and separately for each
``preferenced'' issue.
8. The number of limit orders placed on the book, as compared to before the commencement of this pilot, both for the BSE
as a whole and separately for the stocks for which there are competing specialists.
9. BSE's share of Tape trade reports, as compared to before the commencement of this pilot.



Further, we request the Exchange to submit a report to the Commission, discussing the data outlined above, eight months
from the date of commencement of the competing specialist pilot. The report should discuss such data in terms of the
effects of the competing specialist pilot on the quality of the BSE market with respect to depth, liquidity, and quote
improvement.





V. Conclusion


The Commission finds preliminarily that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the
requirements of section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission preliminarily believes the proposal is consistent with section 6(b)(5) because it
is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of free and open market and a national market system.




It is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-93-12) is approved for a period of one year through May 18,
1995.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Modifying
Exercise Settlement Date and Buy-In Procedures</DOCTITLE>







Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on December 27, 1993, Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared substantially by DGOC. On February 16, 1994, and on March 4, 1994, DGOC submitted substantive
amendments to the filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposal will amend Delta's exercise settlement procedures.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Under current practice, the exercise settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business
days following the expiration date or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. Under the proposed amendments
to section 1004 of DGOC's procedures, the exercise settlement date for an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury
note will be (1) the next business day following the date on which an exercise notice is purposely assigned for those
contracts exercised on a day preceding the expiration date and (2) the next business day following the expiration
date for those contracts exercised on the expiration date. For an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise
settlement date will be the next business day after an exercise notice is properly tendered. The purpose of the proposal
is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more closely follow the practices
already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement of purchases and sales of
Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities.

By shortening DGOC's settlement period to conform to the industry standard, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such
settlement obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as in the overall
cash market clearing system for the settlement of Government securities. Using the same settlement period for the
settlement of exercised options and for the settlement of securities in the cash market will ensure a consistent approach
among clearing entities and will serve as a platform for additional coordination among clearing entities clearing
identical or complimentary securities. In addition to reducing credit risk in the clearance system, a shortening
of the settlement cycle will further reduce risk by enabling DGOC to uncover potential problems earlier and will allow
DGOC to make expedited determinations of whether failures by participants to deliver securities are due to processing
problems, market effect, or credit related difficulties.

Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar
OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing
costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation
of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those
of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate
the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants
greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC and will allow for the automated clearance and settlement
of securities transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes.

In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC is proposing to amend section 1005 of its
Procedures to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8 a.m. on the business day
prior to the exercise settlement date. Currently, DGOC allocates exercise settlement obligations on the second
business day prior to the exercise settlement date.

DGOC also is proposing to amend section 1102 of its procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant
fails to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing
to deliver and with good cause shown, DGOC will be authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in. Currently, DGOC can
defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours. Second, the time for the delivery of a notice of buy-in
from DGOC to the participant which failed to deliver will be specifically set forth is thirty calendar days after the
failure to deliver.

Delta believes the proposed rule change is consistent with requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the
Act,
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to DGOC. This is because the proposed rule change will permit
more utilization of the DGOC system by those participants who prefer to trade in options for hedging purposes or for
speculation.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



DGOC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



DGOC has neither solicited nor received any comments.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:




(A) By order approve the proposed rule change or 

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing also will be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of DGOC. All submissions should refer to the file number SR-DGOC-93-04
and should be submitted by June 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Definition of ``Trading Limit'' </DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act 1 of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on April 22, April 28, and May 9, 1994, the Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-94-02)
as described in Items, I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by DGOC. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 




I. Self-Regulatory Organizations Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 




DGOC is proposing to amend the definition of ``trading limit'' found in Section 101 (Definitions) of Article I (Definitions)
of its Procedures and to make a conforming change to Section 204 (Trading Limits) of Article II (Participation) of
its Procedures. 




II. Self-regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, DGOC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, the proposed Rule Changes




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to clarify that each participant's trading limit means the limit prescribed
from time to time for that participant on the aggregate incremental margin that the participant may owe on a particular
day with respect to its short positions and the settlement of exercised options.
 The proposal also makes conforming changes to clarify that each participant's trading limit is revised from time
to time.








DGOC states that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act
 and the rules thereunder. In particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
 requires that a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt
and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. DGOC states that the proposed rule change will
enable DGOC to control risk better, to provide greater flexibility to its participants, and to permit more utilization
of DGOC and thereby the national clearance and settlement system for trading in options. 






(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements on Burden on Competition 



DGOC believes that no burden will be placed on competition as a result of the proposed rule change.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others




DGOC neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) (i) of the Act
 and subparagraph (e)(1) Rule 19b-4 thereunder
 because it constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration,
or enforcement of an existing rule. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 






IV. Solicitation of Comments





Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of DGOC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-DGOC-94-02
and should be submitted by June 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Modifying
the Definition of Expiration Date</DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.



On January 18, 1994, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change that modifies the definition of expiration date. On March 31, 1994, the Commission published
notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.





I. Description


The proposed rule change amends DGOC's definition of ``expiration date,'' found in Article I of DGOC's Procedures,
to provide that the expiration date may occur on any business day on or before the second anniversary of the writing
of the option contract.
 The proposal is a response to DGOC participants' requests that DGOC afford them the opportunity to select expiration
dates that match more precisely the tenor of other financial contracts developed in the over-the-counter market
and in other trading environments. The proposal enables participants to submit for processing at DGOC treasury options
trades that prior to this proposal could not have been submitted to DGOC because their stated expiration dates were
not available through DGOC.




II. Discussion


Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act that the rules of a clearing agency must promote the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and must remove impediments to and must perfect the mechanism of a national
system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 The proposal enlarges the class of treasury option trades eligible for clearance and settlement at DGOC. By potentially
increasing the number of trades that will be cleared and settled through DGOC, which is a registered clearing agency
with automated clearance and settlement procedures, the proposal facilitates the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transaction. Furthermore, more trades can be processed through the national clearance
and settlement system that otherwise would have to be settled through decentralized and more inefficient operations.




In addition, the proposal affords DGOC participants with additional flexibility to adjust duration in relation
to their overall treasury security portfolios. This will enable participants to manage their risks more effectively.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of
the Act.


It is therefore ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-94-01)
be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Time for Exercises of Options and for the Assignments of Exercise Notices</DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.



On December 27, 1993, pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change that modifies certain procedures for exercises of options. On February 14, 1994, DGOC filed
with the Commission an amendment to the proposed rule change. On April 5, 1994, the Commission published notice of
the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 to solicit comment from interested persons.
 No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.






I. Description



The proposed rule change modifies the time for tender of exercise notices by DGOC participants maintaining long positions;
the procedure DGOC uses to assign exercise notices to participants maintaining short positions; and the time by which
exercise notices will be assigned. Section 1001 (Exercise Procedures) of DGOC's Procedures establishes the time
by which a participant must tender to DGOC's clearing bank an option exercise notice. The cutoff time is revised from
5:00 p.m. to 4 p.m. or such earlier time as may be announced by the Public Securities Association as the recommended
closing time for trading in the government securities markets on the business day the participant wishes to exercise
an option contract.






DGOC's Procedures section 1002 (Assignment of Exercise Notices) described the manner in which exercise notices
are assigned to participants. Prior to this amendment, when less than all exercisable options in a class of options
(

i.e.,

 all puts and calls covering the same issue of Treasury securities) were exercised, exercise notices were assigned
randomly to participants that maintained short positions in that class of options. As amended, exercise notices
are assigned to each participant maintaining a short position in the same class of options on a pro rata basis. DGOC
determines the number of exercise notices allocated to a participant by dividing the number of options subject to
exercise maintained by such participant by the number of all options in the same class. This number is multiplied by
the total number of exercise notices received by DGOC for the class of options.

Finally, the proposal change the time by which exercise notices will be assigned under DGOC's Procedures section
1002. Previously, exercise notices were assigned at or before 8 a.m. on the business day following the business day
that DGOC's clearing bank accepted them. With this amendment, exercise notices are to be assigned at or before 5:00
p.m. on the same business day that DGOC's clearing bank accepts them.



II. Discussion



Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act provides that the rules of a clearing agency must protect investors and the public
interest and must remove impediments to and must perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 By requiring that all option exercise notices be tendered prior to 4 p.m., DGOC will have the ability to assign option
exercises earlier and give notice of the assignments earlier. By receiving notification of their allocated option
exercises earlier, participants can manage more precisely their financial exposure by having the ability to engage
in other trading on that business day. This capacity should allow participants to manage their risks more effectively,
thus furthering the goal of protecting investors.





In addition, the Commission believes that the new method of allocation of option exercises is consistent with the
Act. By assigning option exercises according to a precise formula based on a pro rata allocation instead of a random
allocation, participants will be provided some basis for determining the likelihood that they will be assigned a
certain number of option exercises. The procedure also will assign the option exercises on a fairer basis.



III. Conclusion



For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of
the Act.



It is therefore Ordered,

 Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-93-03)
be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Amending its Margin Resolution </DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.





Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 9, 1993, The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-ICC-94-03) as
described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by ICC, a self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The proposed rule change amends the definition of ``premium margin'' in ICC's Margin Resolution. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, ICC has included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. ICC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The rule change amends the definition of the term ``premium margin'' to incorporate terminology that is more consistent
with the pricing practices of the commodities markets. With respect to certain unexercised or unassigned positions
in option contracts, ICC previously defined premium margin in pertinent part to be ``the current highest per-unit
asked premium quotation for options'' at the close of trading on the preceding trading day. For purposes of ICC's Margin
Resolution, the term ``option contracts'' includes both commodity and securities options. 

While the reference to the ``per-unit asked premium quotation'' is appropriate terminology with respect to securities
options, it is less appropriate with respect to commodity options. In the commodity markets, a single commodity option
price (i.e., a ``settlement price'') for each contract is disseminated at the close of trading rather than two prices
(i.e., bid and ask quotes) as in the equity markets. Accordingly, ICC's Margin Resolution is being amended to incorporate
the term ``settlement prices'' in the definition of premium margin where it is appropriate. The Margin Resolution
now defines premium margin in pertinent part to be ``the current highest per-unit asked premium quotation with respect
to an OCC Option, or the settlement price with respect to a commodity option for options.'' 

ICC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act
 in that it conforms the terminology used in ICC's Margin Resolution with the practices used in the commodities markets.






B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



ICC believes that the proposed rule change will not impose any burden on competition. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



ICC has not solicited or received any comments on the proposed rule change. 



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(i) of the Act
 and subparagraph (e)(1) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 because it constitutes a stated policy, practice,
or interpretation of an SRO with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule.
 At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such
rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for
the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 






IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-ICC-94-04 and should be submitted by June 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change
Modifying Clearing Fund Requirements</DOCTITLE>



May 18, 1994.




Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 notice is hereby given that on April 4, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule changes as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared by primarily NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule changes from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will modify NSCC's clearing fund requirements with respect to Depository Trust Company
(``DTC``) activity in order to more accurately reflect risk.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC currently applies a factor to the clearing fund requirement for members' non-CNS activity. The Depository Trust
Company (``DTC'') settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included
in the non-CNS calculation. The factor is applicable when certain amounts owed by the member to NSCC exceed the member's
excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor to the sponsored
member's DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has determined to add an additional advisory surveillance
criteria to cover the circumstance where the debit activity of the sponsored member is greater that its excess net
capital.






In File No. SR-NSCC-82-10,
 NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional clearing fund deposits from members
using the envelope settlement systems. Prior to that filing, NSCC's clearing fund formula required each member to
contribute an amount equal to 21/2% of the member's average daily debits and credits with NSCC. The amendment set forth
in File No. SR-NSCC-82-10 broke out the debits and credits associated with the envelope settlement
systems and required clearing fund deposits with respect to activity in those systems as follows:






Each Member would have to contribute an amount equal to 21/2NSCC of its average daily envelope settlement systems
debits and credits or 5% of its average daily envelope settlement systems debits, whichever was greater. In each case,
the amount would be multiplied by a factor which represented the number of times, if any, by which the Member's average
daily settlement debits exceeded its excess net capital.




The factor was initially capped at twenty but was later limited to three in File No. SR-NSCC-82-24.







As indicated in the File No. SR-NSCC-82-10, the primary purpose of the factor was to better protect
NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope settlement systems (i.e., that securities delivered through the
envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer in the event the receiver were to become
insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). The concern at the time of File No. SR-NSCC-82-10
arose from the stock loan business that was settled through the envelope settlement system. NSCC did not, however,
limit the application of the factor to just physical envelope deliveries but also applied it to the DTC settlement
activity of sponsored members. 

NSCC believes that the current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing
fund requirements. This is because the formula seeks to cover a risk relating to DTC activity which NSCC believes can
be adequately addressed without the application of the factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the factor
in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC activity, gives NSCC the ability
to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status under the circumstances where the factor previously
would have been applied and therefore will allow NSCC to continue to assess the risks associated with sponsored members'
DTC settlement activity.

The elimination of the application of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with
respect to DTC activity will more appropriately reflect the risks associated with such activity and will be consistent
with the way DTC addresses such risks for dual NSCC/DTC members. Thus, it will result in a more equitable distribution
of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored members. Therefore, NSCC believes that this rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A of the Act,
 and the rules thereunder.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC believes that the proposed rule changes will not have any impact or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



NSCC has neither solicited nor received any written comments




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:




(A) By order approve such proposed rule change or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the Submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-06
and should be submitted by June 15, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Ford Motor Company, Common
Stock, $1 Par Value) File No. 1-3950 </DOCTITLE>



May 19, 1994. 



Ford Motor Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''),
Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''). 

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:


According to the Company, in order to reduce expenses and simplify its stock exchange processes, the Company has decided
to withdraw those listings that are costly to maintain and have very low trading volumes. These include the Company's
listings on the BSE, CHX, and Phlx. 

According to the Company, it will continue listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and,
given the very low volume on the regional exchanges, it is not believed there will be any adverse impact on the market
or Company stockholders by the proposed withdrawals. 

Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Teleflex Incorporated, Common
Stock, $1.00 Par Value) File No. 1-5353</DOCTITLE>


May 19, 1994.


Teleflex Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on April 28, 1994
and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex.
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and the Amex. The
Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market therefor.
Any interested person may, on or before June 10, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Noise Compatibility Program for Hilo International Airport</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation, under the provisions of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise
Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of Federal and non-Federal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On November 4, 1993, the FAA
determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation, under part
150, were in compliance with applicable requirements. On May 3, 1994, the Administrator approved the Hilo International
Airport noise compatibility program. Eight of the ten recommendations of the program were approved, one was approved
in part, and one had no action.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Hilo International
Airport, effective May 3, 1994.


Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing incompatible
land uses and prevention of additional incompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR part 150;
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing incompatible land uses
around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional incompatible land uses;
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas pre-empted
by the Federal Government; and

<DOCNO> FR940525-2-00176 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940525-2-00098 </PARENT>

d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation submitted to the FAA on December 28, 1992, the noise exposure maps,
descriptions, and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January
1990 through December 1992. The Hilo International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance
with applicable requirements on November 4, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 23, 1993.

The Hilo International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions designed
for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to
the year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as
described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 4, 1993 and was required by
a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period shall be deemed to be an
approval of such program.

The submitted program contained ten (10) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed
its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied.
The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administration for Airports effective May 3, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for eight (8) of the ten (10) of the specific program elements. Approved program measures
include: Encourage relocation of military training operations; Displace Runway 8 landing threshold; Study sound
attenuation barrier; Study possible land exchanges with Hawaiian Home Lands; Monitor development proposals in
the Hilo International Airport environs; Annually monitor aircraft noise levels and operations at Hilo International
Airport; Conduct annual public information meetings on the progress of the part 150 program; Disclose airport noise
impacts for all real estate transfers; and Provide sound attenuation for impacted residences and public use structures.
One measure approved in part: Sound attenuation for public building approved and sound attenuation for residence
was disapproved. No action was taken on the measure to implement an informal runway use program.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Administrator on May 3, 1994. The
Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising the submittal, are available
for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the State of Hawaii.

Participation in the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; extension of request for participation.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice extends the invitation to State or local governments or other public authorities to make applications
for participation in the Congestion Pricing Pilot Program (Pilot Program) established by Section 1012(b) of the
Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). This document also contains a statement of future
direction for the Pilot Program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 1012(b) of the ISTEA (Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914) authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (the
Secretary) to create a Pilot Program by entering into cooperative agreements with up to five State or local governments
or other public authorities, to establish, maintain, and monitor congestion pricing pilot projects. Three of these
agreements may involve the use of tolls on the Interstate System notwithstanding 23 U.S.C. 129, as amended, and 301.
A maximum of $25 million is authorized for each of the fiscal years 1992 through 1997 to be made available to carry out
program requirements. Not more than $15 million can be made available each fiscal year to fund any single cooperative
agreement. 


In advance of completing its plan for implementing this program, the FHWA published a 

Federal Register

 notice on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22857), which presented general information about the Pilot Program and solicited public
comment on a number of implementation issues [Docket No. 92-94]. The comment period closed on June 29, 1992.
The FHWA published the initial solicitation for the Pilot Program in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1992 (57 FR 55293). The solicitation period closed on January 25, 1993. The results of the first solicitation
were summarized in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1993 (58 FR 33293). The June 16 notice also extended the solicitation period until October 14, 1993. 


Extension of Solicitation


Because the proposals received in response to the June 16 notice did not adequately meet the criteria for selection
as pilot projects at this time, the FHWA has determined that the goals of the Pilot Program can best be advanced if the
solicitation period is held open until further notice to encourage development of promising congestion pricing
experiments. 
To promote development of projects, the FHWA 
will use a small amount of Pilot Program funds 
to assist a limited number of areas in carrying out pre-project activities, such as the development of public-involvement
programs and activities designed to overcome institutional barriers to implementing congestion pricing. In addition,
more attention will be given to parking pricing and other pricing experiments that would be supportive of future highway
congestion pricing applications. The FHWA's program activities, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, will
focus on nurturing the development of market pricing experiments in areas showing the most promise for implementing
congestion pricing pilot projects.

Proposals to price high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to allow their use by single-occupant vehicles (HOV Buy-In)
have previously not been accepted for inclusion in the Pilot Program. The HOV Buy-In pricing concept was discussed
extensively at a recent National Academy of Sciences (NAS) symposium on congestion pricing. The sense of those discussions
was that in some circumstances this application of pricing should be considered on an experimental basis, and under
limited circumstances. The thinking was that this kind of pricing would improve the use of available capacity and
could be a way of introducing the notion of variable pricing for highways to the public. In response to these discussions,
and in anticipation of a likely NAS recommendation for experimentation with this type of pricing in its forthcoming
report on congestion pricing, the FHWA has decided to allow consideration of HOV Buy-In projects during this solicitation.
Further, because substantial economic benefits are likely to result from expediting truck movements in congested
urban corridors, the FHWA is also seeking a project proposal that would allow commercial freight vehicles to pay a
price for the right to use an underutilized HOV lane, either along with an HOV Buy-In for passenger vehicles, or as a
commercial freight vehicle Buy-In alone. Such proposals would have to ensure that the safety and operational efficiency
of the HOV lanes are not compromised. Proposals should address such considerations as size and type of commercial
freight vehicle in relation to the particular HOV lane design characteristics (e.g., HOV lanes must be barrier separated);
likely enforcement problems; lane capacity and traffic flow; and effects on corridor travel patterns. 
In order to protect the integrity of HOV programs, the FHWA will give priority to those HOV Buy-In proposals where it
is clear that an HOV lane is underutilized and where local officials can demonstrate that the experiment would not
undermine a long-term regional strategy to increase ride-sharing. In addition, areas proposing HOV Buy-In projects
are encouraged to use revenues from the project to promote improved transit service or other programs that will encourage
transit use and ride-sharing. Priority will also be given to proposals which will result in early implementation
of pricing activities. To gain acceptance as a pilot project, an HOV Buy-In project must incorporate the use of electronic
pricing technologies, HOV time-savings must be maintained, and enforcement authorities should have input to any
proposal. 
Proposals for funding of pre-project activities shall be submitted through the local Metropolitan Planning Organization
and State Department of Transportation to the FHWA through the appropriate Federal Highway Division Administrator.
Proposals will be reviewed by an Interagency Review Group comprised of representatives of FHWA, the Office of the
Secretary of Transportation, Federal Transit Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department
of Energy. Based on this review, a limited number of applicants will be invited to enter into negotiations with FHWA
to develop a cooperative agreement under which the pre-project activities will be carried out. 
Proposals for congestion pricing project implementation using one of the four remaining Pilot Program slots shall
be submitted via the same route. The selection criteria contained in the FHWA's 
November 24, 1992, 

Federal Register

 notice will continue to be used for selection of new pilot projects for implementation. To obtain further information
contact Mr. John T. Berg or Mr. James R. Link at the address provided under

<DOCTITLE>Petitions for Waivers of Compliance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration
(FRA) has received requests for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The individual petitions are described below, including the parties seeking relief, the regulatory provisions
involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.



Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI-94-2



The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 229, Locomotive Safety Standards, for locomotives
used in switching service in Memphis, Tennessee.

The BN is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows,
end plates_for locomotives used in the Tennessee Yard Terminal, Memphis. The BN is requesting that it be permitted
to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above the top of the rail from the maximum allowable 6 inches to 9 inches.
The BN states that with the pilots at the maximum height of 6 inches above the top of rail, both the pilot and the retarder
equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard. This waiver would only apply to locomotives
used exclusively for hump service in the Tennessee Yard Terminal.



Union Pacific Railroad Company (UP), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI-94-4



The UP is seeking a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part 229, Locomotive Safety Standards, for
locomotives used in switching service in all of its hump yards.

The UP is seeking a waiver of compliance with  229.123 of the Locomotive Safety Standards_Pilots, snowplows,
end plates_for locomotives used in switch service in the hump yards located at Hinkle, Oregon, North Platte, Nebraska,
North Little Rock, Arkansas, Ft. Worth, Texas, Pocatello, Idaho, and Los Angeles, California.


The UP and the Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (MP) collectively own or lease 100 percent of the affected locomotives
used in the hump yards. The UP is requesting that it be permitted to increase the height of the locomotive pilot above
the top of the rail from the maximum permissible 6 inches to 83/4 inches in order to achieve sufficient clearance and
avoid damage to the locomotives and retarders. With the pilots at the maximum permissible height of 6 inches above
the top of rail, the pilot and the retarder equipment are being damaged when the locomotives go through the hump yard.
This waiver would only apply to locomotives used exclusively in switching service in the hump yards. Further, the
UP states that safety of its operations in hump yards will not be adversely affected. All affected locomotives will
be brought back to the maximum permissible clearance of 6 inches before used in any other service.



Northeast Illinois Railroad Corporation (Metra), Waiver Petition Docket Number LI-93-15



Metra is seeking a waiver of compliance with 49 CFR 229.133 Locomotive Conspicuity, Minimum Standards for Auxiliary
External Lights (ditch lights), for passenger equipment used in the Chicago metropolitan area.

Metra owns the former Rock Island, Milwaukee Road and Illinois Central Commuter service and oversees, through the
purchase of service agreements, the Chicago and North Western, Norfolk Southern (Southwest Service) and Burlington
Northern Computer Service. Metra has a fleet of 134 passenger locomotives, 7 switcher locomotives, 165 electric
multiple unit locomotives (M.U. locomotives) and 161 non-M.U. control cab locomotives (cab car) which fall under
the jurisdiction of 49 CFR 229.133. Metra has developed schedules and placed material purchase orders to install
ditch lights on its passenger equipment.


Metra is seeking a waiver from the interim rule requirement for the minimum height of the ditch lights on 165 MU locomotives,
which are currently being rebuilt. Section 229.133(b)(1) requires that two ditch lights shall be placed at the front
of the locomotive, not less than 36 inches nor more than 84 inches above top of rail. Metra says that the ditch lights
will be installed at a height of 25 inches above top of the rail, which is below the FRA minimum of 36 inches. Further,
at this height the lights have proven to be very conspicuous. Metra states that a higher location on these MU locomotives
would present an unnecessary financial burden that would not measurably enhance or improve the conspicuity of the
ditch lights. The burden would be attributable to extensive carbody and control cab modifications necessary to adapt
the car body structure for the mounting of recessed ditch lights at the 36 inch minimum height. Further, Metra states
that one route is parallelled on both sides by public streets, and separated by concrete barriers. If the height of
the ditch lights was raised above 25 inches above top of rail, the lights would be directed into the line of sight of vehicles
traveling next to the track and could contribute to motor vehicle accidents.

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number LI-94-2) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications
received before June 28, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that
date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available
for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street
SW., Washington, DC 20590.

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waivers of Compliance </DOCTITLE>



In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department of request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements
of Federal regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature
of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 



Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWX), Docket Number SA-92-4 



The TPWX on behalf of the Texas State Railroad (TSR) seeks a waiver of compliance from certain Sections of 49 CFR part
231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards. The TSR is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR 231.29
``Road Locomotives with corner stairways'' which requires that road locomotives with corner stairways must be equipped
with (a) uncoupling levers that can be operated safely from the bottom stairway opening step as well as from the ground
level, and (b) the vertical handholds and horizontal and handholds as prescribed in 231.30(e) and (g). The TSR is also
requesting a waiver of 49 CFR 231.30 ``Locomotives used in switching service'' which requires that each locomotive
used in switching service be equipped with four side switching steps, each of which has a minimum width of 24 inches
and a minimum depth of 12 inches for locomotives built after March 31, 1977, and for locomotives built prior to April
1, 1977, a minimum width of 18 inches and the minimum depth of 8 inches. 

The locomotive TSRR number 1 for which this waiver is requested is a 45-ton center cab, industrial switcher type locomotive.
This type of locomotive has a side switching step and ladder configuration located at each of the four corners which
are narrower and of less depth than those required by the Safety Appliance Standards. The railroad states that the
construction of this locomotive does not permit it to be retrofitted with side switching steps different than it currently
possesses. 

Locomotive TSRR number 1 is used primarily in shop areas to move dead locomotives and cars in the work area. Occasionally
when the road locomotives are out of service, it is used on a light work train. The switchman will mount or dismount the
locomotive only when it is stopped. 

Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 

All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number SA-92-4 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before June 28, 1994,
will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far
as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC

B.A.T. Incorporated, 
Receipt of Petition for Temporary Exemption From 
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 


B.A.T. (``Battery Automated Transportation'') Inc. of West Valley City, Utah, has petitioned to be exempted from
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection 

for Geo Metro sedans that it converts to electric power. The basis of the petition is that an exemption will facilitate
the development and field evaluation of low-emission motor vehicles. 
Notice of receipt of the petition is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject and does not represent
any judgment of the agency on the merits of the petition (49 CFR 555.7(a)). 
Petitioner has already been excused from compliance with the crash test provision of Standard No. 208 by NHTSA Temporary
Exemption No. 93-3 which expires August 1, 1995 (see 58 FR 45549). Although that exemption is not vehicle-specific
by its terms, petition had been made only on behalf of 1993 model Ford Ranger pickup trucks to be converted to electric
power. Thus, rather than providing the petitioner with an interpretation that the current exemption extends to sedans
as well as pickups, NHTSA concluded that the public should be offered an opportunity to comment on B.A.T.'s latest
request. 
As before, the basis of the petition is that a temporary exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation
of a low-emission motor vehicle, as provided by 49 CFR 555.6(c). The petitioner will not manufacture more than 2,500
vehicles during any 12-month period that the exemption is in effect. 
Although the Geo Metro is certified by its original manufacturer as conforming with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards, petitioner has determined that the vehicles may not conform, after their modification,
with ``the requirements of crash tests of'' Standard No. 208 

Occupant Crash Protection. 

The petitioner intends to make arrangements with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to do computer simulated
crash testing. Any changes that are shown to be necessary will be incorporated in all future versions ``and will voluntarily
be retrofitted in earlier units.'' 
Although the petitioner has not provided specific arguments that an exemption would not unreasonably degrade the
safety of the vehicle, it believes that electric vehicles are safer because they carry no flammable substances and
do not have ``a very hot catalytic converter close to the gasoline tank.'' B.A.T. conversions do not ``emit hydrogen
gas from the batteries due to the addition of hydrocaps which catalyze any hydrogen gas formed when charging or discharging.''
Further, ``BAT 'Ultra Force' catalyst sharply reduces any gassing that might otherwise occur.'' 
Finally, the petitioner argued, granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because the vehicles ``are non polluting * * * and therefore can
be a major means of improving the quality of the air we breathe.'' 
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh
Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. 
All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered,
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent
possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will
be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below.

<DOCTITLE>Determination That Nonconforming 1978 Through 1981 Bristol VRT Buses Are Eligible for Importation</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses are eligible for importation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses that were not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation
into the United States because they have safety features that comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply
with all such standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified motor vehicle, section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(II)
of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

Double Decker Bus Company of Denver, Colorado (Registered Importer No. R-93-015) petitioned NHTSA to
determine whether 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA
published notice of the petition on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12635) to afford an opportunity for public comment. As described
in that notice, the petitioner claimed that the 1978 through 1981 Bristol VRT buses have safety features that comply
with Standard Nos. 102 

Transmission Shift Lever Sequence * * *

 (based on schematic diagram indicating starter interlock protection and photograph showing shift lever positions),
103 

Defrosting and Defogging Systems

 (based on statement and photograph indicating that system incorporates electrically heated elements and heated
air blowers), 104 

Windshield Wiping and Washing Systems

 (based on statement and photographs indicating that system is pneumatically driven and offers full coverage of windshield
at two set speeds and intermittently), 107 

Reflecting Surfaces

 (based on statement and photographs indicating that reflective glare is kept to a minimum in the driver's cab through
the use of matt black paint on the windshield wipers, the rearview mirror frame, the dash, and the cab walls), 120 

Tire Selection and Rims for Motor Vehicles other than Passenger Cars

 (based on statement and photographs showing certification markings on tires supplied by vehicle purchaser and rims
selected by petitioner, and describing contents of tire information placard), 121 

Air Brake Systems

 (based on statement, photographs, and specifications indicating that vehicles are equipped with air compressors
and associated equipment that provide greater cut-in pressure than 85 p.s.i.), 124 

Accelerator Control Systems

Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the

the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300E.
Champagne has submitted information indicating that Daimler Benz A.G., the company that manufactured the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300E, certified that vehicle as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards and offered
it for sale in the United States.

The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 230E to the 300E, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 230E, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1991 model 300E that
was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1991 model 230E is identical to the certified 1991 model 300E with respect
to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(II), permits a nonconforming motor vehicle to be admitted into the United
States if its safety features comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence as NHTSA determines to be adequate.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register 

of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register.

Europa International, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico (Registered Importer No. R-91-002) petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs
are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on March 29, 1994 (59 FR
14708) to afford an opportunity for public comment. As described in that notice, the petitioner claimed that 1990,
1991, 1992, and 1994 Mercedes-Benz Gelaendewagen 300GE (long wheel base Type 463) MPVs have safety features that

<DOCTITLE>U.S. Electricar, Inc.; Receipt of Petition for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Five Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standards </DOCTITLE>


U.S. Electricar Corporation of Sebastopol, California, has petitioned for renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption
No. 92-3 from five Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see 57 FR 30997). At the time the exemption was granted,
the petitioner was known as Solar Electric Engineering, Inc. As of the date of its petition, 70 vehicles had been sold
under the Exemption. 
Exemption No. 93-2 expires on June 1, 1994. The petition for renewal of the exemption was received on March 31,
1994. In accordance with agency regulations, when a petition for renewal has been filed not later than 60 days before
the termination date of an exemption, the exemption does not terminate until the Administrator grants or denies the
petition for renewal (49 CFR 555.8(e)). 
Notice of receipt of the petition is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject and does not represent
any judgment of the agency on the merits of the petition (49 CFR 555.7(a)). 

The basis of U.S. Electricar's original petition and its petition for renewal is that a temporary exemption would
facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low emission motor vehicle. Renewal is sought for the same portions
of the same five standards as are covered by the original exemption. These are paragraphs S4.2 and S4.3 of Standard
No. 103 Windshield Defrosting and Defogging Systems, ``the service brake requirements of S5.1 and the parking brake
performance requirements of S5.2'' of Standard No. 105 Hydraulic brake Systems, paragraph S3.3 of Standard No. 201
Occupant Protection in Interior Impact, Standard No. 204 Steering Control Rearward Displacement, and paragraphs
S4.1.4.1 and S4.2.2 of Standard No. 208 Occupant Crash Protection. 
Under the original exemption, petitioner converted Ford Escorts, Chevrolet S-10 pickup trucks ``and other
FMVSS-compliant vehicles'' to electric power. It has now substituted conversions of Geo Prizm sedans for Ford Escorts.
Although the vehicles to be converted are certified by their original manufacturers to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards, the modifications that Electricar performs add weight to the converted
vehicle and may affect its compliance with the standards. Until it has satisfied itself that the conversions conform,
petitioner has requested appropriate exemptions. The modifications that petitioner performs include removal
of the internal combustion engine and fuel system modification or replacement of the transmission and installation
of an electric propulsion system and battery pack. Springs, shock absorbers, tires and other components are removed
and replaced with new, heavier-duty equipment as required to accommodate the weight of the battery pack added to the
vehicle. An electric heater defroster is installed and an electric vacuum pump for the vacuum-assisted brake system
is added to the vehicle. 
The electric vacuum pump is intended to improve brake performance and has been developed during the term of the current
exemption. Petitioner has also implemented a ``Safety Development Program'' using vehicle crashworthiness computer
simulation and physical testing. Preliminary results from a frontal barrier crash test of the S-10 conversion
indication compliance with Standard No. 208 under these conditions ``without ejection of batteries or spillage
of battery electrolyte.'' The company has also been field testing an electrical safety system which ``ensures that
the primary battery pack remains electrically isolated from the vehicle chassis, and de-energizes the system''
if the condition is violated. 
Electricar asserts that an exemption would not unreasonably degrade motor vehicle safety as electric vehicles are
intended for urban use and are therefore generally operated at lower speeds. Under a renewed exemption the company
will continue its safety development and field evaluations with a view to ensuring that its vehicles fully comply
before the end of the renewed exemption period. 
Finally, the petitioner argues that renewal of the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the
objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Its vehicles reduce air pollution at street level
and lessen the dependence of the United States on importation of petroleum. 
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above. Comments should refer to the Docket
number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. 
All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated below will be considered,
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent
possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will
be published in the 

Federal Register

 pursuant to the authority indicated below. 
Comment closing date: June 24, 1994.

Projects Under the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act of 1988, as Amended 


<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with 
Disabilities Act of 1988, as amended (the Act), directs the 
Secretary to make site visits to States with development grants 
under Title I of the Act prior to funding extension grants for 
the fourth and fifth years of the projects. The statute further 
directs the Secretary to solicit public comment about the 
performance of the projects. In 1994, the Department will make 
site visits to Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, 
Montana, New Hampshire and South Carolina during the end of May 
and in June. Each of these States is in the final year of a 
three-year development grant project authorized under Title I of 
the Act and is eligible to apply for a two-year extension award. 


The purpose of the Act is to establish comprehensive, 
consumer-responsive statewide systems of technology-related 
assistance for persons of all ages with disabilities. The 
extension awards will be governed by the provisions of the Act, 
which was recently amended by the Technology-Related Assistance 
for Individuals with Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994. The 
Act as amended includes greater emphasis on systems change, 
services to minority populations, and geographic factors for the 
distribution of resources, and also established a program of 
protection and advocacy services designed to increase access to 
technology, which all projects must support. The Secretary is 
soliciting public comment from individuals with disabilities and

Cooperative Demonstration Program (Manufacturing Technologies) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final priority for fiscal year 1994.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces an absolute priority for fiscal year (FY) 1994, using funds appropriated in FY 1993, under
the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act. Under the absolute priority for manufacturing technologies, funds will be reserved for a competition
only among applications proposing to develop and demonstrate a national training model to overcome skill shortages
in the application of new technologies to the manufacturing process within the American machine tool industry.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The application of new technologies to the manufacturing process is key to the restoration of American competitiveness.
In a 1989 Memorandum of Understanding, the Department of Education, the Department of Labor, the Department of Defense,
and the Department of Commerce agreed that there was a national need to train multi-skilled machine technicians capable
of installing, integrating, maintaining, diagnosing, repairing, and modifying technologically advanced equipment
systems. However, high-technology manufacturing systems can be implemented only where the skills exist to use them
at peak efficiency. At present, this type of skill training is in short supply and the lack of these skills is a major
hindrance to increasing industrial automation in the United States. 


In fiscal year 1993, the House Appropriations Committee Report indicated that the Department should initiate a demonstration
program for critical technologies, as authorized by section 215 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1989,
which also provided for this type of demonstration. (H.R. Rep. No. 708, 102nd Cong., 2nd Sess. 160 (1993)). The competition
to be conducted under this priority notice is designed to address national skill shortages in advanced skills technologies
for manufacturing within the American machine tool industry. 
The Secretary hopes that this effort will serve to encourage the establishment of partnerships between vocational
education institutions and industry, which, in turn, should serve to bring new ideas and concepts from the research
laboratory to the manufacturing floor. The Secretary recognizes the importance of assisting manufacturing enterprises
to utilize new manufacturing technologies and to define the training and educational components necessary for successful
implementation of those new technologies. Models developed under this competition will enable innovative manufacturing
enterprises to become more technologically competitive both at home and abroad. 
Additionally, this program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the manufacturing
technologies priority announced by this notice directly supports Goal 6, which states that by the year 2000, every
adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy
and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 





Note: 

This notice of final priority does not solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition
is published in a separate notice in this issue of the 

Federal Register

Priority


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary funds under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority: 
Projects that_
(1) Design, develop, implement, test, evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate a national training model for overcoming
national skill shortages in the application of new technologies to the manufacturing process within the American
machine tool industry; 
(2) Focus on critical technologies needed for sustained economic growth, industrial productivity, and high-wage
jobs within the American machine tool industry, either by developing a new model, refining an existing model, or using
any portion of a model or combination of more than one model; and 
(3) Address the problems of high unemployment and training needs among young adults and out-of-school youth, particularly
minorities and women, in high-poverty, low-income major urban areas with major labor surpluses. 


Project Requirements 


Projects funded under this absolute priority must_
(a) Design, develop, implement, test, and evaluate a national training model that defines the training and educational
components necessary to train and educate manufacturing technicians in critical technologies related to the American
machine tool industry; 
(b) Demonstrate the effectiveness of the model developed by the project to a variety of businesses, industries, and
educational providers through demonstration activities that take place either on the premises of a postsecondary
training institution or on the premises of manufacturing companies that are training their workforces in advanced
technologies. Demonstration activities may be provided either directly or via satellite or other electronic linkage;

(c) Disseminate information nationally, and provide technical assistance to manufacturing companies and education
and training institutions, about the model developed by the project and its application to the manufacturing process,
as well as the teaching and learning methodologies and the curricular modules developed for training manufacturing
technicians, in order to facilitate the application of new technologies to the manufacturing process; 
(d) Involve an education-business partnership consisting of (1) one or more postsecondary education or training
institutions; and (2) one or more companies within the manufacturing industry. Consistent with their expertise,
all partners must participate in the design, development, implementation, evaluation, demonstration, and dissemination
of the training model for the education and training of manufacturing technicians; 
(e) In developing the training model_

(1) Identify and validate the occupational skill standards and related task lists needed for the manufacturing occupations
that are included in the project, utilizing, to the extent practicable_
(i) Validated common standards that have been developed by trade and professional associations, such as the National
Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) and the Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States
(V-TECS), or other standards that are being utilized in current training programs; and 
(ii) The skill standards that are currently being developed by organizations under contract with the Departments
of Education and Labor; and 
(2) Develop the curriculum, content, resources, and methodology necessary to conduct the educational program,
including the following elements: 
(i) Occupational training in areas of national skill shortages in the American machine tool industry, including
cross-training in integral manufacturing trades. 
(ii) Academic learning integrated with hands-on skill development. 
(iii) Curriculum and instructional processes that integrate practical experience and theoretical knowledge and
that provide out-of-school youth and other young adults, particularly minorities and women, with the skills needed
to make the transition from school to productive employment or to further technical training. 
(iv) Advanced manufacturing training and academic learning, within a production setting, needed to educate manufacturing
technicians at advanced world-competitive levels and to provide them with a portable skill certificate requiring
less than a baccalaureate degree. 
(v) Print and non-print materials (video mail, on-line education software and databases, computer-aided instruction,
laser discs, etc.) that encompass best-of-class knowledge sources and delivery systems and enable manufacturers

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 



In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations and priorities. However, for the following reasons, the Secretary is publishing
the absolute priority for manufacturing technologies demonstration projects without seeking public comment.
In FY 1993, the Department awarded a contract for the purpose of carrying out a manufacturing technologies demonstration
project under the cooperative demonstration authority. Similarly, the Department initially planned to award a
contract for this same purpose in FY 1994. However, the Department recently determined that a contract cannot be used
for funding manufacturing technologies demonstration projects in FY 1994. Since the FY 1993 appropriations available
for this competition must be obligated by September 30, 1994, solicitation of public comment on the absolute priority
for this FY 1994 manufacturing technologies competition would not allow sufficient time to publish the priority
in final form, announce and conduct the competition, and award the funds by September 30, 1994. Therefore, the Secretary
finds that solicitation of public comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C.
553(b)(B). 



Intergovernmental Review 



This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.


In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program.

Appendix C 



Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 

Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 

A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.


Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 

A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 

Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit under another competition? 

A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the requirements
of the competition to which it is submitted. 

Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 

A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.


Q. Will you help us prepare our application? 

A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that preapplication consultation is not
required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 

Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 

A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time. 

Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 

A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 

Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 

A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.

<TEXT>
 

Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 

A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 

Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 

A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we will request the project directors and evaluators
of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you should include annual trips for each to Washington,
D.C., in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 

Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 

A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 

Q. What happens during negotiations? 

A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved. 

Q. How do I provide an assurance? 

A. Except for SF-424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' simply state in writing that you are meeting
a proscribed requirement. 

Q. Where can copies of the 

Federal Register

, program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 

A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.
20402. Telephone: (202) 783-3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the
specific name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice should be referred to as follows:

(1) Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act) (Public Law 101-392, 104
Stat. 753 (1990)). 
(2) State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Programs and National Discretionary Programs of Vocational
Education Final Regulations, 34 CFR parts 400 and 426. 
(3) Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, and 86. 

Q. What are the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel and National Diffusion Network? 

A. The Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is the Department of Education's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness
of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other agencies. The National Diffusion Network
(NDN) is a Federally funded dissemination system that helps public and private schools, colleges, and other educational
institutions improve by sharing successful education programs, products, and processes. 

Regulations governing PEP and NDN are codified at 34 CFR Parts 785-789. For information about PEP, prospective
applicants may wish to read Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms, which contains
criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP. This publication, as well as information about NDN,
is available from RMC Research Corporation, 1000 Market Street, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801. Telephone 1-800-258-0802.
RMC Research Corporation can also provide information about consultants who have conducted evaluations that have
been approved by PEP.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  
  


Request for Comments on the draft Principles for Providing  
and Using Personal Information and their Commentary.  
  
The draft Principles for Providing and Using Personal  
Information and the associated Commentary are the first work  
product of the Information Infrastructure Task Force's Working  
Group on Privacy. They are intended to update the Code of Fair  
Information Practices that was developed in the early 1970s.  
While many of the Code's principles are still valid, the Code  
itself was developed in an era when paper records were the norm.  
  
The advent of the National Information Infrastructure has  
caused two things to change dramatically. No longer is  
information usage bound by the limitations of paper_the seamless  
web of networks linking us to each other is creating an  
interactive environment in which all of the participants must  
share certain responsibilities. Moreover, non-governmental usage  
rivals the government's, and is largely unregulated.  
  
The following Principles were developed with the goal of  
providing guidance to all participants in this new interactive  
world. The Working Group recognizes that the Principles cannot  
apply uniformly to all sectors. They must be carefully adapted to  
specific circumstances. Nevertheless, the developers believe that  
the responsibilities and relationships the Principles describe  
are basic ones. As such, they are intended to assist legislators,  
regulators, and companies as they develop codes of practice.  
  
The Working Group invites public comment on the Principles  
and Commentary. We are especially interested in understanding how  
the Principles would work in this new interactive electronic  
environment and particularly in non-governmental settings. Are  
they workable? How, if at all, should they be changed? We hope  
that those who obtain the Principles for review and comment will  
also share them as widely as possible with others who might be  
interested in them.  
  


Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information  
  




Preamble  
  


The United States is committed to building a National  
Information Infrastructure (NII) to meet the information needs of  
its citizens. This infrastructure, essentially created by  
advances in technology, is expanding the level of interactivity,  
enhancing communication, and allowing easier access to services.  
As a result, many more users are discovering new, previously  
unimagined uses for personal information. In this environment, we  
are challenged to develop new principles to guide participants in  
the NII in the fair use of personal information.  
  
Traditional fair information practices, developed in the age  
of paper records, must be adapted to this new environment where  
information and communications are sent and received over  
networks on which users have very different capabilities,  
objectives and perspectives. Specifically, new principles must  
acknowledge that all members of our society (government,  
industry, and individual citizens), share responsibility for  
ensuring the fair treatment of individuals in the use of personal  
information, whether in paper or electronic form. Moreover, the  
principles should recognize that the interactive nature of the  
NII will empower individuals to participate in protecting  
information about themselves. The new principles should also make  
it clear that this is an active responsibility requiring openness  
about the process, a commitment to fairness and accountability,  
and continued attention to security. Finally, principles must  
recognize the need to educate all participants about the new  
information infrastructure and how it will affect their lives.  
  
These ``Principles for Providing and Using Personal  
Information'' recognize the changing roles of government and  
industry in information collection and use. Thus they are  
intended to be equally applicable to public and private entities  
that collect and use personal information. However, these  
Principles are not intended to address all information uses and  
protection concerns for each segment of the economy or function  
of government. Rather, they should provide the framework from  
which specialized principles can be developed.  
  
  


I. General Principles for the National Information  
Infrastructure  
  


A. Information Privacy Principle  
  


1. Individuals are entitled to a reasonable expectation of  
information privacy.  
  


B. Information Integrity Principles  
  


Participants in the NII rely upon the integrity of the  
information it contains. It is therefore the responsibility of  
all participants to ensure that integrity. In particular,  
participants in the NII should, to the extent reasonable:  
  
Ensure that information is secure, using whatever means are  
appropriate;  
  
Ensure that information is accurate, timely, complete, and  
relevant for the purpose for which it is given.  
  


II. Principle for Information Collectors (i.e. entities that  
collect personal information directly from the individual)  
  


A. Collection Principle  
  


Before individuals make a decision to provide personal  
information, they need to know how it is intended to be used, how  
it will be protected, and what will happen if they provide or  
withhold the information. Therefore, collectors of this  
information should:  
  
1. Tell the individual why they are collecting the  
information, what they expect it will be used for, what steps  
they will take to protect its confidentiality and integrity, the  
consequences of providing or withholding information, and any  
rights of redress.  
  


III. Principles for Information Users (i.e. Information  
Collectors and entities that obtain, process, send or store  
personal information)  
  


A. Acquisition and Use Principles  
  


Users of personal information must recognize and respect the  
stake individuals have in the use of personal information.  
Therefore, users of personal information should:  
  
Assess the impact on personal privacy of current or planned  
activities before obtaining or using personal information;  
  
Obtain and keep only information that could reasonably be  
expected to support current or planned activities and use the  
information only for those or compatible purposes;  
  
Assure that personal information is as accurate, timely,  
complete and relevant as necessary for the intended use;  
  


B. Protection Principle  
  


Users of personal information must take reasonable steps to  
prevent the information they have from being disclosed or altered  
improperly. Such users should:  
  
1. Use appropriate managerial and technical controls to  
protect the confidentiality and integrity of personal  
information.  
  


C. Education Principle  
  


The full effect of the NII on both data use and personal  
privacy is not readily apparent, and individuals may not  
recognize how their lives can be affected by networked  
information. Therefore, information users should:  
  
1. Educate themselves, their employees, and the public about  
how personal information is obtained, sent, stored and protected,  
and how these activities affect others.  
  


D. Fairness Principles  
  


Because information is used to make decisions that affect  
individuals, those decisions should be fair. Information users  
should, as appropriate:  
  
Provide individuals a reasonable means to obtain, review, and  
correct their own information;  
  
Inform individuals about any final actions taken against them  
and provide individuals with means to redress harm resulting from  
improper use of personal information;  
Allow individuals to limit the use of their personal  
information if the intended use is incompatible with the original  
purpose for which it was collected, unless that use is authorized  
by law.  
  


IV. Principles for Individuals who Provide Personal  
Information  
  


A. Awareness Principles  
  


While information collectors have a responsibility to tell  
individuals why they want information about them, individuals  
also have a responsibility to understand the consequences of  
providing personal information to others. Therefore, individuals  
should obtain adequate, relevant information about:  
  
Planned primary and secondary uses of the information;  
  
Any efforts that will be made to protect the confidentiality  
and integrity of the information;  
  
Consequences for the individual of providing or withholding  
information;  
  
Any rights of redress the individual has if harmed by  
improper use of the information.  
  


B. Redress Principles  
  


Individuals should be protected from harm resulting from  
inaccurate or improperly used personal information. Therefore,  
individuals should, as appropriate:  
  
Be given means to obtain their information and be provided  
opportunity to correct inaccurate information that could harm  
them;  
  
Be informed of any final actions taken against them and what  
information was used as a basis for the decision;  
  
Have a means of redress if harmed by an improper use of their  
personal information.  
  


Principles for Providing and Using Personal Information  
  


Commentary  
  


1. With the initiation and expansion of the National  
Information Infrastructure (NII), 1A

1

 the information  
age is clearly upon us. The ability to access, collect, store,  
analyze, and disseminate data at an acceptable cost has never  
been greater, and continuing advances in computer and  
telecommunications technologies, especially interactive  
applications, will serve to ensure that the amount of  
electronically stored personal information and transactional data  
will continue to grow at a healthy pace.  
  




2. Cost is, of course, the overriding factor. Continually  
decreasing hardware, software and networking costs allow  
individuals and organizations to use data in ways that were  
previously, in a non-electronic world, cost-prohibitive. For  
example, if someone were interested in building a dossier on a  
citizen who had lived in four different states, that dossier  
could have been built ``manually'' by travelling from state to  
state (or hiring individuals in each state) to compile public  
records pertaining to that individual's birth, motor vehicle  
registration, driver's license, real property holdings, voting,  
etc. This would have required, however, filling out forms, paying  
fees, and perhaps waiting in long lines for record searches at  
various state and local office buildings. In short, it could be  
done, but it would have been a time-consuming and costly  
exercise; thus, it would not be done unless the reward for  
building this dossier were considerable. If the ultimate goal  
were to collate data on thousands of individuals,analytical  
processing costs would also be added to the mix.  
  
3. Today, such a dossier can be built in a matter of minutes,  
at minimal cost, assuming all the needed information is on-line.  
1A

 Indeed, with the NII, the assumption is that large  
amounts of sensitive information will be on line, and can be  
accessed, perhaps without authority, by a large number of network  
users. With advanced networking, each link in the chain_access,  
collection, storage, and analysis_becomes a cost-effective method  
of using information, as does the ability to disseminate the  
final collated product to others.  
  




4. Such networking offers considerable benefits. The NII  
holds forth the promise of greater public participation in  
society, advances in medical treatment and research, and quick  
verification of critical personal information (e.g., a gun  
purchaser's criminal record), just to name a few. There is,  
however, another issue: information privacy. To the extent that  
the ability to access, collect, store, analyze, and disseminate  
data has never been greater, the threat to personal information  
privacy has never been greater either. 1A

5. The truth is, the NII will only achieve its full potential  
if individual privacy is properly protected. Absent such  
protections, individuals may be reluctant to participate in the  
NII, fearful that the risks to personal privacy outweigh the  
benefits. Citizens should not have to make that choice; rather,  
they should be assured that the use of personal information will  
be appropriately limited. The adoption of fair information  
principles is a critical first step in that direction.  
  
6. Although Fair Information Principles currently exist, [see  
Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, Records,  
Computers and the Rights of Citizens, (Washington, D.C.,  
Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1973)], it is  
clearly time that they be rewritten to address the issues raised  
by our new electronic environment, as well as cover paper  
records. The most major concerns:  
  
(1) It is no longer governments alone that collect and use  
large quantities of personal data; the private sector clearly  
rivals the government sector in information usage. As such, these  
new principles should apply to both the government and private  
sectors.  
  
(2) The NII will, if it fulfills its promise, be interactive;  
i.e., individuals about whom data relates (so-called ``data  
subjects'') will become increasingly active participants,  
creating volumes of communicative and transactional data. To the  
extent that individuals are providing information about  
themselves, they too should have obligations when using the NII.  
  
(3) The transport vehicles for this information (the  
networks) are vulnerable to abuse; thus, the reliability of the  
network itself becomes critical to the future success of the NII.  
(4) Traditional ethical rules, long-accepted when dealing  
with tangible objects, are not easily applied in the new  
electronic environment, and all NII participants must be educated  
in the proper use of the NII. Consider, for example, how an  
individual who would never trespass in the home of another might  
attempt to justify computer hacking as an intellectual exercise.  
Indeed, what constitutes a proper use of the NII or NII  
information might not be intuitively obvious. Whether a  
particular use is acceptable may depend on a host of factors  
including, but by no means limited to, the purpose for which the 
data was collected, whether the use is compatible with that 
purpose, and whether the use is specifically authorized by law. 
In such an environment, individuals need to be educated about the 
proper use of both the NII and the information it contains. 
 
7. As ambitious as the task is, these Principles attempt to 
address these issues. That said, one must recognize the 
limitations inherent in any such principles. First, the 
Principles are not intended to have the force of law. Broad 
sweeping principles provide a framework for addressing fair 
information practices, but any specific regulatory implementation 
must be sector by sector. This is because each information sector 
(e.g., medical, financial, law enforcement, national security, 
research and statistics) has specific and unique needs that 
cannot be addressed by general principles. 
 
8. Second, the Principles are only intended to apply 
domestically; although, to the best of our knowledge, these 
Principles are in accord with current international guidelines 
regarding personal privacy and data protection, and should not 
hinder the ongoing development of an international information 
infrastructure. 
 
9. Third, the Principles only address information 
identifiable to a living individual. It makes little sense to 
restrict the use of information that does not relate to an 
identifiable living person, and to do so would unduly hamper 
researchers and others who use large quantities of data for 
generic statistical purposes. 
 
10. Finally, although the Principles are written broadly, 
there will no doubt be times when their strict application would 
be inappropriate. For example, public safety could be undermined 
if law enforcement had to seek a data subject's approval before 
obtaining transactional records relevant to an ongoing criminal 
investigation on the theory that this use was incompatible with 
the purpose for which the records were originally created. To 
account for such cases, the words ``as appropriate'' or ``to the 
extent reasonable'' appear in the Principles. This is not to 
suggest, however, that the Principles need not be rigorously 
adhered to. To the contrary, the need to diverge from a given 
principle should be the exception, not the rule, and should only 
occur when there is an compelling reason. For in the end, it is 
adherence to these Principles that is critical to developing 
trust between data users and data subjects in the electronic 
information age. 
 


General Principles for the National Information 
Infrastructure 
 


11. We begin with the three principles that apply to all NII 
participants: information collectors, information users, and 
individuals (``data subjects''). These three principles, relating 
to privacy and information integrity, provide the underpinnings 
for the successful implementation of the NII. They state clearly 
that individuals are entitled to a reasonable expectation of 
information privacy, and that efforts should be made to ensure 
that information is adequately protected and used appropriately. 
 
12. If the NII is to be trusted, participants must have a 
reasonable expectation of privacy in personal information. 
Although individuals harbor subjective expectations of privacy, 
these must be honored only to the extent that society is prepared 
to recognize those subjective expectations as objectively 
reasonable. For example, an individual who posts an unencrypted 
personal message in an area of a bulletin board service that is 
provided for open, public messages cannot reasonably expect that 
his/her message will only be read by the individual listed in the 
salutation. Where a subjective expectation of privacy is made 
clear and is objectively reasonable, however, individuals should 
have their privacy respected. 
 
13. NII participants must also be able to rely upon the 
integrity of the information contained in and transmitted through 
the NII. This will be the case only if the information is secure 
from improper disclosure and alteration, and if the information 
is accurate, timely, complete, and relevant for the purpose for 
which it is used. The responsibility of providing adequate 
security and reliable information falls properly on all 
participants in the NII. 
 
14. We recognize, of course, that individuals and 
organizations do not always provide accurate and complete data 
when requested. Large data brokers, as well as privacy advocates, 
may intentionally provide false data as a method of monitoring 
data flow. For example, an individual who misspells his name 
slightly when dealing with one company and then receives mail, 
with the name similarly misspelled, from a second company, may 
now be aware that the first company has disseminated his name to 
others. We do not intend to suggest that any falsehood violates 
this principle. It would violate this principle, however, to 
provide false information to create some improper result (such as 
receiving illegitimate benefits or injuring another). 
 
 


Responsibilities of Original Collectors (i.e., Entities that 
Collect Information Directly from the Individual) of Personal 
Information 
 


15. One of the most alluring features of the NII_easy access 
to and dissemination of information_also provides one of its most 
vexing problems: it is impossible for an individual to identify 
all the other individuals and organizations that may possess some 
personal information about himself or herself. At the risk of 
over-simplification, there are essentially two types of data 
users: those who collect information directly from the data 
subject, and those who do not. By necessity, the rules for these 
two groups must differ. 
 
16. Those who collect information directly from the 
individual should inform the data subject 
 
(1) how the information collected will be used, 
 
(2) whether the information will remain confidential and be 
protected against improper access or alteration, and 
 
(3) the consequences of providing or withholding the 
requested information. 
 
The fulfilling of these obligations will ensure that 
individuals have a meaningful opportunity to exercise sound 
judgment in accordance with the Principles for Individuals Who 
Provide Personal Information. Juxtaposed, the Principles for 
Information Collectors and Principles for Individuals Who Provide 
Personal Information highlight the true interactive nature of the 
NII and the ideal symbiotic relationship between data collectors 
and data subjects. 
 
17. It is simply impossible, of course, to impose these 
Information Collector obligations on entities that have no direct 
relationship with the individual. If every recipient of data were 
required to contact every i
