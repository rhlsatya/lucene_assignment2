</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, Federal
Wage System wage area for pay-setting purposes. The host activity for the Oscoda-Alpena wage area survey, Wurtsmith
Air Force Base, closed at the end of June 1993. No other activity in the Oscoda-Alpena wage area had the capability to
conduct the local wage survey scheduled to begin in the wage area in August 1993. This regulation redefines all counties
presently included in the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, wage area to the area of application of the Northwestern Michigan
wage area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 7, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 64365) to abolish the Oscoda-Alpena, Michigan, wage area
for pay-setting purposes and reassign its constituent counties to the Northwestern Michigan wage area as areas of
application. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments during the comment
period. Therefore, the interim rule is being adopted as a final rule.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final rule to abolish the Santa Clara, California, Nonappropriated
Fund (NAF) Federal Wage System wage area for paysetting purposes. The Santa Clara NAF wage area is composed of Santa
Clara County (survey area) and San Mateo County (area of application). The host activity for the Santa Clara NAF wage
area survey, Naval Air Station Moffett Field, will close on July 1, 1994, and did not have the capability to carry out
the local wage survey scheduled to begin in the Santa Clara NAF wage area in September 1993. No other installation in
the Santa Clara NAF wage area had the capability to conduct a wage survey. This regulation redefines Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties to the area of application of the Alameda-Contra Costa, California, NAF wage area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 29, 1993, OPM published an interim rule (58 FR 68715) to abolish the Santa Clara, California, NAF wage area
for pay-setting purposes and redefine its constituent counties to the Alameda-Contra Costa, California, NAF wage
area as areas of application. The interim rule provided a 30-day period for public comment. OPM received no comments
during the comment period. Therefore, the interim rule is adopted as a final rule.

Civil Service Retirement System; Reemployment of Annuitants



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations concerning the reemployment of disability
annuitants. These regulations merely eliminate duplicative regulatory language and are intended to clarify existing
regulations.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 15, 1993, OPM published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

, (58 FR 48265), that, among other things, added subpart D of part 837 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, concerning
reemployment of disability annuitants. This change was effective October 15, 1993.


On September 22, 1993, OPM published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

, (58 FR 49177), effective October 22, 1993, that contained  831.1211 entitled ``Reemployment of disability
annuitants.'' The September 22 publication contained many, but not all, of the instructions contained in the new
subpart D of part 837.



The publication of two sets of substantially identical rules on the reemployment of disability annuitants was inadvertent.
Retaining these rules in two different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations could cause confusion, especially
if a reader were to review  831.1211 alone, and erroneously conclude that he or she had reviewed the entirety
of the rules governing reemployment of disability annuitants. Also, the existence of  831.1211 is inconsistent
with the Office of Personnel Management's stated intent to incorporate all retirement program rules affecting reemployed
annuitants in part 837. Consequently, OPM has decided to delete  831.1211.

Under sections 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving
the general notice of proposed rulemaking and for making these amendments effective October 22, the same effective
date as the regulations published on September 22, 1993. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this
final rule only corrects nonsubstantive errors in the recently published regulations. This date is appropriate
for the same reason.


Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation only makes nonsubstantive, technical corrections in regulations which only affect the employment
of disability annuitants.

Tobacco Inspection; Growers' Referendum Results 



<AGENCY>

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains the determination with 
respect to the referendum on the merger of Windsor, 
Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina, to become 
the consolidated market of Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. A mail referendum was conducted 
during the period of April 4-8, 1994, among tobacco growers 
who sold tobacco on these markets in 1993 to determine 
producer approval/disapproval of the designation of these 
three markets as one consolidated market. Growers approved 
the merger. Therefore, for the 1994 and succeeding flue-cured marketing seasons, the Windsor, Williamston, and

Robersonvile, North Carolina, tobacco markets shall be 
designated as and called Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. 
The regulations are amended to reflect this new designated 
market. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A notice was published in the 
March 25, 1994, issue of the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4124) announcing that a referendum would be conducted among active 
flue-cured producers who sold tobacco on either Windsor, 
Williamston, or Robersonville, during the 1993 season to 
ascertain if such producers favored the consolidation. 



The notice of referendum announced the determination by the Secretary that the consolidated market of Windsor-Williamston-Robersonvile,
North Carolina, would be 
designated as a flue-cured tobacco auction market and 
receive mandatory, Federal grading of tobacco sold at 
auction for the 1994 and succeeding seasons, subject to the 
results of the referendum. The determination was based on 
the evidence and arguments presented at a public hearing 
held in Williamston, North Carolina, on November 19, 1993, 
pursuant to applicable provisions of the regulations issued 
under the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended. The 
referendum was held in accordance with the provisions of the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 511d) and
the 
regulations set forth in 7 CFR 29.74. 

Ballots for the April 4-8 referendum were mailed to 
1,054 producers. Approval required votes in favor of 
the proposal by two-thirds of the eligible voters who cast 
valid ballots. The department received a total of 365 
responses: 274 eligible producers voted in favor of the 
consolidation; 72 eligible producers voted against the 
consolidation; and 19 ballots were determined to be invalid. 

The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12788, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 

Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of 
Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, full 
consideration has been given to the potential economic 
impact upon small business. Most tobacco producers and many tobacco warehouses are small businesses as defined in
the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. It has been determined that 
this action will not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, and will not 
substantially affect the normal movement of the commodity in the marketplace.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this final rule is to codify the national marketing quotas and price support levels for the 1994 crops
for several kinds of tobacco announced by press release on March 1, 1994. 


In accordance with the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the
1994 marketing quotas to be as follows: Fire-cured (type 21), 2.150 million pounds; fire-cured (types 22-23),
40.4 million pounds; dark air-cured (types 35-36), 10.6 million pounds; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 131,000
pounds; cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55), 9.3 million pounds; and cigar-filler (type
46), zero pounds. 
This rule is necessary to adjust the production levels of these kinds of tobacco to more fully reflect supply and demand
conditions. 
In accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949 (the 1949 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the 1994 levels
of support to be as follows (in cents per pound): Fire-cured (type 21), 140.7; fire-cured (types 22-23), 148.3;
dark air-cured (types 35-36), 127.3; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 124.5; cigar-filler and binder (types
42-44 and 53-55), 108.4; and cigar-filler (type 46), 84.4.



This is required by section 106 of the 1949 Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Executive Order 12866 


This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 


Executive Order 12778 


The final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. The provisions of
this rule do not preempt State laws, are not retroactive, and do not involve administrative appeals. 


Federal Assistance Program 


The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are: Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this final rule since neither ASCS
nor the Commodity Credit Corporation is required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any provision of law to publish a notice of proposed
rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this rule. 


Executive Order 12372 


This activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24,
1983). 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The amendments to 7 CFR part 723 set forth in this final rule do not contain any new or revised information collection
requirements that require clearance through the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 
44 U.S.C. 35. 


Statutory Background 


This final rule is issued pursuant to the provisions of the 1938 Act and the 1949 Act.

 

On March 1, 1994, the Secretary determined and announced the national marketing quotas and price support levels for
the 1994 crops of fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22-23), dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia
sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55), and cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccos.
A number of related determinations were made at the same time, which this final rule affirms. On the same date, the Secretary
also announced that referenda would be conducted by mail with respect to fire-cured (types 21-23) and dark air-cured
(types 35-36) tobaccos.

During March 28-31, 1994, eligible fire-cured 
(types 21-23) and dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco producers voted in separate referenda to determine
whether such producers disapprove marketing quotas for the 1994, 1995, and 1996 marketing years (MYs) for these tobaccos.
Of the producers voting, 89.8 percent favored marketing quotas for fire-cured tobacco and 90.0 percent favored marketing
quotas for dark air-cured tobacco. Accordingly, quotas and price supports for both kinds are in effect for the 1994
MY. 
In accordance with section 312(a) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary of Agriculture is required to proclaim not later than
March 1 of any MY with respect to any kind of tobacco, other than burley and flue-cured tobacco, a national marketing
quota for any such kind of tobacco for each of the next three MYs if such MY is the last year of three consecutive years
for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effect. With respect to both fire-cured (type 21-23)
and dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobaccos, the 1993 MY is the last year of three such consecutive years. Accordingly,
marketing quotas for fire-cured (types 21-23) and dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobaccos have been proclaimed
for each of the three MYs beginning October 1, 1994; October 1, 1995; and October 1, 1996. 
Sections 312 and 313 of the 1938 Act also provide that the Secretary shall announce not later than March 1 of any MY the
reserve supply level and the total supply of fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22-23), dark air-cured
(types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55),
and cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccos for the MY beginning 
October 1, 1993, and the amounts of the national marketing quotas, national acreage allotments, national acreage
factors for apportioning the national acreage allotments (less reserves) to old farms, and the amounts of the national
reserves and parts thereof available for (1) new farms and (2) making corrections and adjusting inequities in old
farm allotments for fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types 22-23), dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia
sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55), and cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco
for the MY beginning October 1994. 
Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kind of tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect
or for which marketing quotas have not been disapproved by producers. With respect to the 1994 crop of the six kinds
of tobacco which are the subject of this rule, the respective maximum level of support is determined in accordance
with section 106 of the 1949 Act. 
The announcement of the price support levels for the 1994 crops of the six kinds of tobacco must be made insofar as practicable
before the beginning of the planting season. 


Marketing Quotas 


Section 312(b) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the amount of the national marketing quota for a kind of tobacco
is the total quantity of that kind of tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during such MY a supply of
such tobacco equal to the reserve supply level. 
Section 313(g) of the 1938 Act provides that the Secretary may convert the national marketing quota into a national
acreage allotment for apportionment to individual farms. 
Since producers of these kinds of tobacco generally produce less than their respective national acreage allotments
would allow, it has been determined that a larger quota would be necessary to make available production equal to the
reserve supply level. The amount of the national marketing quota so announced may, not later than the following March
1, be increased by not more than 20 percent if the Secretary determines that such increase is necessary in order to meet
market demands or to avoid undue restriction of marketings in adjusting the total supply to the reserve supply level.

Section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act defines ``reserve supply level'' as the normal supply, plus 5 percent thereof,
to ensure a supply adequate to meet domestic consumption and export needs in years of drought, flood, or other adverse
conditions, as well as in years of plenty. The ``normal supply'' is defined in section 301(b)(10)(B) of the 1938 Act
as a normal year's domestic consumption and exports, plus 175 percent of a normal year's domestic use and 65 percent
of a normal year's exports as an allowance for a normal year's carryover. A ``normal'' year's domestic consumption
is defined in section 301(b)(11)(B) of the Act as the average quantity produced and consumed in the United States during
the 10 MYs immediately preceding the MY in which such consumption is determined, adjusted for current trends in such
consumption.

A normal year's exports is defined in section 301(b)(12) of the 1938 Act as the average quantity produced in and exported
from the United States during the 10 MYs immediately preceding the MY in which such exports are determined, adjusted
for current trends in such exports. 

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, the 
Secretary is authorized to establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment in an amount equivalent
to not more than 1 percent of the national acreage allotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments,
adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms. The Secretary has determined that the national
reserve, noted herein, for the 1994 crop of each of these kinds of tobacco is adequate for these purposes. 

On December 21, 1993, a proposed rule was published 
(58 FR 67376) in which interested persons were requested to comment with respect to these issues. 



Discussion of Comments 



Thirty-one written responses were received during the comment period which ended February 4, 1994. Some respondents
discussed more than one kind of tobacco. A summary of these comments by kind of tobacco follows: 

(1) 

Fire-cured (type 21) tobacco. 

Eight comments were received. Four comments recommended that quotas be increased by 5 percent. Two others recommended
that the marketing quotas be increased by 10 percent from the 1993 MY while two more requested an unspecified increase.


(2) 

Fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco. 

Four comments were received, all recommending a five percent increase from the 1993 marketing quota. 

(3) 

Dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco. 

Five comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a 5-percent decrease to a 10-percent decrease in the quota.


(4) 

Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco. 

Eight comments were received. Recommendations ranged from a 
5-percent to a 20-percent increase in quota. 

(5) 

Cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) tobacco. 

Six comments were received. These comments ranged from no change in quota to a 35-percent decrease in quota. 

(6) 

Cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. 

No comments were 
received. 

Based upon a review of these comments and the latest available statistics of the Federal Government, which appear
to be the most reliable data available, the following determinations have been made. 



(1) Fire-Cured (Type 21) Tobacco 



The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated to have
been consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993-94 MY is approximately 1.5 million pounds.
The average annual quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United
States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993-94 MY was 2.7 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic
use and exports have trended sharply downward. For that reason, a normal year's domestic consumption has been determined
to be 0.5 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 2.1 million pounds. Application of the
formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 5.61 million pounds.


Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 4.4 million
pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (type 21) tobacco crop is estimated to be 1.9 million pounds. Therefore, the total supply
of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 6.3 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance
will total approximately 2.5 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover
of 3.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained. 

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 1.81 million pounds.
This represents the quantity of fire-cured (type 21) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during
such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Less than 85 percent of the announced national marketing quota is
expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 2.15 million pounds
is necessary to make available production of 1.81 million pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for
the 1994 MY is 2.15 million pounds. In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing
quota of 2.15 million pounds by the 1989-93, 5-year national average yield of 1,388 pounds per acre results in
a 1994 national acreage allotment of 1,548.99 acres. 

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing
the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 5.0 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments (previous year's allotments). The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors
specified in section 313(g) of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve,
to old farms. 



(2) Fire-Cured (Types 22-23) Tobacco 



The yearly average quantity of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated
to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY was approximately 17.8 million
pounds. The average annual quantity of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco produced in the United States and exported
during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was 16.9 million pounds (farm sales weight basis). Both domestic use and exports
have trended upward recently. A normal year's domestic consumption has for that reason been determined to be 21.8
million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 20.7 million pounds. Application of the formula
prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 98.8 million pounds. 

Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 64.0
million pounds. The 1993 fire-cured (types 22-23) crop is estimated to be 36.8 million pounds. Therefore, the
total supply of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco for the MY beginning October 1, 1993, is 100.8 million pounds.
During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 34.0 million pounds. By deducting
this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 66.8 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.


The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 32.0 million pounds.
This represents the quantity of fire-cured (types 22-23) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available
during the 1994 MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. About 95 percent of the announced national marketing
quota is expected to be produced.

Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 33.7 million pounds is necessary
to make available production of 32.0 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act, it has been
further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction
of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 40.4 million pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 40.4 million pounds
by the 1989-93, 5-year national average yield of 2,275 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment
of 17,758.24 acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing
the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 40 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.



(3) Dark Air-Cured (Types 35-36) Tobacco



The yearly average quantity of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco produced in the United States, which is
estimated to have been consumed in the United States, during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993-94 MY was approximately
10.6 million pounds. The average annual quantity of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco produced in the United
States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993 MY was 1.9 million pounds (farm sales
weight basis). Both domestic use and exports have trended downward. Accordingly, a normal year's domestic consumption
has been determined to be 10.0 million pounds and a normal year's exports have been determined to be 1.6 million pounds.
Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of
31.6 million pounds.

Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco held on October 1, 1993,
of 24.2 million pounds. The 1993 dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco crop is estimated to be 9.9 million pounds.
Therefore, the total supply of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 34.1 million pounds. During
the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total approximately 10.0 million pounds. By deducting this disappearance
from the total supply, a carryover of 24.1 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 7.5 million pounds.
This represents the quantity of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco which may be marketed which will make available
during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level.

More than 80 percent of the announced national marketing quota is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been
determined that a national marketing quota of 8.8 million pounds is necessary to make available production of 7.5
million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act, it has been further determined that the 1994 national
marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid undue restriction of marketings. This results in
a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 10.6 million pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 10.6 million pounds
by the 1989-93, 5-year average yield of 2,105 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of
5,035.63 acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 0.95 is determined by dividing
the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 28.0 acres, by the total of 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.

(4) Virginia Sun-Cured (Type 37) Tobacco



The yearly average quantity of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco produced in the United States which is estimated
to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 MYs preceding the 1993-94 MY was approximately 220,000
pounds. The average annual quantity produced in the United States and exported during the same period was approximately
120,000 pounds (farm sales weight basis). Domestic use has shown a sharp downward trend, and exports have shown a moderate
downward trend. Accordingly, a quantity of 92,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's domestic consumption
and a quantity of 20,000 pounds has been determined to be a normal year's exports. Application of the formula prescribed
by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act results in a reserve supply level of 300,000 pounds.

Manufacturers and dealers reported stocks of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco held on October 1, 1993, of 200,000
pounds. The 1993 Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco crop is estimated to be 100,000 pounds. Therefore, the total
supply of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco for the 1993 MY is 300,000 pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated
that disappearance will total approximately 120,000 pounds. By deducting this disappearance from the total supply,
a carryover of 180,000 pounds at the beginning of the 1994 MY is obtained.

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 120,000 pounds.
This represents the quantity of Virginia sun-cured (type 37) tobacco which may be marketed that will make available
during such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Around 90 percent of the announced national marketing quota
is expected to be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds
is necessary to make available production of 120,000 pounds. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for the 1994
MY is 131,000 pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 131,000 pounds by
the 1989-93, 5-year national yield of 1,286 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment of 101.87
acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, a national acreage factor of 1.05 is determined by dividing
the national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 0.08 acre, by the total of the 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.



(5) Cigar-Filler and Binder (Types 42-44 and 53-55) Tobacco



The yearly average quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) tobacco produced in the
United States which is estimated to have been consumed in the United States during the 10 years preceding the 1993 MY
was approximately 16.0 million pounds. The average annual quantity of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44
and 53-55) tobacco produced in the United States and exported from the United States during the 10 MYs preceding
the 1993 MY was less than 100,000 pounds. Domestic use has trended downward and exports are almost nonexistent. Accordingly,
a normal year's domestic consumption has been established at 12.0 million pounds while a normal year's export has
been established at 60,000 pounds. Application of the formula prescribed by section 301(b)(14)(B) of the 1938 Act
results in a reserve supply level of 34.8 million pounds.

Manufacturers and dealers report stocks of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) tobacco held
on October 1, 1993, of 30.8 million pounds. The 1993 cigar-filler and binder crop is estimated to be 7.7 million pounds.
Therefore, the total supply of cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44 and 53-55) tobacco for the 1993 MY
is 38.5 million pounds. During the 1993 MY, it is estimated that disappearance will total about 9.0 million pounds.
By deducting this disappearance from the total supply, a carryover of 29.5 million pounds at the beginning of the 1994
MY is obtained.

The difference between the reserve supply level and the estimated carryover on October 1, 1994, is 5.3 million pounds.
This represents the quantity of cigar-filler and binder tobacco which may be marketed that will make available during
such MY a supply equal to the reserve supply level. Slightly less than 70 percent of the announced national marketing
quota may be produced. Accordingly, it has been determined that a 1994 national marketing quota of 7.75 million pounds
is necessary to make available production of 5.3 million pounds. In accordance with section 312(b) of the 1938 Act,
it has been further determined that the 1994 national marketing quota must be increased by 20 percent in order to avoid
undue restriction of marketings. This results in a national marketing quota for the 1994 MY of 9.3 million pounds.

In accordance with section 313(g) of the 1938 Act, dividing the 1994 national marketing quota of 9.3 million pounds
by the 1989-93, 5-year national average yield of 1,879 pounds per acre results in a 1994 national acreage allotment
of 4,949.44 acres.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 313(g), of the 1938 Act, a national factor of 0.70 is determined by dividing the
national acreage allotment for the 1994 MY, less a national reserve of 4 acres, by the total of the 1994 preliminary
farm acreage allotments. The preliminary farm acreage allotments reflect the factors specified in section 313(g)
of the 1938 Act for apportioning the national acreage allotment, less the national reserve, to old farms.



(6) Cigar-Filler (Type 46) Tobacco



There is no demand for cigar-filler (type 46) tobacco. Accordingly, the reserve supply level is zero. The estimated
carryover at the start of MY 1994 is 0.6 million pounds.

Because the estimated carryover exceeds the reserve supply level, the quantity of tobacco which may be marketed during
MY 1994 and the 1994 acreage allotment are both zero.



(7) Referendum Results for Fire-Cured (Types 21-23) and Dark Air-Cured (Types 35-36) Tobaccos



Marketing quotas shall be in effect for the 1994 MY for fire-cured (types 21-23) and dark air-cured (types 35-36)
tobaccos. In referenda held March 28-31, 1994, 89.8 percent of producers of fire-cured (types 21-23)
tobacco and 90.0 percent of producers of dark air-cured (types 35-36) tobacco voted in favor of marketing quotas.

The following is a summary of the results of the separate referenda:

Price Support 


Section 106(f)(6)(A) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support for the 1994 crop of a kind of tobacco (other
than flue-cured and burley) shall be the level in cents per pound at which the 1993 crop of such kind of tobacco was supported,
plus or minus, respectively, the amount by which (i) the support level for the 1994 crop, as determined under section
106(b) of the 1949 Act, is greater or less than (ii) the support level for the 1993 crop, as determined under section
106(d) of the 1949 Act if the support level under clause (i) is greater than the support level under clause (ii). 
Accordingly, the support level for the 1994 crop of such kind of tobacco will be the 1993 level, adjusted by the difference
(plus or minus) between the 1993 ``basic support level'' and the 1994 ``basic support level.'' 
In addition, section 106(f)(6)(B) of the 1949 Act provides that to the extent requested by the board of directors of
an association, through which price support is made available to producers (producer association), the Secretary
may reduce the support level determined under section 106(f)(6)(A) of the 1949 Act for the respective kind of tobacco
to more accurately reflect the market value and improve the marketability of such tobacco. Accordingly, the price
support level for a kind of tobacco set forth in this rule could be reduced if such a request is made. 



Determinations 


The following levels of price support for the 1993 crops of various kinds of tobacco were determined in accordance
with section 106(f)(6)(A) of the 1949 Act: 





Section 106(b) of the 1949 Act provides that the ``basic support level'' for any year is determined by multiplying
the support level for the 1959 crop of such kind of tobacco by the ratio of the average of the index of prices paid by farmers,
including wage rates, interest, and taxes (referred to as the ``parity index'') for the three previous calendar years
to the average index of such prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, and taxes for the 1959 calendar
year. For the 1994 crop year: 
(1) Average parity indexes for calendar years 1990-1993 are as follows. 





(2) Average parity index, calendar year 1959=298. 
(3) 1993 ratio of 1,287 to 298=4.32; 1994 ratio of 1,287 to 298=4.39. 
(4) Ratios times 1959 support levels and 1994 increase in basic support levels are as follows:

Section 106(d) of the 1949 Act provides that the Secretary of Agriculture may reduce the level of support which would
otherwise be established for any grade of such kind of tobacco which the Secretary determines will likely be in excess
supply. In addition, the weighted average of the level of support for all eligible grades of such tobacco must, after
such reduction, reflect not less than 65 percent of the increase in the support level for such kind of tobacco which
would otherwise be established under section 106 of the Act if the support level is higher than the support level for
the preceding crop. Before any such reduction is made, the Secretary must consult with the associations handling
price support loans and consideration must be given to the supply and anticipated demand of such tobacco, including
the effect of such reduction on other kinds of quota tobacco. In determining whether the supply of any grade of any kind
of tobacco of a crop will be excessive, the Secretary shall take into consideration the domestic supply, including
domestic inventories, the amount of such tobacco pledged as security for price support loans, anticipated domestic
and export demand, based on the maturity, uniformity, and stalk position of such tobacco. 

For MY 1994, the flue-cured support level was increased by 65 percent of the formula increase to within about 9 percent
of 1993's average market price. For the kinds of tobacco that are the subject of this rule, MY 1993 prices were further
above the support level, and overall loan receipts remained low. Only loan placements for cigar-filler and binder
(types 42-44 and 53-55) were as much as 10 percent of production for MY 1993. Although fire-cured (type
21) and Virginia sun-cured (type 37) supply-use ratios suggest slightly short supplies, their respective loan associations
prefer lower price support levels. Therefore, for fire-cured tobacco (type 21), Virginia sun-cured tobacco (type
37), and cigar-filler and binder tobacco (types 42-44 and 53-55), the MY 1994 support levels consist of
the 1993 support levels increased by 65 percent of the difference between the 1994 ``basic support level'' and the
1993 ``basic 
support level.'' The supply-use ratios for Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured (types 22-23) and dark air-cured
(types 35-36) suggest adequate supplies. Accordingly, for these tobaccos, the MY 1994 support level consists
of the MY 1993 level of support increased by the difference between the MY 1994 ``basic support level'' and the MY 1993
``basic support level.'' Also, chewing tobacco, smoking tobacco, and snuff manufacturing formulas limit the substitutability
of one of these kinds of tobacco for another. Cigarettes, the principal outlet for flue-cured and burley tobaccos,
do not require any of these six kinds of tobacco in their blends. 

Accordingly, the following determinations announced by the Secretary of Agriculture on March 1, 1994, in accordance
with section 106(f)(8)(A) of the 1949 Act are established for MY 1994 for fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured (types
22-23), dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37), cigar-filler and binder (types
42-44 and 53-55), and cigar-filler (type 46) tobaccos.

Irish Potatoes Grown in Washington; Expenses and Assessment Rate



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an amended
interim final rule that authorized expenses and established an assessment rate that generated funds to pay those
expenses. Authorization of this budget enables the State of Washington Potato Committee (Committee) to incur expenses
that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments
on handlers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 113 and Order No. 946, both as amended (7 CFR part 946), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Washington. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the provisions of the marketing
order now in effect, Washington potatoes are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued
herein will be applicable to all assessable potatoes handled during the 1994-95 fiscal period, which begins
July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued hereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 450 producers of Washington potatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 35 handlers.
Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having
annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts
are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Washington potato producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.

The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the State of Washington Potato Committee,
the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Washington potatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Washington potatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that
will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.

The Committee met February 23, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $38,100, the same as the
previous year. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.005 per hundredweight, the same
as last season. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 7.5 million hundredweight, will yield $37,500
in assessment income. This, along with $600 from the Committee's authorized reserve will be adequate to cover budgeted
expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994-95 fiscal period, estimated at $51,953, will be within
the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses.

An increase in the 1994-95 budget of $700 for compliance audits, $200 for salary expense, $100 for audit expense,
and $500 for postage will be offset by a decrease of $1,000 in Committee expense and $500 in the miscellaneous category.
Major expense items include $4,000 for Committee member compensation for meeting attendance, $2,000 for surveillance
inspection, $1,800 for office supplies, $3,000 for postage, $1,500 for miscellaneous, $1,000 for audit, $2,400
for Washington Potato Commission contract fees, $11,200 for salaries, $1,800 for salary expense, and $5,200 for
compliance audits. The Commission provides certain services to the Committee as specified in a memorandum of understanding.
An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 31, 1994 (59 FR 15039). That interim final rule added  946.246 to authorize expenses and establish an
assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through May 2,
1994. No comments were received.
While this rule will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Southeastern Potatoes; Expenses and Assessment Rate


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 953
for the 1994-95 fiscal period. Authorization of this budget enables the Southeastern Potato Committee (Committee)
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are
derived from assessments on handlers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 104 and Order No. 953, both as amended (7 CFR part 953), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Southeastern States (Virginia and North Carolina). The marketing agreement
and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),
hereinafter referred to as the Act.


The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order now in effect, Virginia-North Carolina potato handlers are subject to assessments. It is intended that the
assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable potatoes during the 1994-95 fiscal period,
which begins June 1, 1994, and ends May 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 150 producers of Southeastern potatoes under this marketing order, and approximately 60
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Southeastern potato producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities.
 The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the Southeastern Potato Committee, the
agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval.
The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Southeastern potatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's
needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate
budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had
an opportunity to participate and provide input.
 The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Southeastern potatoes, based on last season's crop of approximately 1,335,000 hundredweight. Because that rate
will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the
Committee's expenses.
 
The Committee met April 20, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $11,000, the same as last year. Major
expense items include $6,800 for Committee staff salaries and $900 for travel expenses.
 

The Committee also recommended an assessment rate of $0.0075 per hundredweight, $0.0025 less than last season's
rate. Planting for the 1994-95 crop season has not been completed. However, the manager estimates shipments will
generate about $7,000 in assessment income. This, along with funds from the Committee's $15,000 reserve, will be
adequate to cover the expenses incurred. Funds remaining at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal period should be about the
maximum permitted by the order of approximately one fiscal period's expenses.
 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits
derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this
action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will
tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on June 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable Irish potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued
in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will
be considered prior to finalization of this action.

Irish Potatoes Grown in Colorado; Expenses and Assessment Rate 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate under Marketing Order No. 948
for the 1994-95 fiscal period. Authorization of this budget enables the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee,
Northern Colorado Office (Area III) (Committee) to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer
the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 97 and Marketing Order No. 948, both as amended (7 CFR part 948), regulating
the handling of Irish potatoes grown in Colorado. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order now in effect, Colorado potatoes are subject to assessments. Funds to administer the Colorado potato marketing
order are derived from such assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable
to all assessable potatoes during the 1994-95 fiscal period, which begins July 1, 1994, and ends June 30, 1995.
This interim final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an
irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the
rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities
acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 85 producers of Colorado Area III potatoes under the marketing order and approximately 15
handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601)
as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of Colorado Area III potato producers and handlers may be classified
as small entities. 


The budget of expenses for the 1994-95 fiscal period was prepared by the Colorado Potato Administrative Committee,
Northern Colorado Office (Area III), the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and
submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Colorado Area
III potatoes. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods and services in their local
area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public
meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input. 


The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of Colorado Area III potatoes. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate
that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. 


In Colorado, both a State and a Federal marketing order operate simultaneously. The State order authorizes promotion,
including paid advertising, which the Federal order does not. All expenses in this category are financed under the
State order. The jointly operated programs consume about equal administrative time and the two orders continue to
split administrative costs equally. 


The Committee met on April 14, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994-95 budget of $24,325, $7,474 more than
the previous year. Increases in the Federal portion of the administrative budget include $200 for Committee meetings,
$450 for Committee mileage, $50 for insurance and bond, $2,860 for the manager's salary, $620 for medical insurance,
$1,750 for office equipment, $500 for office supplies, $219 for payroll taxes, $200 for telephone, $250 for miscellaneous,
$125 for manager's expense, and $250 for Federal meetings.

The major expense item is $11,500 for the manager's salary. The actual salary will be $10,781.50, based on nine months
full-time work and three months at three-quarter time. An additional $718.50 was budgeted to have available and will
only be spent if the workload necessitates full-time work. 

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.02 per hundredweight, the same as last season.
This rate, when applied to anticipated potato shipments of 1,476,750 hundredweight, will yield $29,535 in assessment
income, which is adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve at the beginning of the 1994-95 fiscal
period, estimated at $31,113, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. 

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the
benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted
by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal period begins on July 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal
period apply to all assessable potatoes handled during the fiscal period; (3) handlers are aware of this action which
was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this rule.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Reapportionment of Independent Handler Representation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule revises the administrative rules and regulations established under the Federal marketing
order for raisins produced from grapes grown in California. This rule reapportions the representation established
for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee),
to provide for more equitable representation. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee,
which is responsible for local administration of the order.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing
Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''



The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have any retroactive
effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 

This interim final rule reapportions the Committee representation established for independent and small cooperative
marketing association handlers on the Committee. This interim rule provides for broader independent handler/small
cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in the raisin industry.
The change will not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on handlers or producers.


This action revises Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations and is based on a unanimous
recommendation of the Committee and other available information. 

Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers,
10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member.
The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired
not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative
handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired
less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative
in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers
are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions
specified in paragraph (d) of  989.26. 

Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations currently provides for independent and small cooperative
handler representation on the Committee as follows: 

(1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired
the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; 

(2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association
handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;
and 

(3) The remaining member(s) selected from and representing all other handlers, including small cooperative marketing
association handler(s) and all processors. 

For the purposes of this interim final rule, category (1) is referred to as the ``large-sized handler'' group, category
(2) is referred to as the ``medium-sized handler'' group, and category (3) is referred to as the ``all other handler''
group. The number of handlers in the ``all other handler'' group has decreased from 10 to 7 since the 1990-91 crop
year. Also, during the 1992-93 crop year, the ``medium-sized handler'' group acquired more than four times
the tonnage acquired by the ``all other handler'' group. 

On the basis of this information, the Committee unanimously recommended on March 9, 1994, that one handler position
be moved from the ``all other handler'' group to the ``medium-sized handler'' group. The current and recommended
independent handler/small cooperative handler representation, are shown as follows: 






The shift in membership recognizes the relative importance of the ``large-sized handler,'' ``medium-sized handler,''
and ``all other handler groups,'' and will provide an opportunity for the ten largest independent/small cooperative
handlers to be represented on the Committee either as a member or as an alternate member. The ``all other handler''
group will be eligible to nominate two members and two alternate members. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this interim final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's unanimous recommendation
and other available information, it is found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that, upon good cause, it is impracticable, unnecessary,
and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good
cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The 1994-96 term of office begins May 1, 1994, and this action should be effective as soon as possible
so that these positions can be filled as close to May 1, 1994, as possible; (2) this action does not impose additional
regulatory requirements on handlers or producers and, therefore, neither handlers nor producers need additional
time to comply; (3) the industry is aware of this action, which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at an open
meeting; and (4) this rule provides a 30-day comment period and any comments received will be considered prior to finalization
of this rule.

Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Final Free and Reserve Percentages for the 1993-94 Crop Year
for Natural (Sun-Dried) Seedless Raisins 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule that established final free and reserve percentages for 1993 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins.
The percentages are 74 percent free and 26 percent reserve. These percentages help stabilize supplies and prices
and counter the destabilizing effects of the burdensome oversupply situation facing the raisin industry. This rule
was unanimously recommended by the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), which is responsible for local
administration of the marketing order.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under marketing agreement and Order No. 989 [7 CFR Part 989], both as amended, regulating
the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the ``order.'' The order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter
referred to as the ``Act.'' 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, final free and reserve percentages may be established for raisins acquired by handlers during the crop
year. This action finalizes final free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins for the
1993-94 crop year, beginning August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any State
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempt therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his/her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing
order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined
by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers
and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities. 
An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 [59 FR 12528], with an effective date of March 17, 1994. That rule established final free and reserve
percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins for the 1993-94 crop year. The percentages were established
in a new section 989.246 of the rules and regulations in effect under the marketing order. That rule provided a 30-day
comment period which ended April 18, 1994. No comments were received. 
The order prescribes procedures for computing trade demands and preliminary and final percentages that establish
the amount of raisins that can be marketed throughout the season. The regulations apply to all handlers of California
raisins. Raisins in the free percentage category may be shipped immediately to any market, while reserve raisins
must be held by handlers in a reserve pool for the account of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration
of the order. Under the order, reserve raisins may be: Sold at a later date by the Committee to handlers for free use;
used in diversion programs; exported to authorized countries; carried over as a hedge against a short crop the following
year; or disposed of in other outlets noncompetitive with those for free tonnage raisins. While this rule may restrict
the amount of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins that enter domestic markets, final free and reserve percentages
are intended to lessen the impact of the oversupply situation facing the industry and promote stronger marketing
conditions, thus stabilizing prices and supplies and improving grower returns. In addition to the quantity of raisins
released under the preliminary percentages and the final percentages, the order specifies methods to make available
additional raisins to handlers by requiring sales of reserve pool raisins for use as free tonnage raisins under ``10
plus 10'' offers, and authorizing sales of reserve raisins under certain conditions.

The Department's ``Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders'' specifies that 110 percent
of recent years' sales should be made available to primary markets each season before recommendations for volume
regulation are approved. This goal is met by the establishment of a final percentage which releases 
100 percent of the computed trade demand and the additional release of reserve raisins to handlers under ``10 plus
10'' offers. The ``10 plus 10'' offers are two simultaneous offers of reserve pool raisins which are made available
to handlers each season. For each such offer, a quantity of raisins equal to 10 percent of the prior year's shipments
is made available for free use. 
Pursuant to  989.54(a) of the order, the Committee which is responsible for local administration of the order,
met on August 16, 1993, to review shipment and inventory data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins
of all varietal types. The Committee computed a trade demand for each varietal type for which a free tonnage percentage
might be recommended. The trade demand is 90 percent of the prior year's shipments of free tonnage and reserve tonnage
raisins sold for free use for each varietal type into all market outlets, adjusted by subtracting the carryin of each
varietal type on August 1 of the current crop year and by adding to the trade demand the desirable carryout for each varietal
type at the end of that crop year. As specified in  989.154, the desirable carryout for each varietal type shall
be equal to the shipments of free tonnage raisins of the prior crop year during the months of August, September, and
one half of October. If the prior year's shipments are limited because of crop conditions, the total shipments during
that period of time during one of the three years preceding the prior crop year may be used. In accordance with these
provisions, the Committee computed and announced a 1993-94 trade demand of 282,909 tons for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins. 
As required under section 989.54(b) of the order, the Committee met on October 5, 1993, and computed and announced
a preliminary crop estimate and preliminary free and reserve percentages for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins
which released 85 percent of the trade demand since field prices had been established. The preliminary crop estimate
and preliminary free and reserve percentages were as follows: 387,947 tons, and 62 percent free and 38 percent reserve.
Also at that meeting, the Committee computed and announced preliminary crop estimates and preliminary free and reserve
percentages for Dipped Seedless, Oleate and Related Seedless, Golden Seedless, Zante Currant, Sultana, Muscat,
Monukka, and Other Seedless raisins. On November 15, 1993, the Committee decided that volume control percentages
only were warranted for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins, which would remain at 62 percent free and 38 percent
reserve. It determined that the supplies of the other varietal types would be less than or close enough to the computed
trade demands for each of these varietals or could be substituted to relieve anticipated shortages in some size ranges
of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins used for baking. In view of these factors, volume control percentages would
not be necessary to maintain market stability. 
Pursuant to  989.54(c), the Committee may adopt interim free and reserve percentages. Interim percentages
may release less than the computed trade demand for each varietal type. Interim percentages for Natural (sun-dried)
Seedless raisins of 73.75 percent free and 26.25 percent reserve were computed and announced on January 13, 1994.
That action released most, but not all, of the computed trade demand for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins. 
Under  989.54(d) of the order, the Committee is required to recommend to the Secretary, no later than February
15 of each crop year, final free and reserve percentages which, when applied to the final production estimate of a varietal
type, will tend to release the full trade demand for any varietal type.

The Committee's final estimate of 1993-94 production of Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins is 384,501 tons.
Dividing the computed trade demand of 282,909 tons by the final estimate of production results in a final free percentage
of 74 percent and a final reserve percentage of 26 percent. 
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the issuance of this final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all relevant information presented, including the Committee's recommendations and other
information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 [59 FR 12528], will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Immigrant Petitions; Religious Workers



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interim rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by providing that all
persons, other than ministers, immigrating to the United States as religious workers, must immigrate or adjust status
to permanent residence before October 1, 1994. This interim rule implements section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (Act) which provides that religious workers who have two years of membership and experience in
a religious occupation or vocation qualify as special immigrant religious workers. By statute, this immigrant category
for religious workers expires on October 1, 1994. This rule codifies, in regulatory form, the October 1, 1994, statutory
deadline.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 151(a) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101-649, November 29, 1990, created a new
special immigrant category for religious workers and ministers by amending section 101(a)(27)(C) of the Act. In
order to qualify as a minister, the applicant must be an ordained minister of a religious denomination and have carried
on the vocation of minister during the two years immediately preceding the application for admission. Section 101(a)(27)(C)
also provides for special immigrant status for persons, other than ministers, who will work in a religious occupation
or vocation for a religious organization in a professional or other capacity. Such religious workers must have carried
on the religious occupation or vocation during the two-year period immediately preceding the petition for special
immigrant status. See section 101(a)(27)(C)(i)(I) of the Act.



Unlike the provision for ministers, which does not contain a sunset provision, section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) (II) and
(III) of the Act states that the other two types of religious workers must ``seek to enter the United States before October
1, 1994.'' By requiring special immigrant religious workers (with the exception of ministers) to enter the United
States before October 1, 1994, Congress clearly intended that this immigrant category terminate or ``sunset'' on
that date. The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a petition be filed with the Service to establish the
alien's eligibility for special immigrant status as a religious worker. See section 204(a)(1)(E)(i) of the Act.
The next step in the immigration process is for the alien to enter the United States as a permanent resident or adjust
status to permanent residence under the religious worker category. By requiring special immigrant religious workers
to immigrate before October 1, 1994, Congress mandated that the entire immigration process for these persons must
be completed before October 1, 1994. In other words, in order to immigrate under the special immigrant religious worker
category, aliens who are not ministers must have a petition approved on their behalf and either enter the United States
as an immigrant or adjust their status to permanent residence before October 1, 1994. On or after October 1, 1994, the
Service will lack the statutory authority to accord permanent resident status to a religious worker. The Department
of State regulations already provide that an immigrant visa issued to a special immigrant religious worker shall
be valid no later than September 30, 1994. See 22 CFR 42.32(d)(1)(ii). This interim rule is consistent with both the
statute and the Department of State regulation.

8 CFR 204.5(m)(1) currently states that petitions for professional religious workers and other religious workers
must be filed on or before September 30, 1994. For the sake of clarification, 8 CFR 204.5(m)(1) will be amended to provide
specifically that aliens must obtain permanent resident status through immigration or adjustment of status on or
before September 30, 1994, to qualify under the special immigrant religious worker category.

The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment,
is based on the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reason and necessity for immediate
implementation of this interim rule is as follows: Immediate promulgation of this interim rule is necessary to remove
any ambiguity regarding the September 30, 1994, sunset date well in advance of the statutory deadline, thereby reminding
qualified religious workers other than ministers and sponsoring religious organizations of the need to complete
the permanent residence process if they wish to immigrate pursuant to section 203(b)(4) of the Act.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule merely clarifies a statutory deadline for a limited
number of aliens to become special immigrant religious workers.



Executive Order 12866



This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, Section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section (6)(a)(3)(A).



Executive Order 12612



The regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government
and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Executive Order 12606



The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has addressed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that it will have no effect on family well-being.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 767 Series Airplanes 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Boeing Model 767 series airplanes.
This action requires repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain midspar
fuse pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. This amendment is prompted by reports
of longitudinal fatigue cracks on certain midspar fuse pins installed on Boeing Model 767 series airplanes. The actions
specified in this AD are intended to prevent loss of the strut and engine due to cracking of both fuse pins on the same
strut. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FAA has received several reports of longitudinal fatigue cracks on certain midspar fuse pins installed on Boeing
Model 767 series airplanes. A total of five cracked fuse pins have been found on two airplanes that had accumulated
between 15,628 and 23,056 total landings. Cracks were found on both midspar fuse pins of the same strut on one of these
airplanes. A possible cause of this cracking is ovalization of the fuse pin due to stress. Results of testing of fuse
pins having a design similar to those that cracked have revealed no significant reduction in shear strength with longitudinal
cracks up to one inch in length. Cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut, if not corrected, could result in loss of
the strut and engine. 


All reported cracks have occurred on midspar fuse pins having part number 311T3102-1. Midspar fuse pins having
part numbers 311T3102-2 and 311T2102-1 are similar in design to the fuse pins on which cracking was found
and, therefore, also are subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767-54A0062, dated April 14, 1994, that describes
procedures for repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect cracks of certain midspar fuse
pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. Accomplishment of these inspections will
provide early detection of cracks in the midspar fuse pins of both struts.
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model 767 series airplanes
of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent cracking of both fuse pins on the same strut, which could result
in loss of the strut and engine. This AD requires repetitive detailed visual and eddy current inspections to detect
cracks of certain midspar fuse pins, and replacement of any cracked midspar fuse pin with a new fuse pin. The actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the
FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped
postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-60-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Adoption of the Amendment


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.


 39.13

[Amended]


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 





94-11-02 Boeing: 

Amendment 39-8918 Docket 94-NM-60-AD.





Applicability: 

All Model 767 series airplanes, certificated in any category.


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.

Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125 and Hawker 800 and 1000 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model
DH/BH/HS BAe 125 and Hawker 800 and 1000 series airplanes. This action requires a visual inspection to determine whether
adequate clearance exists between the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment, and adjustments, if necessary;
and a visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris
into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by reports
of smoke emanating from the lavatory due to overheating of the fan venturi motor. The actions specified in this AD are
intended to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model DH/BH/HS/BAe 125 and Hawker 800
and 1000 series airplanes. The CAA advises it has received reports of smoke emanating from the lavatory in the rear
of the cabin while several airplanes were being prepared for departure. Investigation revealed that the venturi
fan motor overheated due to insufficient clearance between the motor and the adjacent sound insulation and wiring.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane is in flight.



Raytheon Corporate Jets, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin SB 21-A150, dated February 22, 1994, that
describes procedures for a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between the
fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms) and
adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This alert service bulletin also describes
procedures for a one-time visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials,
and ingestion of debris into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The CAA classified
this alert service bulletin as mandatory and issued a British airworthiness directive in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

These airplane models are manufactured in the United Kingdom and are type certificated for operation in the United
States under the provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA
informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent smoke or fire in the cabin while the airplane
is in flight. This AD requires a one-time visual inspection to determine whether adequate clearance exists between
the fan venturi motor casing and the adjacent equipment (including insulating materials, ducting, and wire looms)
and adjustment of the insulating materials, ducting, and/or looms, if necessary. This AD also requires a one-time
visual inspection to detect signs of overheating, degradation of insulating materials, and ingestion of debris
into the motor, and replacement of discrepant parts with serviceable parts. The actions are required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-69-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is authorizing option contracts on the Long-Term Japanese
Government Bond futures contract traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited (SIMEX) to be
offered or sold to persons located in the United States. This Order is issued pursuant to: 


(1) Commission rule 30.3(a), 17 CFR 30.3(a) (1993), which makes it unlawful for any person to engage in the offer or
sale of a foreign option product until the Commission, by order, authorizes such foreign option to be offered or sold
in the United States; and 
(2) The Commission's Order issued on July 20, 1988, 53 FR 28826 (July 29, 1988), authorizing certain option products
traded on SIMEX to be offered or sold in the United States.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Commission has issued the following Order:

Contract Traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited To Be Offered or Sold in the United States
Thirty Days After Publication of This Notice in the 

Federal Register

 




By Order issued on July 20, 1988 (Initial Order), the Commission authorized, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a),

1

 certain option products traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Limited (SIMEX) to be offered or
sold in the United States. 53 FR 28826 (July 29, 1988). Among other conditions, the Initial Order specified that:

previously discussed in the Initial Order, the Commission believes that the request for authorization to offer or
sell option contracts on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract

3

 should be granted. 






Accordingly, pursuant to Commission rule 30.3(a) and the Commission's Initial Order issued on July 20, 1988, and
subject to the terms and conditions specified therein, the Commission hereby authorizes SIMEX's option contracts
on the Long-Term Japanese Government Bond futures contract to be offered or sold to persons located in the United States

Contract Specifications, Options on Long-Term Japanese Government Bond Futures 



Underlying Interest 



One (1) Long-Term Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Futures contract representing 50,000,000 face value notional
long term 10-year JGB with 6% coupon. 



Description 



A buyer of one option on long term JGB Futures may exercise the option to assume a position in one long term JGB Futures
contract (long position if the option is a call and short position if the option is a put) of a specified contract month
at a specified strike price. 

The seller of one option on long term JGB Futures has the obligation of assuming, if the option is exercised by the buyer,
a position in one long term JGB Futures contract (short position if the option is a call and long position if the option
is a put) of a specified contract month at a specified strike price. 



Price Quotation 



Quoted in multiples of one hundredth (1/100) points. Each one hundredth point per 100 points represents 
051Y 5,000.
For example, a quote of 0.46 represents a total option premium of 
051Y 230,000 (i.e., 46 basis points  x  
051Y 5,000).




Minimum Price Increment (Tick Size and Value) 



0.01 point (also known as one tick) = 
051Y 5,000 per contract (same as for underlying futures). 


Strike Prices 



Strike prices are set at maximum 0.50 point intervals. Sixteen (16) strike prices, eight above and eight below the
previous day's settlement price for the underlying JGB futures contract (for example, if a specific JGB futures settlement
price is 100.80, option strike prices may be set at 97.00, 97.50, 98.00, 98.50, 99.00, 99.50, 100.00, 100.50, 101.00,
101.50, 102.00, 102.50, 103.00, 103.50, 104.00 and 104.50), will be available from the first day of trading. Thereafter,
the Exchange shall, if necessary, list additional options at such new exercise prices as may be necessary to ensure
that the next eight exercise prices above and below the previous day's settlement price are listed for trading. 



Contract Months 


Options available on the two nearest serial months and two nearest quarterly months chosen from March, June, September
and December. For example, on 21 April 1994, the available contract months will be May, June, July and September. 



Trading Hours 


7:45 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. 
11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 


Trading Hours on the Last Trading Day 


7:45 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. 
11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. 



Last Trading Day 



Options trading shall terminate on the last Tokyo Stock Exchange business day of the month preceding the contract
month. 



Exercise 



American style, i.e., buyers of futures options may exercise their options on any business day up to and including
the expiration date (prior to the daily cut-off time). The Clearing House assigns exercise notices to sellers of options
according to a random selection process. In-the-money options are automatically exercised by the Clearing House
at expiry (unless otherwise instructed). The settlement price of the Tokyo Stock Exchange long term JGB futures contract
having the same contract month as the underlying SIMEX JGB futures contract will be used as a reference to determine
which options may be exercised automatically at expiry. 


Expiration 


The last trading day. 


Minimum Margin Requirements 


The minimum margin is subject to periodic changes. 


Buyers of Options 


 Premium must be paid in full when the option is bought.

Kentucky Regulatory Program Amendment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the approval, with an exception, of a proposed program amendment to the Kentucky regulatory program
(hereinafter referred to as the Kentucky program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The amendment consists of proposed modifications to Kentucky Administrative Regulations (KAR) relating to surface
and underground coal mining permits, and fish and wildlife resources, and replaces two earlier proposed program
amendments submitted on June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record No. KY-1059), and March 13, 1992 (Administrative
Record No. KY-1119).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background on the Kentucky Program.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment.

III. Director's Findings.

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments.

V. Director's Decision.

VI. Procedural Determinations.



I. Background on the Kentucky Program



On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kentucky program. Background information
on the Kentucky program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of
approval can be found in May 18, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 21404-21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can
be found at 30 CFR 917.11, 917.13, 917.15, 917.16 and 917.17.



II. Submission of the Proposed Amendments



By letter of July 21, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KY-1167), Kentucky resubmitted a proposed program amendment
that completed the Kentucky promulgation process under the Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) Chapter 13A. This proposed
amendment replaces two earlier proposed program amendments dated March 13, 1992 (Administrative Record No. KY-1119),
and June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record No. KY-1059).

The July 21, 1992, resubmission contains revisions to 405 KAR 8:030 (Surface coal mining permits), 405 KAR 8:040 (Underground
coal mining permits), and 405 KAR 16:180/18:180 (Protection of fish, wildlife, and related environmental values).
The proposed revisions pertaining to fish and wildlife resources as set forth at 405 KAR 8:030 and 8:040 sections 20
and 36, and 405 KAR 16:180 and 18:180 sections 1, 2, and 3, were previously considered by OSM, and the Director's decision
on those provisions are discussed in the final rule dated December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58139-58144). However, OSM
inadvertently failed to finalize the portion of the amendment dealing with non-fish and wildlife resource revisions
to 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 contained in Kentucky's submissions dated June 28, 1991, March 13, 1992, and July 21, 1992.

In order to insure that appropriate opportunity for comment on the revisions has been provided, OSM reopened the public
comment period in the October 27, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57767), and in the same notice, provided opportunity for a public hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendments
to 405 KAR 8:030/8:040, other than the revisions to fish and wildlife resources.



III. Director's Findings



Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 ad 732.17 are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendments.

Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive wording changes, or revised cross-references
and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting from this amendment.

Kentucky proposes to delete 8:030 section 1(4) (a) and (b), and 8:040 section 1(3) (a) and (b), which contain a listing
of the required permit application forms and the location at which they may be obtained. Since the information contained
in these subsections is generally duplicative of information currently set forth at 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c)
and (d), the Director finds that the proposed deletions will not render the State's program less effective than the
Federal regulations.



2. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 2



Kentudky proposes to revise subsections (3), (4) and (5)(a) (405 KAR 8:030 only) by deleting cross-references to
405 KAR 7:020 dealing with the definitions of terms. Inasmuch as the Director previously approved the deletion of
405 KAR 7:020 and the relocation of the definition of terms regulations to the specific regulation chapters in which
terms are used (57 FR 45295, October 1, 1992), the Director finds that the deletion of these cross-references will
not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.

Kentucky proposes to delete Subsection (6), which requires a statement identifying any pending permit applications,
as well as any current or previous coal mining permits held during the preceding five years by the permit applicant
or of an owner/controller of the applicant. Section 507(b)(3) requires that the permit applicant identify any permits
held or previously held by the applicant and any pending permit applications. The Director agrees with the commenter
who asserted that SMCRA requires that this information be supplied by the permit applicant. The Director acknowledges
that the information concerning pending applications is requested in Kentucky's permit application. A question
in a permit application, by itself without an accompanying regulation, does not satisfy the statutory requirement
of 507(b)(3) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of section 2(6) would render that portion of
the Kentucky program less stringent than 507(b)(3) of SMCRA and cannot approve the deletion of this requirement.

Kentucky proposes to add subsection (11) which requires the permittee to notify the State immediately of any changes
in the permittee's address, if changed at any point prior to final bond release. Kentucky also proposes to add a new
subsection (12) which: (1) Requires the permittee to submit updates of certain information within thirty days of
the effective date of any such changes, (2) discusses the effect of failure to provide the updates, and (3) provides
for suspension of the permit, after opportunity for hearing, for failure to provide updated information upon request.
While there are no direct Federal counterparts for these provisions, the Director finds that the proposed revisions
will assist Kentucky in having the most current information on the applicant and will not render Kentucky's program
inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.

Finally, Kentucky proposes to delete former subsection (12) which required the applicant to submit required information
on appropriate forms which were incorporated by reference in section 1(4) which also has been deleted. These forms
are now among those forms listed at 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c) and (d). Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion
of subsection (12) will not render the State's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal
regulations. 

The Director notes that on September 23, 1991, he found subsection (12) to be less effective than 30 CFR 778.13(j) to
the extent that subsection (12) did not require the use of a format prescribed by OSM for the submission of information
required under 30 CFR 778.13 and 778.14 (56 FR 47907, September 23, 1991). Consistent with the Director's findings,
he required Kentucky, at 30 CFR 917.16(f), to amend its program. Since that 1991 finding, the Director has approved
405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1)(c). See 58 FR 3833, January 12, 1993. As stated above, 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1)(c) includes
the forms of former subsection (12). Therefore, the Director is amending his required amendment found at 30 CFR 917.16(f)
to delete any reference to subsection (12) and replacing that reference with 405 KAR 8:010 section 5(1) (c) and (d).



3. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 3



Kentucky proposes to revise subsection (5) by deleting a cross-reference to the definition of ``small operator''
in KRS 350.450(4)(d). Since this cross-reference is duplicative of the one contained in 405 KAR 8:001 (106), the Director
finds that the proposed deletion will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA
or the Federal regulations.



4. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 4



Kentucky proposes to revise subsection (2) regarding the information required to be submitted with the permit application
if the private mineral estate to be mined has been severed from the private surface estate. As revised, subsection
(2) is substantively identical to the Federal rule set forth at 30 CFR 778.15(b). Therefore, the Director finds that
the proposal is no less effective than the Federal counterpart.

5. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 5



Kentucky proposes to add a new subsection (4) which states that the requirements of 405 KAR 24:040 section 2(6) must
be met if the applicant proposes to conduct surface mining activities within 100 feet of a public road. The proposal
is substantively identical to that portion of the Federal rule concerning public roads as set forth at 30 CFR 778.16(c).
Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than its Federal counterpart.



6. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 10



Kentucky proposes to revise section 10 to clarify that the rule pertains to applications for a permit, major revision,
amendment, transfer, or renewal of a permit, and to require that any proof of publication which is filed must be acceptable
to the cabinet. The revision to section 10 is substantively identical to the Federal rule set forth at 30 CFR 778.21
except that the Federal rule doesn't require proof of publication for permit transfers. There is no Federal counterpart
for proof of publication of a permit transfer, but this is consistent with 30 CFR 774.17 which requires advertisement
of the transfer. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than its Federal counterparts.



7. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 37



Kentucky proposes to revise the information required in the postmining land use mining and reclamation plan, to include
a discussion of how the proposed postmining land use is to be achieved, including management practices to be conducted
during the liability period for the commercial forestland, cropland (including hayland), and pastureland land
uses. There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the proposal is consistent with 30 CFR 780.23(a)(2).

Additionally, Kentucky proposes to delete former subsection (1)(d) which required that the reclamation plan include
detailed management practices when the postmining land use was grazing. Pursuant to 405 KAR 16:210, grazing is not
one of the approved land uses in Kentucky. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this subsection does
not render the State's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations and is approving
the deletion.



8. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 38



Kentucky proposes to delete section 38 which deals with the mining and reclamation plan for transportation of coal
on public roads. This deletion was appropriate since Kentucky had deleted the statutory authority for this regulation.
On August 10, 1990, OSM approved (55 FR 32619) the deletion of this statutory authority, which was previously found
at KRS 350.060(11). In addition, there is no corresponding requirement in either SMCRA or the Federal rule. The Director
finds that the proposed deletion will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The public comment periods and opportunities to request a public hearing were announced as follows: (1) For the submission
dated June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record Number KY-1059), in the July 22, 1991, 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 33398); (2) For the submission dated March 13, 1992 (Administrative Record Number KY-1119), in the April
23, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 14818); (3) For the submission dated July 21, 1992 (Administrative Record Number KY-1167), in the September
23, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 43946); and (4) The proposed revisions were reopened for public comment in the October 27, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 57767). The public comment periods closed on August 21, 1991, May 8, 1992, October 8, 1992, and November 26, 1993,
respectively. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearings so no hearings were held.

The Kentucky Resources Council (KRC) filed comments regarding Kentucky's proposed deletion of 405 KAR 8:030/8:040
sections 2(6) and 38. In regard to the deletion of section 2(6), the Director has considered the concerns raised by
KRC as discussed in Finding III.2. herein, and determined that the proposed deletion would render Kentucky's program
less effective than the Federal program.

With regard to the proposed deletion of section 38, KRC questioned the wisdom of the deletion since KRC felt that information
required by section 38 ``provided an important source of information linking numerous contract mines to the companies
who controlled the extraction and the processing of the coal.'' KRC stated that ``[T]he maps have provided information
that has resulted in the imposition of reclamation liability on companies that owned or controlled the contract mines,
based on linkages that might otherwise not have been possible to support absent such information.'' In addition to
the reasons discussed in the Director's Findings, there are no comparable requirements in the Federal regulations
for the submission of such information. OSM cannot require states to enforce provisions for which there are no Federal
requirements. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed deletion. The Director notes that he found Kentucky's
ownership and/or control information requirements, with two exceptions, to be no less effective than the Federal
regulations. See 56 FR 47907, September 23, 1991).

On November 23, 1993, CONSOL, Inc. filed comments regarding the proposed addition of 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 section
2(12), expressing its concern regarding the proposed 30-day time limit for submitting updated ownership and control
information. CONSOL, Inc. recommended that the proposal be changed for large corporations, to allow for the submittal
of updated information within thirty days of the date when it is released by the corporate secretary rather than thirty
days from the effective date.

In responding to CONSOL's comments, the Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (Cabinet)
indicated that it understood the commenter's concern that the proposed language could be read to allow sanctions
to be imposed for failure to submit ownership and control updates within thirty days. The Cabinet went on the state
that it recognized that ``multi-level corporate entities require a reasonable amount of time in which to submit corporate
changes. The failure for an entity to submit updated information within the thirty (30) day timeframe does not automatically
constitute a violation. The Cabinet does not intend to initiate suspension procedures unless a permittee has refused
or failed to submit information to the Cabinet upon request.'' The proposed language in 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 section
2(12) provides that ``[A]fter the permittee's refusal or failure to timely submit the information to the cabinet
upon request, the Cabinet may suspend the permit after opportunity for hearing * * *.'' The Director
feels that Kentucky's response to the concerns raised by CONSOL, Inc. is adequate and he has approved the proposed
language herein.



Agency Comments



Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and the implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited
from various government agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kentucky program. The Kentucky Heritage
Council, Soil Conservation Service, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of Land Management, Maine Safety and Health
Administration, U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Mines generally considered the amendment to be acceptable
or submitted an acknowledgement with no comment.



Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence



Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

) or the Clean Water Act (22 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.



V. Director's Decision

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940526-0-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940526-0-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Based on the above findings, the Director is approving, with the exception discussed in Finding 2, the program amendment
submitted by Kentucky on June 28, 1991, and modified and resubmitted on March 13, 1992, and July 21, 1992, consisting
of revisions to various provisions of 405 KAR 8:030 and 8:040, other than fish and wildlife resources. In addition,
as discussed in Finding 2, the Director is continuing his required amendment.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 917 codifying decisions concerning the Kentucky program are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.



Effect of Director's Decision



Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to a State program are not enforceable until approved by
OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved programs. In the oversight
of the Kentucky program, the Director will recognize only the approved program, together with any consistent implementing
policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Kentucky of such provisions.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order No. 12866



This rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the review required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30
CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted
by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing
Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731 and 732 have been met.



National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

).



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS MERRILL (DD 976) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot comply fully
with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with its special functions as a naval destroyer. The
intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS MERRILL (DD 976) is a vessel of the Navy which, due to its special construction and purpose, cannot
comply fully with the following specific rule of 72 COLREGS: In that portion of Annex I, Section 3(a) pertaining to
the placement of the after masthead light and the horizontal distance between the forward and after masthead lights,
without interfering with its special functions as a naval vessel. The Judge Advocate General of the Navy has also certified
that the aforementioned lights are located in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements.



Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the placement of lights on this vessel in a manner differently from that prescribed herein
will adversely affect the vessel's ability to perform its military functions.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Navy is amending its certifications and exemptions under the International Regulations for
Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), to reflect that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy has determined
that USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC 9), USS FIREBOLT (PC 10), USS WHIRLWIND (PC 11), USS THUNDERBOLT
(PC 12), USS SHAMAL (PC 13) are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose, cannot comply
fully with certain provisions of the 72 COLREGS without interfering with their special functions as naval patrol
vessels. The intended effect of this rule is to warn mariners in waters where 72 COLREGS apply. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Pursuant to the authority granted in 33 U.S.C. 1605, the Department of the Navy amends 32 CFR part 706. This amendment
provides notice that the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Navy,
has certified that USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC 9), USS FIREBOLT (PC 10), USS WHIRLWIND (PC 11),
USS THUNDERBOLT (PC 12), USS SHAMAL (PC 13) are vessels of the Navy which, due to their special construction and purpose,
cannot comply fully with 72 COLREGS, Rule 23(a)(ii), pertaining to display of a masthead light and a second (after)
masthead light on vessels exceeding 50 meters in length; Annex I, paragraph 2(k), pertaining to the vertical distance
between the forward and after anchor lights and the height of the forward anchor light above the hull; Rule 21(c), pertaining
to location of the sternlight, without interfering with their special functions as naval patrol vessels. The Judge
Advocate General of the Navy has also certified that the number of masthead lights displayed and the location of the
other mentioned lights are in closest possible compliance with the applicable 72 COLREGS requirements. 


Moreover, it has been determined, in accordance with 32 CFR Parts 296 and 701, that publication of this amendment for
public comment prior to adoption is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to public interest since it is based
on technical findings that the number and placement of lights on USS SQUALL (PC 7), USS ZEPHYR (PC 8), USS CHINOOK (PC

Pacific Halibut Fisheries 



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement allocative regulations governing fishing for halibut in Regulatory Area
4B as recommended by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council). This action is necessary to enhance
the fishing opportunities of small, locally based vessels in Area 4B. It is intended to further the conservation and
management objectives of the Council with respect to the Pacific halibut fishery. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The fishery for Pacific halibut (

Hippoglossus stenolepis

) off the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California is governed by the Convention for
the Preservation of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention). The Convention
is carried out by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), which develops regulations to manage the
fishery. The Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act) was subsequently enacted to give effect to the 1979
Protocol to the Convention. 

Section 5(c) of the Halibut Act provides for the appropriate Regional Fishery Management Council under the Magnuson
Fishery Conservation and Management Act to develop regulations, including limited access regulations, governing
the United States portion of Convention waters and applicable to nationals or vessels of the United States, which
are in addition to, and not in conflict with, regulations adopted by the IPHC. Since 1987, NMFS has interpreted this
provision to mean that regulations having domestic allocation of the Pacific halibut resource as a primary purpose
would be developed by the Council with respect to Alaska and by the Pacific Fishery Management Council with respect
to Washington, Oregon, and California. 



Area 4B Allocation 



This action is designed to ameliorate the effects caused by the differing harvest abilities of vessels that catch
and land all their halibut harvest in Area 4B, principally at the Aleutian Islands community of Atka (single-area
vessels), and vessels that catch and land halibut in other areas as well as Area 4B (multiple-area vessels). Most single-area
vessels are small relative to most multiple-area vessels. This size differential means that multiple-area vessel
operators have an advantage in fishing power (i.e., a larger vessel has more space for fish, fuel, and crew) and in fishing
time (i.e., a larger vessel can be fished in weather conditions that would prevent smaller vessels from being fished).


To limit this competitive disadvantage, the Council, after reviewing data presented in the EA/RIR/Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis and public testimony, decided at its January 1994 meeting to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce
that 15 percent of the Area 4B catch limit be reserved for the early season fishery, in which there would be a 10,000 lb
(4.5 mt) fishing period (trip) limit. The IPHC, at its meeting of January 25-28, 1994, established the 1994 halibut
catch limit for Area 4B to be 2,100,000 lb (953 mt); 15 percent of this amount is 315,000 lb (143 mt). The IPHC also established
the Area 4B early season to include one 24-hour period on June 6 through 7, 1994, followed by 31 12-hour periods to occur
on every other day between June 15 and August 14, 1994. The IPHC will close all remaining 12-hour periods after the 315,000
lb (143 mt) early season catch limit is reached or add the unharvested remainder to the subsequent unrestricted fishing
periods scheduled by the IPHC to begin on August 15, 1994. 

A proposed rule to implement the Council's recommended action was published in the 

Federal Register

 April 4, 1994 (59 FR 15700). A complete description and justification for this action was presented in the preamble
to the proposed rule. Additional information is also available in the EA/RIR/FRFA. Comments on the proposed rule
were invited through April 28, 1994. No comments were received during the comment period. 



Classification 



Analysis supporting this action can be found in the EA/RIR/FRFA (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has determined under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act that good cause exists for waiving the 30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. NMFS has
proceeded with rulemaking expeditiously after receiving the EA/RIR/IRFA from the Council on February 7, 1994. The
10,000 pound (4.5 mt) fishing period (trip) limit established for the early season fishery in Regulatory Area 4B must
be effective upon the opening date of that fishery (June 6, 1994). To delay the effective date beyond June 6 would severely
undermine the intent of the Council to provide single-area vessels additional harvest opportunities in the halibut
fishery of Regulatory Area 4B. To meet the intent of the Council for the 1994 fishery, the AA is waiving the 30-day delayed
effectiveness period for this action.

Snapper-Grouper Fishery of the South Atlantic 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery
of the South Atlantic (FMP). Amendment 6 establishes management measures necessary to conserve overfished stocks
of snowy grouper, golden tilefish, speckled hind, and warsaw grouper in the South Atlantic exclusive economic zone
(EEZ). The intended effects of this rule are to rebuild the snapper-grouper resources and to clarify the regulations
implementing the FMP.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Snapper-grouper species off the southern Atlantic states are managed under the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the South
Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 646 under the
authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 


Detailed description, background, and rationale for the management measures in Amendment 6 and the additional measures
proposed by NMFS were included in the proposed rule (59 FR 9721, March 1, 1994) and are not repeated here.

Eighteen comments were received during the public comment period. Most of the comments concerned the proposed closure
of the Oculina Bank habitat area of particular concern (HAPC) to fishing for species in the snapper-grouper management
unit. 


Comment:

 Five commercial fishermen opposed the closure of the HAPC to fishing for snapper-grouper species. They stated that
the closure would reduce income to fishermen and reduce the supply of locally caught fish to wholesale and retail dealers.
They also stated that the closure of the HAPC to bottom fishing could result in a shift of fishing effort to adjacent
areas and result in overfishing of species in the open areas. They concluded that the action would result in a negative
economic impact for the Fort Pierce area, which is adjacent to the HAPC. 


Response:

 In general, the Council and NMFS agree that some fishing income could be lost and a reduction may occur in the flow of
locally caught fish to commercial channels. Also, some fishing effort may shift to open areas. A minor negative economic
impact on local communities may occur. Fishermen may target other species within the HAPC and fish in other nearby
areas; however, quantitative data do not exist to estimate these potential impacts. The HAPC is not a major fishing
area for snapper-grouper species and commercial landings from that area have never been sufficient to supply local
demand. The closure will not create a shortage of seafood in the Fort Pierce area. Some fishing effort may shift to open
areas; however, there are sufficient management measures in place and under development to regulate any additional
fishing effort. 
Presently, 13 species in the snapper-grouper fishery management unit are overfished and 14 others, with similar
life history characteristics, are thought to be overfished. The Council is concerned that traditional fishery management
measures, such as minimum size limits and quotas, may not be sufficient to protect fully the snapper-grouper resource.
The Council considered establishing marine reserves in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states but deferred action
after considering public opposition and lack of information on benefits derived from marine reserves. This HAPC
closure is a management experiment to determine the consequences of establishing a marine reserve. This measure
will ``sunset'' after 10 years if not reauthorized by the Council. NMFS is to report to the Council on the effectiveness
of the closure as soon as data are available, but no later than the end of 2000. The HAPC area was selected because it is
relatively small compared to the total area that may be fished, will have a relatively small impact on fishermen, is
already familiar to the industry, and is already subject to certain fishing restrictions under regulations implementing
the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic and the FMP (see 50
CFR parts 638 and 646). The Council believes, and NMFS agrees, that the benefits derived from this management experiment
will exceed the temporary costs to some fishermen. 


Comment:

 Five recreational fishermen and two sports fishing clubs opposed closure of the HAPC because it may result in reduced
catches. They claimed that recreational anglers might not come to the Fort Pierce area to fish, which would be detrimental
to the local economy. Also, they stated that fishing effort would shift to open areas and result in overfishing. 


Response:

 The Council and NMFS agree that some reductions in catch may occur and some anglers may switch to other fishing grounds
within and outside of the Fort Pierce area. Resulting impacts on the local economy are uncertain, but are not expected
to be significant. Since anglers can still target pelagic species such as mackerels, billfish, and sharks in the HAPC
and surrounding areas, the impacts on overall catch rates should not be major. No significant net change in domestic
economic activity will result if anglers switch to other fishing grounds located in U.S. waters. The majority of recreational
anglers do not possess vessels of sufficient size to fish the HAPC. As stated earlier, the Council and NMFS agree that
there may be some temporary, relatively minor negative impacts. In this context, if fish become abundant in the HAPC
as expected, some will move into adjacent open areas where they will be available to fishermen. Also, total recruitment
may be increased, which would result in higher catches in open areas due to the increased abundance of spawners in the
HAPC. The Council believes, and NMFS agrees, that the benefits derived from this management experiment will exceed
the temporary costs to some fishermen. If this experiment does not produce desired benefits, the fishing restrictions
will be reconsidered. 


Comment:

 The Deputy Executive Director of the Council commented that the proposed rule does not prohibit anchoring in the HAPC,
contrary to Amendment 6. 


Response:

 Amendment 6 includes a prohibition on anchoring in the HAPC as an aid to enforcement of the prohibition on fishing in
the HAPC for snapper-grouper species. Under the Magnuson Act, the scope of these regulations may not extend to a 

per se

 anchoring prohibition in the HAPC, or to non-fishing vessels. The Council did not intend to prohibit fishing in the
HAPC for fish other than snapper-grouper species. Accordingly, a prohibition on the combination of fishing and anchoring
in the HAPC more effectively meets the intent of the Council. NMFS is not aware of any fishing that would be conducted
while anchored in the HAPC other than fishing for snapper-grouper species. Accordingly, the proposed rule and this
final rule establish a rebuttable presumption that fishing while anchored in the HAPC constitutes fishing for snapper-grouper
species, which is prohibited. Further, snapper-grouper species taken in the HAPC may not be retained. Thus, a vessel
fishing in the HAPC, whether or not anchored, may not possess snapper-grouper species.

NMFS believes this final rule meets the intent of the Council regarding anchoring in the HAPC, to the extent allowable
under the Magnuson Act. 


Comment: 

Two fishermen stated that anchoring in the HAPC should not be prohibited because of safety reasons. 


Response: 

NMFS agrees; this final rule merely establishes a rebuttable presumption that a vessel fishing while at anchor in
the HAPC is fishing for snapper-grouper. 


Comment:

 One fisherman stated that the HAPC coordinates were not published in the public hearing draft of Amendment 6; therefore,
no one knew where the area was proposed to be situated. He concluded that this resulted in reduced public comment during
public hearings. 


Response:

 The coordinates of the HAPC were published on page 25 of the public hearing draft under Action 9. Figure 3 of the same
document showed the location of the HAPC, including major cities in the immediate area. Each participant at the public
hearings received a copy of Figure 3. Final Amendment 6 and the proposed rule provide similar information. Moreover,
the coordinates of the HAPC have been established in Federal regulations since July 23, 1984 (50 CFR 638.22(c)). Appendix
E (Summary of Public Comments) in Amendment 6 shows that five comments favored closing the HAPC to fishing, while seven
comments opposed it. The above information indicates that the public had adequate notice concerning the location
of the HAPC during the public hearing and proposed rule stages. 


Comment:

 One fisherman stated that a plan for scientific study of fish stocks in the HAPC was lacking and this was a violation
of the Magnuson Act. 


Response:

 Basic research needs are listed and updated periodically for each fishery management plan in the southeastern United
States. In addition, NMFS and Council staff prepare annual research plans for each fishery management plan. Research
pertaining to the HAPC will be addressed by the NMFS Science and Research Director and incorporated into the annual
research plans. NMFS must present the results of the research to the Council no later than the end of the year 2000. Finally,
sections III. B. and III. C. of FMP Amendment 4 also specifically provide for fishery data collection and periodic
scientific assessment of the condition of managed snapper and grouper stocks; these particular FMP provisions fulfill
sections 303(a) (3) and (5) of the Magnuson Act requiring the evaluation of the condition of fish stocks. In summary,
the Council and NMFS are meeting research needs indicated in this instance and are in compliance with the Magnuson
Act. 


Comment:

 Two commercial fishermen opposed the quotas for snowy grouper and golden tilefish because they believed that the
quotas would discriminate against fishermen with smaller vessels, especially those that fished in the Florida Keys.
A representative of a commercial fishing organization opposed the quotas because he felt they were not needed. 


Response:

 Both snowy grouper and golden tilefish are overfished. Therefore, regulatory guidelines require stock rebuilding
programs. The Council and NMFS believe that fishing pressure must be reduced to rebuild these species. The use of commercial
quotas is an acceptable and traditional method to reduce fishing pressure. The Council has chosen to implement quota
reductions over a 3-year period to minimize the economic impact upon commercial fishermen. Also, the Council recognizes
that some snowy grouper and golden tilefish would likely be taken as bycatch by fishermen targeting other species.
Consequently, the Council is reserving a portion of the annual snowy grouper and golden tilefish quotas as a bycatch
allowance. Fishermen will be allowed a trip limit (allowance) of 300 pounds (lb) 
(136 kilograms (kg)) after initial quotas are reached. Since fishermen in the Florida Keys with smaller vessels rarely
catch 300 lb (136 kg) of either species in a trip, their catches should not be affected by either quota. 


Comment:

 Two fishermen in the Florida Keys, who represented fishermen with smaller vessels, supported trip limits for snowy
grouper and golden tilefish. A representative of a commercial fishing organization located in the Florida Keys did
not think trip limits would adversely affect the members of that organization. 


Response:

 NMFS agrees that the commercial trip limits for snowy grouper and golden tilefish, together with the bycatch allowance
(300 lb (136 kg)) that applies after the fishing year quotas are filled, should not adversely affect fishermen with
smaller vessels. 


Comment:

 Three commercial fishermen and a representative of a commercial fishing organization were opposed to the prohibition
on sale of warsaw grouper and speckled hind. They stated that harvest of warsaw grouper and speckled hind is rare, and
these species would not survive release because of the depth of capture. One of the fishermen stated that it would not
be practical to donate these fish to a charitable organization. The representative of the commercial fishing organization
stated that the prohibition on sale would create confusion in the market and result in law enforcement difficulties.

Response

: Warsaw grouper and speckled hind are rare and overfished. The Council recognizes that most harvest of warsaw and
speckled hind is bycatch and that survival of released individuals is low. However, the Council is following stock
rebuilding guidelines with regard to these species. The Council received public testimony that some fishermen may
target these species at certain times during the year. The Council proposed the prohibition on sale to reduce directed
fishing mortality, but allowed retention of one warsaw and one speckled hind per vessel per trip to minimize waste.
Fishermen are encouraged to donate these fish to ``good causes,'' such as charitable organizations. Many marine
species in the United States are subject to restrictions on sale, either seasonally or geographically. Both the market
and law enforcement agencies have adjusted accounting procedures and other practices to implement such restrictions.



Partial Disapproval of Amendment 6 


On May 5, 1994, the
