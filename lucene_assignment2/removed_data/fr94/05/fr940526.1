FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM








Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is proposing to amend Regulation H to implement section 6(b) of the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief
Act of 1992, which authorizes state member banks to make investments designed primarily to promote the public welfare
to the extent permissible under state law and subject to regulation by the Board. The proposed amendment would permit
state member banks to make certain public welfare investments without specific Board approval and other public welfare
investments with specific approval. The proposed rule also addresses the procedural aspects of these investments.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 6(b) of the Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 added paragraph 23 to section 9 of the Federal
Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 338a. Section 6(b) removes the restriction on the ability of state member banks to purchase,
sell, underwrite, and hold investment securities provided that the investment is designed primarily to promote
the public welfare and that the investment meets certain other criteria. Specifically, the investment must not violate
state law or expose the bank to unlimited liability. The aggregate of the bank's public welfare investments must not
exceed the sum of five percent of the bank's capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and five percent of its unimpaired
surplus fund. The Board may waive this limit by order, on a case-by-case basis, however, and permit a bank to make investments
in an amount not exceeding the sum of ten percent of the capital stock actually paid in and unimpaired and ten percent
of the unimpaired surplus fund of the bank. Finally, the Board must limit a bank's investments in any one project.


In the past, requests by state member banks to make public welfare investments have been dealt with on a case-by-case
basis. To reflect section 6(b)'s amendment of the Federal Reserve Act and to facilitate public welfare investments
under that section, the Board is publishing for comment an amendment to Regulation H to be incorporated in a new section
entitled Community Development and Public Welfare Investments. This amendment would permit, in many cases, public
welfare investments without Board approval.


Core Public Welfare Investments


The proposed rule identifies classes of public welfare investments that do not require Board approval, leaving less
common investments and investments of more than five percent of a bank's capital subject to case-by-case review.
The proposed rule's classification seeks to distinguish public welfare investments from entrepreneurial investments--section
6(b) merely states that public welfare investments include investments designed primarily to promote the welfare
of low- and moderate-income communities or families. Under the proposed rule, a state member bank may invest, without
Board approval, only in a corporation, limited partnership, or other entity established solely to engage in the following
activities: low- and moderate-income housing; nonresidential real-estate development in a low- or moderate-income
area if that real-estate is used primarily by low- and moderate-income persons; job training or placement for low-
and moderate-income persons; small business development in a low- or moderate-income area; technical assistance
and credit counseling to benefit community development; and job creation in a low- or moderate-income area for low-
and moderate-income persons. The Board is particularly interested in comments on whether the test for low- and moderate-income
housing should be based on whether a majority of the units are occupied by low- and moderate-income persons or on other
Federal programs such as the low income housing credit in section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.
In defining low- and moderate-income persons and low- or moderate-income area, the proposed rule uses definitions
that will permit a state member bank to look to readily obtainable data. Specifically, the proposed rule uses the Department
of Housing and Urban Development's Chapter 69 Community Development definition of low- and moderate-income persons.
Similarly, low- or moderate-income area is defined as an area in which the median family income is less than eighty
percent of the median family income of the Metropolitan Statistical Area, or, for non-metropolitan areas, the state.
Finally, the proposed rule uses the Small Business Administration's definition of small business.


Substantive Requirements


The proposed rule contains a number of substantive requirements based on section 6(b). Specifically, the investment
must not violate state law or expose the bank to unlimited liability. In addition, without Board approval, a state
member bank's aggregate public welfare investments must not exceed the sum of 5 percent of the bank's capital stock
actually paid in and unimpaired and 5 percent of the bank's unimpaired surplus fund. The Board has previously determined
that undivided profits may be considered part of the capital stock and surplus of a state member bank (12 CFR 250.152).
Accordingly, the proposed rule limits aggregate public welfare investments without Board approval to up to five
percent of the capital stock and surplus of the state member bank. 
Section 6(b) also requires that the Board limit investments by a state member bank in any one public welfare investment.
Investment of up to two percent of the bank's capital and surplus would not threaten the safety or soundness of a well-run
adequately-capitalized bank. In addition, previous community development investments by state member banks have
not approached this ceiling. Accordingly, the proposed rule limits a state member bank to investing not more than
two percent of its capital and surplus in a single investment without Board approval.
The proposed rule also establishes certain non-statutory substantive requirements for state member banks seeking
to make public welfare investments without Board approval. Specifically, the bank must be at least adequately capitalized
and rated a composite CAMEL ``1'' or ``2'', and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, cease and desist
order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Board or a Federal Reserve Bank acting
under delegated authority. These requirements help to ensure that the investment is consistent with the safe and
sound operation of the bank. 


Procedural Requirements


The proposed rule sets forth four procedural requirements. First, to keep Federal Reserve Banks apprised of public
welfare investments, within 30 days after making a public welfare investment, a state member bank must advise its
Reserve Bank of the amount of the investment and the identity of the corporation, limited partnership, or other entity
in which the investment is made. Second, a bank seeking to make an investment that falls outside of the investments
specified in the proposed rule must receive Board approval. In no event may aggregate investments exceed ten percent
of the bank's capital stock and surplus. Third, if a public welfare investment entered into under the proposed rule
ceases to meet the statutory requirements or any requirements established by the Board in granting approval, the
bank must divest itself of the investment to the extent that the investment ceases to meet those requirements.
 Finally, if a preexisting public welfare investment meets the requirements for investments which do not need Board
approval, or if the Board approved the investment, the bank need only notify its Reserve Bank of the investment within
sixty days after the effective date of the final rule. For other preexisting public welfare investments, the bank
should apply to the Board for approval of the investment within one year after the final rule's effective date.



Bank Holding Company Investments


In the event that the Board adopts a final rule permitting state member banks to make the proposed public welfare investments
discussed above, the Board will consider revising its interpretation of Regulation Y to permit the same class of investments
to be made by bank holding companies. If revised accordingly, a bank holding company could apply to make those investments
under the existing expedited notice procedures. 
To deal with proposed public welfare investments by state member banks during the pendency of the proposed rule, the
Board has delegated to the Director of the Division of Bank Supervision and Regulation, in consultation with the General
Counsel and the Director of the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, the authority to approve investments
that meet the requirements of the proposed rule.


Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis


Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board certifies that the proposed amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and that any impact on those entities should be positive. The proposed amendments will reduce the
regulatory burden for many state member banks by permitting them to make certain investments that had previously
required Board approval, and will have no effect in other cases.

Airworthiness Directives: Terra Corporation TRT 250 Series Transponder



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to the Terra Corporation
TRT 250 series transponder (transponder). This proposal would require removing the transponder from the aircraft,
inspecting it to determine if the AD applies, and replacing any affected transponder with a modified Terra Corporation
transponder or another transponder that responds properly to Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode S ground
station and TCAS II airborne equipment. This proposal is prompted by FAA tests that show that the transponder does
not reply to certain interrogations by a Mode S or Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II signal. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the transponder to reply to Mode S interrogations from
both Mode S ground stations and TCAS II airborne equipment which could result in loss of airspace separation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited




Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained is this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-SW-03-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.



Availability of NPRMs



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention:
Rules Docket No. 94-SW-03-AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137-4298.



Discussion



This notice proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD), that is applicable to the Terra Corporation
TRT 250 transponder, part number (P/N) 0900-0250-00, with serial numbers (S/N) 4194 and below, Modification
Level (Mod Level) 4 and below; 3-inch ATI-mounted TRT 250 push-button transponders, P/N 0900-0250-20,
with S/N 5324 and below, Mod Level 4 and below; and, TRT 250 D digital display transponders, P/N 0900-0250-30,
with S/N 1155 and below, Mod Level 1 and below (transponder). Recent FAA tests have shown that these transponders do
not reply to Air Traffic Control Radio Beacon System (ATCRBS) only or ATCRBS/Mode S ``all-call'' interrogations
by a Mode S ground sensor. The affected transponder processes interrogation data beyond the P

3

 pulse as an invalid interrogation, which causes it to suppress the reply. The Mode S ground stations and the TCAS II
airborne equipment interrogates beyond the P

3

 pulse. This inability of the affected transponder to reply to valid interrogations creates an unsafe condition.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the transponder to reply to Mode S interrogations from
Mode S ground stations and TCAS II airborne equipment, which could result in loss of airspace separation.

The FAA has reviewed and approved Terra Corporation Mandatory Service Bulletin SB-104, dated March 14, 1994,
that describes procedures for modifying the transponder and then performing a final test procedure on the transponder
unit.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require, within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, removal of the transponders
to determine the P/N, S/N, and Mod Level. This proposal would also require replacement of any affected transponder
with an appropriately modified Terra Corporation transponder or another transponder that responds properly to
Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode S ground station and TCAS II airborne equipment.

The FAA has temporarily altered the Mode S ground sensors to permit the affected transponder to function normally.
However, in order to make the Mode S ground sensors operational in support of the new national digital communication
data link implementation, this temporary alteration will be removed following the replacement of all the affected
transponders. The AD proposes to allow 6 months for replacement of the affected transponders.

The FAA estimates that 5,000 aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1.5 work hours to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts
would cost approximately $298 per transponder. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposal on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $1,902,500.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

The Proposed Amendment



Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:



PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES



1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.



 39.13 

[Amended]



2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:






Terra Corporation: 

Docket No. 94-SW-03-AD.






Applicability: 

Model TRT 250 transponders, part number (P/N) 0900-0250-00, with serial numbers (S/N) 4194 and below,
Modification Level (Mod Leval) 4 and below; 3-inch ATI-mounted TRT 250 push-button transponders, P/N 0900-0250-20,
with S/N 5324 and below, Mod Levels 4 and below; and, TRT 250 D digital display transponders, P/N 0900-0250-30,
with S/N 1155 and below, Mod Level 1 and below (transponder).



Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the transponder to respond properly
to Mode S interrogations from Mode S ground stations and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II airborne equipment,
which could result in loss of airspace separation, accomplish the following:

(a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, remove the TRT 250 series transponder in accordance with the
procedures stated in the Accomplishment Section of Terra Corporation Mandatory Service Bulletin No. SB-104
(SB-104), dated March 14, 1994, and determine the part number (P/N), serial number (S/N), and modification
level (Mod Level).

(b) If the determination made in paragraph (a) reveals one of the affected part numbers, serial numbers, and modification
levels indicated in this AD, replace the affected transponder with:

(1) A Terra Corporation transponder that has modified in accordance with the provisions of SB-104, dated March
14, 1994;

(2) An unaffected Terra Corporation transponder; or,

(3) Another manufacturer's transponder that responds properly to Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode
S ground station and TCAS II airborne equipment.

(c) If installing a replacement Terra Corporation transponder that has been modified in accordance with the provisions
of SB-104, dated March 14, 1994, perform a ramp test in accordance with the Testing section of SB-104, dated
March 14, 1994. Conduct the tests and checks required by  91.413 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR
91.413) prior to approving the aircraft for return to service.

(d) Installation of an affected Terra Corporation transponder modified and tested in accordance with SB-104,
dated March 14, 1994, or another transponder that responds properly to Mode S interrogations from both an ATCRBS/Mode
S ground station and TCAS II airborne equipment constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD.


(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Airplane Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators
shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send
it to the Manager, Airplane Certification Office.







Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Airplance Certification Office.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Louisiana Program



On October 10, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Louisiana program. General background
information on the Louisiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the
conditions of approval of the Louisiana program can be found in the October 10, 1980, 

Federal Register

II. Proposed Amendment



By letter dated May 3, 1994, Louisiana submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative
record No. LA-348). Louisiana submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The provision of LSMR
that Louisiana proposes to revise is  53123.B.4, standards for success of revegetation at final bond release
on reclaimed lands developed for forestry.

Specifically, Louisiana proposes to review  53123.B.4 to require that the success standards for (1) ``live
stems per acre'' shall be 




450 well-distributed free-to-grow live pine trees per acre of the same age or 250 well-distributed live hardwood
trees per acre of the same age. Countable stems shall be a minimum of 3 years old.




and (2) ``vegetative ground cover'' shall be not less than 70 percent.



Louisiana also proposed to define at  53123.B.4, ``well-distributed'' to mean uniform stocking levels over
an entire planting site, ``free-to-grow'' to mean pine seedlings or saplings without significant hardwood competition,
and to require that




Competing vegetation shade the pine's crown on less than 30% of the crown's circumference and the pines are judged
to have better than a 90% chance of capturing a place in the crown canopy.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Louisiana program.



1. Written Comments



Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Tulsa Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.



2. Public Hearing



Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., c.d.t. on June 10, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.

Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.

The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.

IV. Procedural Determinations



1. Executive Order 12866




This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30
U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.



3. National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



4. Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).



5. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 

et seq

.). The State submittal that is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the receipt of proposed Program Amendment Number 68 to the Ohio permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
the Ohio program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment was initiated
by Ohio and is intended to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning
contemporaneous reclamation. Specifically, the amendment proposes to define the terms ``area mining'' and ``contour
mining,'' to establish time and distance schedules for backfilling and grading for mining methods other than area
and contour mining, to require the contemporaneous commencement of augering, and to require a description of the
mining method in the operation plan contained in the permit.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background on the Ohio Program



On August 16, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Ohio program. Background information
on the Ohio program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval

II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2018), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 68. In this amendment, Ohio proposes
to revise three rules in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) to make the Ohio program as effective as the corresponding
Federal regulations concerning contemporaneous reclamation. The specific rule revisions proposed by Ohio in this
amendment are briefly described below.

1. 

OAC section 1501:13-1-02 paragraph (J):

 Ohio is adding this new paragraph to define the term ``mining area.''

2. 

OAC section 1501:13-4-02 paragraph (CC):

 Ohio is adding this new paragraph to define the term ``contour mining.''

3. 

OAC section 1501:13-4-05 paragraphs (A)(2)(a) (i) through (iv):

 Ohio is adding these new paragraphs to require that the mining operation plan in permit applications shall identify
the mining method to be used and, depending on that proposed mining method, the maximum extent of cover to be mined,
the beginning and ending point of the mining, the direction of mining, spoil placement plans, the locations of haul
roads, the intended timing of the mining operation, and any other information that demonstrates an orderly and reasonable
progression of mining and that specifies how the mining operation will meet the contemporaneous reclamation requirements
of OAC section 1501:13-9-13.

4. 

OAC section 1501:13-4-05 paragraph (D)(2)(a):

 Ohio is revising this paragraph to require that reclamation plans in the permit application shall contain a detailed
timetable for the completion of each major step of the reclamation plan specific to the described mining method and
addressing the contemporaneous reclamation requirements of OAC section 1501:13-9-13.

5. 

OAC section 1501:13-9-13 paragraphs (A) (1) through (6):

 Ohio is revising these paragraphs to clarify the rule language, to specify minimum time and distance requirements
for backfilling and grading for mining methods other than contour or area mining, and to require the contemporaneous
commencement of augering after the creation of the highwall to be augered.

6. 

OAC section 1501:13-9-13 paragraph (A)(7):

 Ohio is adding this new paragraph to clarify that areas that are backfilled and rough graded shall closely resemble
the final ground surface configuration approved in the mining and reclamation plan but that these areas are not necessarily
ready for resoiling or eligible for Phase I bond release.

As part of and in support of proposed Program Amendment Number 68, Ohio has also submitted a draft Policy/Procedure
Directive which provides additional clarification and guidance on the proposed Ohio rule requirements for contemporaneous
reclamation.

II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated May 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. OH-2017), the Ohio Department of Natural Resources,
Division of Reclamation (Ohio), submitted proposed Program Amendment Number 67. In this amendment, Ohio proposes
to revise one rule at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) section 1501:13-9-17 to make the Ohio program as effective
as the corresponding Federal regulations concerning postmining land uses. The specific rule revisions proposed
by Ohio in this amendment are briefly described below.

1. 

Postmining land use categories:

 Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(1) through (C)(11) to clarify the titles of the eleven approved postmining land use
categories.

2. 

Mining prior to April 10, 1972:

 Ohio is revising paragraph (B)(1) to clarify that the postmining land use for land that was mined pursuant to a license
issued prior to April 10, 1972, shall be judged on the basis of the highest and best use that can be achieved which is compatible
with surrounding areas and does not require the disturbance of areas previously unaffected by mining.

3. 

Comparison of postmining and premining land uses:

 Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that, if the premining land use was changed within five
years of the beginning of mining, the postmining land use shall be compared to the historic use of the land as well as
its use immediately before mining.

4. 

Undeveloped land use:

 Ohio is adding a new requirement in paragraph (B)(2) that land may be returned to the undeveloped postmining land use
category only if the land was categorized as undeveloped prior to mining.

Ohio is revising paragraph (C) to require that all proposed changes of land use, including changes from undeveloped
land to forestland or fish and wildlife habitat, shall be considered an alternative land use change subject to approval
by the Chief of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (the Chief).

Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(8) that plans to change the postmining land use to undeveloped
land from some other land use category must treat the land as if the postmining land use were in the forestland/fish
and wildlife habitat category.

5. 

Forestland and Fish and Wildlife Habitat:

 Ohio is revising paragraphs (C)(9) and (C)(10) to clarify that ``forestland'' and ``fish and wildlife habitat''
are distinct postmining land uses. The ``forest'' category includes land used for commercial or noncommercial production
of wood or wood products.

6. 

Agency review of postmining land uses:

 Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that requests for alternative postmining land use
must contain a written statement of views from the authorities having statutory responsibilities for land use policies
and plans. Ohio is also deleting the requirement in paragraph (D)(1) that the operator must obtain any required approval
of the final land use from local, State, or Federal land management agencies, including any necessary zoning or other
required changes.

Ohio is revising paragraph (D)(6) to clarify that, for approval by the Chief, proposed alternative postmining land
uses must identify measures to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on fish and wildlife and on threatened or endangered
plants or animals or their critical habitats and must demonstrate that an opportunity to comment has been provided
in accordance with OAC section 1501:13-9-11 to appropriate State and Federal fish and wildlife management
agencies.

Ohio is deleting the existing requirement in paragraph (D)(9) that alternative postmining land use plans must demonstrate
that the operator has provided written notice of the proposed land use to appropriate State and Federal agencies with
instructions for those agencies to provide any comments on the proposed land use to the Chief.

7. 

Design of postmining land use plans by an engineer:

 Ohio is deleting the existing requirement at paragraph (D)(2) that postmining land use plans must be designed under
the general supervision of a registered engineer or other appropriate professional.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is now seeking comment on whether the amendment proposed
by Ohio satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate,
it will become part of the Ohio program.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Reopening of Comment Period and Notice of Public Hearing on Proposed
Endangered Status for the Barton Springs Salamander



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) provides notice that a public hearing will be held on the proposed determination
of endangered status for the Barton Springs salamander (

Eurycea sosorum

) and that the comment period on the proposal is reopened. This salamander is found only in Barton Springs, Travis County,
Texas. All interested parties are invited to submit comments on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background




The Baron Springs salamander is completely aquatic and currently known only from Barton Springs in Travis County,
Texas. The salamander is threatened by contamination of the waters that feed Barton Springs, reduced groundwater
supplies, and disturbances to its surface habitat in the pools where it is found (such as use of chemicals and high pressure
hoses for pool cleaning).

On February 17, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7968) to list the Barton Springs salamander as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as
amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.). Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within 45 days of the proposal's
publication in the 

Federal Register

. The first public hearing request received within the allotted time period came from Mr. Jon Beall, President of the
Save Barton Creek Association, Austin, Texas. Several other hearing requests were subsequently received.

The Service has scheduled the requested hearing in two sessions, from 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
on June 16, 1994, at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Auditorium, Lyndon Baines Johnson Library Complex, 2315 Red River Street,
University of Texas campus, Austin, Texas. Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to
provide a written copy of their statement at the start of the hearing. So that everyone has the opportunity to make an
oral statement, each person who wishes to do so should make their statement at only one of the sessions. In the event
there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may have to be limited. Oral and written statements
receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed
to the Service. 

The comment period on the proposed rule originally closed on April 18, 1994. The Service finds that good cause exists
to reopen the comment period to accommodate the hearing. Written comments may now be submitted until July 1, 1994,
to the Service office in the ADDRESS section. The Service will also accept comments received between April 18, 1994,
and the publication date of this notice.

Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this proposed rule to implement Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources
of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP). Amendment 9 would extend the current reef fish permit moratorium from its scheduled expiration
on May 8, 1995, through as late as December 31, 1995. For the red snapper segment of the reef fish fishery, Amendment
9 would authorize the collection of commercial landings data for the years 1990 through 1992 and the collection of
information to identify certain participants. It would also extend the red snapper endorsement system and its associated
trip and landing limits from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995.
The intended effects of this rule are to collect information needed to evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives,
to identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime, and
to continue interim management measures until the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Council) has an opportunity
to implement longer-term measures. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The reef fish fishery of the Gulf of Mexico is managed under the FMP, which was prepared by the Council and is implemented
through regulations at 50 CFR part 641 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
(Magnuson Act). 


Amendment 9 would: (1) Authorize the collection of historical red snapper landings data needed to evaluate red snapper
effort management alternatives and to qualify individuals for initial shares; and (2) extend the moratorium on additional
reef fish permits and the red snapper endorsement system, including its associated trip and landing limits, through
December 31, 1995, unless replaced earlier by a red snapper effort management system. Red snapper commercial landings
data for 1990, 1991, and 1992 would be collected for vessels according to owner and, in the case of permitted vessels
for which the permit was based on the earned income qualification of an operator, according to such operator. Data
would also be collected to identify ``historical captains'' in the red snapper fishery and their share arrangements
with vessel owners. 


Rationale for Proposed Actions 


Historical Captains 


After review of testimony and recommendations of the Council's Ad Hoc Allocation Advisory Panel, the Council determined
that historical captains should be considered for fishing privileges under a red snapper effort management system,
as well as vessel owners and operators whose earned income qualified for the vessel permit. The eligibility criteria
for determining historical captain status were designed to discourage submission of applications by recent entrants
to the fishery desiring to qualify for the effort management system. 
To establish status as a historical captain for purposes of the effort management system, a captain must have: 
(1) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under a verbal or written share agreement with an owner to lease
a vessel, such agreement providing for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who were paid from his or
her share; 
(2) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992;
and 
(3) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in each
of the years 1989 through 1993. 


Proposed Data Collection 


The proposed submittal of red snapper landings data to NMFS was requested by vessel owners, operators whose earned
income qualified for the vessel permit, and historical captains who are interested in learning of their possible
preliminary shares for planning purposes. This information will help fishermen determine their most likely level
of participation in an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system, if adopted for the fishery. This also will help
the Council and the industry decide whether to proceed with an ITQ system, as included in draft Amendment 8 to the FMP.

<PARENT> FR940526-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under Amendment 9, persons wishing to participate in a limited access system must submit their landings data for consideration
at this time. These landings data submitted to NMFS will cover all vessel owners, operators whose earned income qualified
for the vessel permit, and historical captains who may qualify under a red snapper effort management system. Collection
of landings information for the 1990-1992 period, for which data are readily available, will provide the Council
with a complete data base and should obviate the need for collecting these data for that time period under proposed
Amendment 8. 
In its final decisions on Amendment 9, the Council recognized that it would be unnecessarily burdensome for historical
captains to submit data that duplicate those provided by the vessel owners/operators. Accordingly, the collection
of landings data from fishery participants under this rule is designed to avoid duplication of information available
to NMFS. 


Extension of Reef Fish Permit Moratorium and Red Snapper Endorsement


The reef fish permit moratorium was implemented on May 8, 1992, for 3 years ending May 8, 1995, to prevent speculative
entry, as had previously occurred, while the Council considers other reef fish management alternatives. The red
snapper endorsement and trip limit provisions were established by emergency action, and continued through December
31, 1994, under Amendment 6 to the FMP. The purpose of the action was to prevent an extremely short season and a ``derby''
fishery, such as occurred in 1992. 
The problems in the fishery that led to implementation of the permit moratorium and the red snapper endorsement system
are expected to persist until a more comprehensive program to limit access to the red snapper fishery is in place. The
Council anticipates that the reef fish fishery, particularly for red snapper, would be unnecessarily disrupted
if the moratorium and red snapper endorsement provisions were to expire before implementation of a limited access
system; but the Council believes the moratorium should not be continued indefinitely. The Council's target date
for implementing a limited access system, if one of the current management options under consideration is adopted,
is January 1, 1996. Accordingly, the Council determined that the permit moratorium and red snapper endorsement system
should be extended through December 31, 1995, or until such limited access system is implemented, whichever is earlier.



Additional Changes Proposed by NMFS 


In addition to the measures contained in Amendment 9, NMFS proposes the following changes to clarify the regulations.

In Amendment 4 to the FMP, which contained the moratorium on additional permits in the reef fish fishery, and in Amendment
5 to the FMP, which contained the moratorium on additional participants in the fish trap segment of the reef fish fishery,
the Council specified that a permit or fish trap endorsement that is not renewed will not be reissued. A permit/endorsement
is considered to have been ``not renewed'' when a complete application for renewal is not received within one year
after the expiration date of the permit. This criterion is based on the fact that permits are generally issued for a
period of one year. NMFS considers this criterion to be consistent with the Council's intent, and it has been consistently
applied. For clarity, NMFS proposes to include this criterion in the regulations at  641.4(m)(4) and (p)(5).

Regulations implementing Amendment 7 to the FMP allow the transfer of a fish trap endorsement when ownership of a vessel
with a fish trap endorsement is transferred to certain relatives of the owner (see 50 CFR 641.4 as amended on February
7, 1994 (59 FR 6588, February 11, 1994)). In accordance with the Council's intent, NMFS proposes to amend the regulations
at  641.4(p)(4) to clarify that such new owner may renew the fish trap endorsement without having to meet the
requirements applicable to the initial issuance of the endorsement, that is, a history of reef fish landings from
traps. 
In the restrictions applicable in the longline and buoy gear restricted area and in the special management zone (SMZ),
at  641.23(b)(1) and (d)(2), respectively, the specification of what constitutes ``fishing for reef fish''
may be interpreted as a change in the definition of ``fishing,'' so that possession of reef fish, or certain quantities
of reef fish, aboard a vessel while in transit of the restricted area or SMZ would be prohibited. The intent of the measures
is to restrict harvesting in these areas, and not possession of reef fish while in transit. To achieve the intended
result, NMFS proposes revised language to clarify that the definition of ``fishing'' is not changed. 


Classification 


This proposed rule is exempt from prepublication review for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because no
reduction in gross revenues is expected and capital costs of compliance are not expected to be significant. As a result,
a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. 
Section 641.10 of this proposed rule, concerning the collection of data on red snapper, contains two collection-of-information
requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_ specifically, information on landings of red snapper and documentation
of status as a historical captain in the red snapper fishery. Requests to collect this information have been submitted
to OMB for approval. The public reporting burdens for these collections of information are estimated to average 2
and 5 hours per response, respectively, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information.
Send comments regarding these reporting burden estimates or any other aspects of the collections of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to NMFS and OMB (see 

ADDRESSES

 641.10 

Red snapper data collection. 


(a) 

General. 

(1) To evaluate red snapper effort management alternatives, including individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems
and license limitations, it is necessary to obtain commercial red snapper landings data for the years 1990 through
1992. To identify individuals who may qualify for initial participation in a red snapper effort management regime,
it is necessary to identify certain participants in the red snapper fishery, specifically, operators of vessels
who were the earned income qualifiers for the vessels' reef fish permits and those who are ``historical captains.''
In the latter case, documentation of a historical captain's share agreement with the vessel's owner is also required.

(2) For the purpose of the red snapper effort limitation alternatives, a historical captain means an operator who_
(i) From November 6, 1989, through 1993, fished solely under a verbal or written share agreement with an owner to lease
a vessel, such agreement provided for the operator to be responsible for hiring the crew, who were paid from his or her
share; 
(ii) Landed from that vessel at least 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) of red snapper per year in 2 of the 3 years 1990, 1991, and 1992;
and 
(iii) Derived more than 50 percent of his or her earned income from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch, in
each of the years 1989 through 1993. 
(3) The data collection described in this section will be the only collection for the effort management alternatives
currently being considered by the Council. Accordingly, failure to submit requested data may result in failure to
be included among the initial participants in the red snapper fishery under an effort management system and/or failure
to obtain the full initial share of red snapper to which a person may be entitled under an ITQ regime. 
(b) 

Existing data. 

(1) NMFS has records of all red snapper landings reported by vessel logbook forms submitted pursuant to  641.5
(a) or (b) and has access to records of red snapper landings reported under Florida's trip ticket system. NMFS also
has records of the earned income qualifier for each vessel permit issued for reef fish. Data duplicating these records
are not needed. 
(2) Landings of red snapper reported by vessel logbook forms and received by the Science and Research Director prior
to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to red snapper landed during the months that such logbook forms were required
of, or voluntarily submitted by, a vessel_landings data from other sources will not be considered for such months.
In the absence of landings data from such logbook forms, landings of red snapper reported under Florida's trip ticket
system and received by the State prior to September 16, 1992, are conclusive as to landings in Florida_ landings data
from other sources will not be considered for landings in Florida. However, vessel owners/operators will be given
printouts of their logbook/trip ticket records of landings and will have an opportunity to submit records they believe
were omitted. 
(c) 

Additional landings data. 

(1) An owner or operator who wishes to be considered for initial participation in the red snapper fishery under an effort
management system may submit documentation of red snapper landings not covered by vessel logbook forms or the Florida
trip ticket system. 
(i) Such documentation may consist of copies of trip receipts that show dates and amounts of landings of red snapper.
Trip receipts must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name, official number, or other
reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. 
(ii) Such documentation may also consist of dealer records that show dates and amounts of landings of red snapper.
As with trip receipts, dealer records must definitively show the species known as red snapper and the vessel's name,
official number, or other reference that provides a way of clearly identifying the vessel. Dealer records must contain
a sworn affidavit by the dealer confirming the accuracy and authenticity of the records. A sworn affidavit is an official
written statement wherein the individual signing the affidavit affirms that the information presented is accurate
and can be substantiated, under penalty of law. 
(iii) Documentation by a combination of trip receipts and dealer records is acceptable, but duplicate records for
the same landings are not acceptable. 
(2) Red snapper landings data will not be accepted_
(i) For a period during which the harvesting vessel did not have a permit, provided a permit was required during such
period. Permits were not required from January 1 through April 22, 1990, and from January 1 through 31, 1992. 
(ii) For a period during which the commercial red snapper fishery in the EEZ was closed. The commercial red snapper
fishery was closed in the EEZ from August 24 through December 31, 1991, from February 22 through April 2, 1992, and from
May 15 through December 31, 1992.

(3) Additional landings data submitted under this paragraph (c) must be attached to a Red Snapper Landings Data form,
which is available from the Regional Director, and must be postmarked between the effective date of the final rule
and a date not later than the date 60 days from effective date of the final rule. 
(

d) Historical captains. 

(1) An operator who wishes to be considered for status as a historical captain in the red snapper fishery under an effort
management system may submit documentation of such status by providing the following: 
(i) A Historical Captain Status form, available from the Regional Director, which requests information necessary
to determine such status and information to establish the share agreement of a historical captain with the vessel's
owner; 
(ii) A Red Snapper Landings Data form and accompanying additional landings data pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
section, if such form and data have not been submitted by a vessel owner; 
(iii) Copies of forms and schedules from the applicant's income tax returns for the years 1989 through 1993 that show
total earned income and that part of earned income derived from commercial fishing, that is, sale of the catch (generally,
pages 1 and 2 of Form 1040, W-2's, and Schedule C); and 
(iv) Documentation of a landing of red snapper prior to November 7, 1989. 
(2) Forms and information submitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be postmarked between the effective
date of the final rule and the date 60 days from effective date of the final rule. 
(e) 

Verification. 

Documentation of red snapper landings, documentation of status as a historical captain, and other information submitted
under this section are subject to verification by comparison with state, Federal, and other records and information.
Submission of false documentation or information may disqualify a person from initial participation under a red
snapper effort management system. 
5. In  641.23, paragraphs (b)(1) introductory text and (d)(2) introductory text are revised to read as follows:



 641.23 

Area limitations. 


* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(1) Longline and buoy gear may not be used to fish for reef fish in the longline and buoy gear restricted area. For the
purpose of this paragraph (b), ``for reef fish'' means possessing or landing reef fish_ 


* * * * * 


(d) * * *
(2) In the SMZ specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, fishing for reef fish is limited to hook-and-line gear
with three or fewer hooks per line and spearfishing gear. For the purpose of this paragraph (d), ``for reef fish'' means
possessing reef fish aboard or landing reef fish from_
