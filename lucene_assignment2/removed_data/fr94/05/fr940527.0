Food Stamp Program: Modifying the Limit on Civil Money Penalties for Trafficking in Benefit Redemption Instruments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 includes several provisions which amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977,
as amended (the Act). This final rule implements those nondiscretionary provisions pertaining to increased limits
for civil money penalties for trafficking in benefit redemption instruments and for selling firearms, ammunition,
explosives, or controlled substances for benefit redemption instruments. The intended effect of this rule is to
raise the amounts of civil money penalties paid by authorized firms for the types of violations specified.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Classification



Executive Order 12866



This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purpose of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by OMB.



Executive Order 12372



The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related Notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983, or 48 FR 54317,
December 1, 1983, as appropriate, and any subsequent notices that may apply), this program is excluded from the scope
of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. No. 96-354).
The Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this action does not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would have almost no impact on the vast majority of authorized
firms, most of which follow the program rules carefully.



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain recordkeeping or reporting requirements subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).



Executive Order 12778



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) for program benefit recipients_state administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020 (e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities)
or Part 283 (for rules related to QC liabilities); (3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures
issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8.



Public Participation and Justification for Less than a Thirty-day Effective Date



This action is being finalized without prior notice or public comment under authority of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A) and
(B). The matters addressed by this rulemaking are nondiscretionary. The provisions in this rule have already been
implemented and were effective on October 1, 1993. Therefore, the Department has determined in accordance with 5
U.S.C. 553(b) that Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Opportunity for Public Comments is unnecessary and contrary
to the public interest and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d), finds that good cause exists for making this action
effective prior to the date of publication.

Background 


Section 344 of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988, 
Pub. L. No. 100-435, provided the Secretary with authority to 
impose a civil money penalty (CMP) of up to $20,000 per violation 
in lieu of a permanent disqualification of a firm for trafficking 
in food stamps or other program benefit instruments, if the 
Secretary determines that there is substantial evidence that the 
firm had an effective policy and program in effect to prevent 
trafficking violations. Section 1743 of the Food, Agriculture 
and Trade Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-624, limited the CMP 
authority to $40,000 over a two-year period, and extended the 
same authority to firms which exchange firearms, ammunition, 
explosives or controlled substances for coupons. Current 
regulations at 7 CFR 278.6(j) specify, in accordance with the 
Act, that such CMP's shall not exceed $20,000 for each violation, 
and shall not exceed $40,000 during a two-year period. 
Section 13943 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1993 (Pub. L. No. 103-66) further amends Section 12(b)(3)(B) of 
the Act 7 U.S.C. 2021(b)(3)(B) to modify the monetary cap on CMPs 
by applying the $40,000 cap to each single investigation, rather 
than to a two-year period of time. Further, Section 13944 of 
Pub. L. No. 103-66 amends Section 12(b)(3)(C) of the Act to make 
the same modification to the $40,000 cap on CMPs for the sale of 
firearms, ammunition, explosives, or controlled substances for 
food stamps (or other benefit redemption instruments). 
Accordingly, this rulemaking provides at 7 CFR 278.6 that a 
CMP in lieu of permanent disqualification for trafficking may not 
exceed $40,000 for all violations occurring during a 

single investigation

. The $20,000 limit per trafficking violation in a 
single investigation remains unchanged. This rulemaking also 
makes a conforming change in the definition of trafficking at 7 
CFR 271.2. by eliminating unnecessary wording.

Commuted Traveltime Periods: Overtime Services Relating to Imports and Exports 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning overtime services provided by employees of Plant Protection and Quarantine
by removing and adding commuted traveltime allowances for travel between various locations in Florida, Mississippi,
and Tennessee. Commuted traveltime allowances are the periods of time required for Plant Protection and Quarantine
employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday,
or other overtime duty. The Government charges a fee for certain overtime services provided by Plant Protection and
Quarantine employees and, under certain circumstances, the fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. This
action is necessary to inform the public of commuted traveltime for these locations.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The regulations in 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, subchapter D, require inspection, laboratory testing,
certification, or quarantine of certain plants, plant products, animals, animal byproducts, or other commodities
intended for importation into, or exportation from, the United States. When these services must be provided by an
employee of Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) on a Sunday or holiday, or at any other time outside the PPQ employee's
regular duty hours, the Government charges a fee for the services in accordance with 7 CFR part 354. Under circumstances
described in  354.1(a)(2), this fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. Section 354.2 contains administrative
instructions prescribing commuted traveltime allowances, which reflect, as nearly as practicable, the periods
of time required for PPQ employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they
perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. 

We are amending  354.2 of the regulations by removing and adding commuted traveltime allowances for travel
between various locations in Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The amendments are set forth in the rule portion
of this document. This action is necessary to inform the public of the commuted traveltime between the dispatch and
service locations. 



Effective Date 



The commuted traveltime allowances appropriate for employees performing services at ports of entry, and the features
of the reimbursement plan for recovering the cost of furnishing port of entry services, depend upon facts within the
knowledge of the Department of Agriculture. It does not appear that public participation in this rulemaking proceeding
would make additional relevant information available to the Department. 

Accordingly, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, we find upon good cause that prior
notice and other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and unnecessary; we also find good cause
for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 

The number of requests for overtime services of a PPQ employee at the locations affected by our rule represents an insignificant
portion of the total number of requests for these services in the United States. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that conflict with its provisions
or that would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There
are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this
rule or the application of its provisions. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 



This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 354 



Exports, Government employees, Imports, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Travel and transportation expenses. 




Accordingly, 7 CFR part 354 is amended as follows: 


PART 354_OVERTIME SERVICES RELATING TO IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; AND USER FEES 


1. The authority citation for part 354 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 2260; 21 U.S.C. 136 and 136a; 49 U.S.C. 1741; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).

<USDEPT>UNITED STATES ENRICHMENT CORPORATION</USDEPT>






Freedom of Information Act Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States Enrichment Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Enrichment Corporation (Corporation) is adopting this final rule pursuant to the Freedom of Information
Act (FOIA). The implementing regulations establish procedures for the disclosure of information by the Corporation
under FOIA. The objective of these implementing regulations is to facilitate the exercise of rights conferred on
the public by FOIA and to ensure that the Corporation's determinations regarding disclosure of information are in
compliance with FOIA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14789), the Corporation published a proposed rule pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act,
5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA). The period for public comment extended through April 29, 1994. The Corporation received no comments
with regard to the proposed rule. These final regulations are adopted by the Corporation, without change, as published
below. 



Background



The United States Enrichment Corporation (Corporation), an agency and instrumentality of the United States, was
established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486; 42 U.S.C. 2297 

et seq.

) as a wholly owned Government corporation. On July 1, 1993, the Corporation assumed responsibility for the majority
of the uranium enrichment enterprise activities formerly conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy. Since that
date, the Corporation has been the exclusive marketing agent for the U.S. Government for entering into contracts
for providing enriched uranium and uranium enrichment and related services. In connection with its legitimate activities,
the Corporation possesses records that may fall within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C.
552. Consequently, the Corporation is promulgating these implementing regulations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)
to ensure compliance with the provisions of FOIA. 

In general, FOIA provides for public access to records in the possession of the Corporation, while preserving the
Corporation's ability to protect certain specifically exempted material from disclosure. Specifically, FOIA
requires the Corporation to publish certain information in the 

Federal Register

, including a description of the organization of the Corporation and substantive rules of general applicability,
and make other information available for public inspection and copying, including statements of policy and interpretations
adopted by the Corporation which are not published in the 

Federal Register

. FOIA also requires the Corporation to make records available in response to a request which (i) reasonably describes
such records; and (ii) is made in accordance with these implementing regulations, which state the time, place, fees
and procedures to be followed. The Corporation, however, will not treat records that have been prepared by a contractor,
and are available to the Corporation pursuant to the terms of a contract between the Corporation and the contractor,
but which have not been delivered to the Corporation, as ``records'' available in response to a request made in accordance
with these implementing regulations. Finally, FOIA exempts specific categories of matters from disclosure pursuant
to a request for information made under these implementing regulations. For example, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) exempts
those matters which are ``specifically exempted from disclosure by statute * * * provided that such
statute'' meets certain criteria. Recognizing the unique status of the Corporation as a government agency with the
statutory mission to ``operate as a business enterprise on a profitable and efficient basis,'' Congress specifically
provided the Corporation with authority to ``protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information to the
same extent as a privately owned corporation,'' 42 U.S.C. 2297b-13(a). The Corporation interprets 42 U.S.C.
2297b-13(a) as being a statute covered by section (b)(3) of FOIA and anticipates that a significant amount of
the Corporation's records will fall under this exemption. 



Final Rule



As a whole, these implementing regulations provide the means necessary for the public to exercise fully the rights
provided under FOIA. Section 1102.3 establishes the Corporation's policy regarding the disclosure of Corporation
records pursuant to FOIA. Section 1102.4 establishes the availability of materials to the public as required by 5
U.S.C. 552(a) (2) and (5). Section 1102.5 establishes procedures by which the public can request access to Corporation
records which are not covered by 5 U.S.C. 552(a) (1) or (2) and time requirements regarding the Corporation's response
to such requests. Section 1102.6 establishes nine categories of matters which are exempt from all publication and
disclosure requirements of FOIA, provides for the disclosure of any reasonably segregable portion of an exempted
record subsequent to deletion of exempted portions of the record, and establishes guidance for the Corporation in
relation to providing a requesting party with information regarding exempt material. Section 1102.7 establishes
procedures for responding to a request for disclosure of records made pursuant to these implementing regulations.
Section 1102.8 establishes procedures for denying a request for disclosure of records made pursuant to these implementing
regulations. Section 1102.9 establishes procedures for the appeal of a denial of a request for disclosure of records
made pursuant to these implementing regulations. Section 1102.10 establishes the schedule of fees applicable to
the processing of requests under these implementing regulations and also establishes procedures and guidance for
determining when such fees should be waived or reduced. Section 1102.11 establishes procedures to provide submitters
of information containing confidential commercial information, as defined by Executive Order 12600, with notice
of a request for such information submitted pursuant to these implementing regulations. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



The Corporation certifies that these implementing regulations do not require additional reporting under the criteria
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.





Executive Order 12291



These implementing regulations are not a ``major rule'' within the meaning of E.O. 12291 because they: (1) do not have
an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) do not result in a major increase in the cost of financial
institution operations or governmental supervision; and (3) do not have a significant adverse effect on competition
(foreign or domestic), employment, investment productivity or innovation within the meaning of E.O. 12291. Accordingly,
a regulatory impact analysis is not required. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act



Pursuant to Section 605(b), the Corporation certifies that these implementing regulations are not expected to have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 These regulations implement FOIA, which is concerned with disclosure of records in the possession of an agency of
the Federal Government. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

other activities of the Corporation or because of the informational value of data in them. The term does not include


inter alia, 

books, magazines, or other materials acquired solely for library purposes and available through any officially
designated library of the Corporation, or records that have been prepared by a contractor, and are available to the
Corporation pursuant to the terms of a contract between the Corporation and the contractor (

e.g., 

the contract for the operation and maintenance of the Corporation's leased gaseous diffusion plants), but which
have not been delivered to the Corporation.


Representative of the news media 

means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news
to the public. The term ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest
to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at
large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'')
who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended
to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (

e.g., 

electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be
included in this category. In the case of ``freelance'' journalists, they will be regarded as working for a news organization
if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually
employed by it.


Review 

means the process of examining documents located in response to a commercial use request to determine whether any
portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any documents for disclosure,


e.g., 

doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent
resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.


Search 

means all the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line
identification of material within documents. The search should be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive
manner. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.


Working days 

means all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays.


 1102.3

Policy.


The Corporation will make records concerning its operations, activities, and business available to the public upon
request. Records will be withheld from the public only in accordance with the FOIA and this part. Records that may be
exempt from disclosure may be made available as a matter of discretion when disclosure is not prohibited by law, and
it does not appear adverse to legitimate interests of the public, the Corporation, or any person. The Corporation
will attempt to provide assistance to requesting parties, including information about how a request may be submitted.
The Corporation will act on requests for records in a timely manner.


 1102.4

Public Reading Room.


(a) The Corporation will maintain in a public reading room at its headquarters the materials which are required by
5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and (5) to be made available for public inspection and copying, unless it is determined that such
records should be withheld and are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA and  1102.6 of this part.
(b) The public reading room will maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indices of
the materials which are required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) or other applicable statutes. Because publication
of such indices is unnecessary and impracticable and because current versions thereof will be available for inspection
at the Corporation's public reading room, it is determined and so ordered that the Corporation will not publish the
indices in the Federal Register.
(c) Certain records maintained in the public reading room or otherwise made available pursuant to this part may be
``edited'' by the deletion of identifying details concerning individuals, to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy. In such cases the record shall have attached to it a full explanation of the deletion.

 1102.5

Availability of records on request.


(a) In addition to the records made available through the public reading room, the Corporation will make records available
to any person in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, unless it is determined that such records are
exempt from mandatory disclosure under the FOIA and  1102.6 of this part and that such records should be withheld
by the Corporation.
(b) 

Requests. 

(1) A request will be acceptable if it identifies a record with sufficient particularity to enable officials of the
Corporation to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. Requests seeking records within a reasonably
specific category will be deemed to conform to the statutory requirement of a request which ``reasonably describes''
such records if professional employees of the Corporation who are familiar with the subject area of the request would
be able, with a reasonable amount of effort, to determine which particular records are encompassed within the scope
of the request, and to search for, locate, and collect the records without unduly burdening or materially interfering
with operations because of the staff time consumed or the resulting disruption of files. If it is determined that a
request does not reasonably describe the records sought as specified in this paragraph, the response denying the
request on that ground shall specify the reasons why the request failed to meet the requirements of this paragraph
and shall extend to the requester an opportunity to confer with Corporation personnel in order to attempt to reformulate
the request in a manner that will meet the needs of the requester and the requirements of this paragraph. 
(2) To facilitate the location of records by the Corporation, a requester should try to provide the following kinds
of information, if known: (i) the specific event or action to which the record refers; (ii) the unit or program of the
Corporation which may be responsible for or may have produced the record; (iii) the date of the record or the date or
period to which it refers or relates; (iv) the type of record such as an application, a grant, a contract, or a report;
(v) personnel of the Corporation who may have prepared or have knowledge of the record; and (vi) citations to newspapers
or publications which have referred to the record.
(3) The Corporation is not required to create a record or to seek to acquire a record from its contractors in order to
satisfy a request.
(4) All requests for records under this section shall be made in writing, with the envelope and the letter clearly marked:
``Freedom of Information Request.'' All such requests shall be addressed to the Freedom of Information Officer,
2 Democracy Center, 6903 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817. Any request not marked and addressed as specified in
this paragraph will be so marked by Corporation personnel as soon as it is properly identified, and forwarded immediately
to the Freedom of Information Officer. A request improperly addressed will not be deemed to have been received for
purposes of the time period set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until forwarding to the appropriate office has
been effected. On receipt of an improperly addressed request, the Freedom of Information Officer shall notify the
requester of the date on which the time period commenced to run. 
(5) A person desiring to secure copies of records by mail should write to the Freedom of Information Officer, 2 Democracy
Center, 6903 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, Maryland 20817. The request must identify the records of which copies are
sought in accordance with the requirements of this section, and the number of copies desired. Fees may be required
to be paid in advance in accordance with  1102.10. The requester will be advised of the estimated fee, if any,
as promptly as possible. If a waiver or reduction of fees is requested, the grounds for such request should be included
in the letter.
(c) The Freedom of Information Officer, upon receipt of a request for any records made in accordance with this section,
shall make an initial determination of whether to comply with or deny such request and dispatch such determination
to the requester within 10 working days after receipt of such request, except for unusual circumstances in which case
the time limit may be extended for not more than 10 working days by written notice to the requester setting forth the
reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. In determining whether
to issue a notice of extension of time for a response to a request beyond the 10-day period, the Freedom of Information
Officer shall consult with the Office of the General Counsel. As used herein, ``unusual circumstances'' are limited
to the following, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from the Corporation's field offices;
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records
which are demanded in a single request; or 
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, including consultation with
another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among components of the Corporation
having substantial subject matter interest therein. 
(d) If no determination has been dispatched at the end of the 10-day period, or the last extension thereof, the requester
may deem the request denied, and exercise a right of appeal in accordance with  1102.9. When no determination
can be dispatched within the applicable time limit, the Freedom of Information Officer shall nevertheless continue
to process the request. On expiration of the time limit, the Freedom of Information Officer shall inform the requester
of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a determination may be expected to be dispatched, and of the right to
treat the delay as a denial and to appeal to the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer (``CEO'') in accordance with
 1102.9. The Freedom of Information Officer may ask the requester to forego appeal until a determination is
made.
(e) After it has been determined to comply with a request, the Corporation will act with diligence in providing a substantive
response to the requester.


 1102.6

Exemptions.


(a) 5 U.S.C. 552 exempts from all of its publication and disclosure requirements matters falling within nine categories,
which are described in paragraph (b) of that section.
(b) Specifically, the exemptions of 5 U.S.C. 552(b) will be applied to matters that are:

(1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest
of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive Order;

(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552b), provided that such statute (i) requires
that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes
particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld, including sections
148 and 1314 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2168, 2297b-13), the latter of which authorizes
the Corporation to ``protect trade secrets and commercial or financial information to the same extent as a privately
owned corporation'';

(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an
agency in litigation with the Corporation;

(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy;

(7) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such
records could reasonably be expected to (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right
to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (iv)
disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority
in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation,
confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and
procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure would risk circumvention
of the law, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;

(8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use
of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

(c) In the event that one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (b) applies, any reasonably segregable portion of a
record shall be provided to the requester after deletion of the portions that are exempt. In appropriate circumstances,
subject to the discretion of Corporation officials, it may be possible to provide a requester with:

(1) A summary of information in the exempt portion of a record; or

(2) An oral description of the exempt portion of a record.

(d) In determining whether any of the foregoing techniques, cited in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2), should be employed
or whether an exemption should be waived in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section, Corporation officials
shall consult with the Office of General Counsel. No requester shall have a right to insist that any or all of the foregoing
techniques should be employed in order to satisfy a request.

(e) Records that may be exempted from disclosure pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section may be made available as
a matter of discretion when disclosure is not prohibited by law, if it does not appear adverse to legitimate interests
of the Corporation, the public, or any person.



 1102.7 

Officials authorized to grant or deny requests for records.



The General Counsel shall furnish necessary advice to Corporation officials and staff as to their obligations under
this part and shall take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to assure a consistent and equitable
application of the provisions of this part by and within the Corporation. The Freedom of Information Officer, with
concurrence from the appropriate program officials of the Corporation, is authorized to grant or deny requests under
this part. The Freedom of Information Officer shall consult with the General Counsel before denying requests under
this part, or before granting requests for waiver or modified application of an exemption or for categories of records
which the General Counsel determines may present special or unusual problems.



 1102.8 

Denials.



(a) A denial of a written request for a record that complies with the requirements of  1102.5 shall be in writing
and shall include the following:

(1) A reference to the applicable exemption or exemptions in  1102.6(b) upon which the denial is based;

(2) An explanation of how the exemption applies to the requested records;

(3) A statement explaining whether there is any segregable nonexempt material of the record after deleting the exempt
portions;

(4) The name and title of the person or persons responsible for denying the request; and

(5) An explanation of the right to appeal the denial and of the procedures for submitting an appeal, including the address
of the official to whom appeals should be submitted.

(6) Whenever the Corporation makes a record available subject to the deletion of a portion of the record, such action
shall be deemed a denial of a record for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.



 1102.9



Appeals of denials.



(a) Any person whose written request has been denied is entitled to appeal the denial within thirty calendar days of
issuance thereof by writing to the CEO of the Corporation at its headquarters. The envelope and letter should be clearly
marked: ``Freedom of Information Appeal.'' An appeal need not be in any particular form, but should adequately identify
the denial, if possible, by describing the requested record, identifying the official who issued the denial, and
providing the date on which the denial was issued.

(b) No personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing will ordinarily be permitted on appeal of a denial. Upon request
and a showing of special circumstances, however, this limitation may be waived and an informal conference may be arranged
with the Corporation CEO, or the CEO's designated representative, for this purpose.

(c) The appeal decision of the CEO, or the CEO's designated representative, shall be in writing and, in the event the
denial is in whole or in part upheld, shall contain an explanation responsive to the arguments advanced by the requester,
the matters described in  1102.8(a) (1) through (4), and the provisions for judicial review of such decision
under section 552(a)(4) of the FOIA. The appeal decision shall be dispatched to the requester within twenty working
days after receipt of the appeal, unless an additional period is justified pursuant to  1102.5(c). The appeal
decision shall constitute the final action of the Corporation. All such decisions shall be treated as final opinions
under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2).



 1102.10



Fees.



(a) Records provided routinely in the normal course of doing business will be provided at no charge.

(b) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records
are for a commercial use request;

(c) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for duplication when records are not sought through a commercial
use request and the request is made by an educational institution or non-commercial scientific institution, whose
purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media; and 

(d) For any request not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard
charges for search, review and duplication.

(e) The schedule of charges for services regarding the production or disclosure of the Corporation's records is as
follows: 

(1) Whenever feasible, for manual searches and reviews: The basic rate(s) of pay of the employee(s) making the search
and review plus 16 percent of the rate(s) to cover benefits.

(2) Computer time: Because of the diversity in the types of configurations of computers which may be required in responding
to requests for records maintained in whole or part in computerized form, it is not feasible to establish a uniform
schedule of fees for search and printout of such records. The charge for personnel time shall be the basic rate(s) of
pay of the employee(s) involved plus 16 percent of the rate(s) to cover benefits. The charge for the computer time involved
and for any special supplies or materials used shall not exceed the direct cost to the Corporation.

(3) Duplication of records: A per-page charge for paper copy reproduction of documents. At present, the charge is
$0.10 per page.

(4) Duplication of microform: Actual charges as incurred.

(5) Certification of true copies: $1.00 each.

(6) Packing and mailing records: Actual charges as incurred.

(7) Special delivery or express mail: Actual charges as incurred.
(f) A record shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under paragraph
(e) of this section if disclosure of the record is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly
to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest
of the requester.

(1) In order to determine whether disclosure of the record ``is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government,'' the Corporation will
consider the following four criteria:

(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns ``the operations or activities
of the government'';

(ii) The informative value of the record to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an
understanding of government operations or activities;

(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure:
Whether disclosure of the requested record will contribute to ``public understanding''; and 

(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute
``significantly'' to public understanding of government operations or activities.

(2) In order to determine whether disclosure of a record ``is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester,''
the Corporation will consider the following two factors:

(i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would
be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,

(ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester
is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is ``primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.''

(3) A denial of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees will be subject to appeal in the same manner as appeals from
denial of a request for information under  1102.9.

<PARENT> FR940527-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(g) No fee will be charged under this section_

(1) If the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee; or

(2) For any request described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section for the first two hours of search time and
for the first one hundred pages of duplication.

(h) No requester will be required to make an advance payment of any fee unless the requester has previously failed to
pay fees in a timely fashion or the Corporation has determined that the fee will exceed $250.

(1) In the event that a requester has previously failed to pay a required fee (within 30 days of the date of billing),
an advance deposit of the full amount of the anticipated fee together with the fee then due plus interest accrued may
be required. The request will not be deemed to have been received by the Corporation until such payment is made.

(2) In the event that the Corporation determines that an estimated fee will exceed $250, the requester shall be notified
of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. Such notification shall be
transmitted as soon as possible, but in any event within five working days of such determination, giving the best estimate
then available. The notification shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with appropriate representatives
of the Corporation for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a reduced cost.
The request will not be deemed to have been received by the Corporation until an advance payment of the entire fee is
made.

(i) Interest will be charged to those requesters who fail to pay the fees charged. Interest will be assessed on the amount
billed, starting on the 31st calendar day following the day on which the billing was sent. The rate charged will be as
prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

(j) If the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to break a request
into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation shall aggregate such requests
and charge accordingly.

(k) The Corporation reserves the right to limit the number of copies that will be provided of any record to a requester
or to require that special arrangements for duplication be made in the case of bound volumes or other records representing
unusual problems of handling or duplication.



 1102.11 

Notice to submitters of certain information.



(a) Upon receipt of a request for information that either, (1) the Freedom of Information Officer determines may be
exempt from disclosure under paragraph (b)(4) of  1102.6 as privileged or confidential trade secrets or commercial
or financial information submitted to the Corporation by a third party or entity (other than federal government agencies);
or (2) is subject to an understanding of confidentiality between the Corporation and the submitter thereof, the Freedom
of Information Officer shall provide the submitter of such information with notice of the request.

(b) The Corporation shall afford a submitter of information covered by paragraph (a) of this section a period, generally
not in excess of 10 working days, within which to provide the Freedom of Information Officer a detailed statement of
objections to the disclosure of such information by the Corporation. The submitter's response (if any) shall include
all bases, factual or legal, for the withholding of the requested information pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of  1102.6.
If the Freedom of Information Officer does not receive a timely response from the submitter, the Freedom of Information
Officer shall proceed with the determination of whether or not to release such information.

(c) Whenever the Corporation decides to release any part of the information covered by paragraph (a) of this section
over the objection of the submitter, the Corporation shall forward to the submitter a written statement providing
a brief explanation why the Corporation did not agree with the submitter's objections; a description of the information
to be released; and the expected date of the release.

(d) If a requester or submitter brings suit against the Corporation seeking to compel or restrict the release of information
covered by paragraph (a) of this section, the Corporation shall promptly notify the other party.

(e) The notice requirement of this section shall not apply if:

(1) The information has been published or otherwise made available to the public;

(2) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552);

(3) The submitter has received notice of a previous FOIA request which encompassed the information requested in the
later request, and the Corporation intends to withhold information in the same manner as in the previous FOIA request;
or 

(4) Upon submitting the information or within a reasonable period thereafter, (i) the submitter reviewed its information
in anticipation of future requests pursuant to the FOIA, (ii) the submitter provided the Corporation a statement
of its objections to disclosure consistent with that described in paragraph (b) of this section, and (iii) the Corporation
intends to release information consistent with the submitter's objections.

Airworthiness Directives: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries MU-2B Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that applies to certain Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries MU-2B series airplanes. This action 
requires adjusting the engine underspeed governor 
minimum stop (ground idle) and the airframe condition 
control linkage, modifying the tachometer indicator 
markings, fabricating and installing a placard that 
specifies a minimum idle speed, and incorporating 
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revisions. An accident of 
one of the affected airplanes where the propeller hub 
assembly failed and the propeller separated from the 
airplane prompted this action. Accident investigation 
analysis indicates a reduction in fatigue strength of 
the propeller hub because of high vibration frequencies 
during ground idle speed. The actions specified by 
this AD are intended to prevent propeller hub arm 
assembly failure because of high vibration frequencies 
during ground idle speed and possible separation of the 
propeller from the airplane, which could result in loss 
of control of the airplane. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A recent accident of a 
Mitsubishi Model MU-2B-60 airplane where the propeller 
hub assembly failed and the propeller separated from 
the airplane prompted the FAA and the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to investigate the 
vibration frequency of these airplanes during ground 
idle operation. Accident investigation analysis 
indicates a reduction in fatigue strength of the 
propeller hub because of high vibration frequencies 
during ground idle speed. These high vibration 
frequencies, if not corrected, eventually will result 
in the above-referenced propeller hub assembly failure 
and separation of the propeller from the airplane. 




After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
all available information related to the incidents 
described above, the FAA has determined that (1) 
certain precautions (in addition to those taken by 
previous AD actions and during initial certification of 
the airplane) should be taken to minimize these high 
vibration frequencies during ground idle speed; and (2) 
AD action should be taken to prevent the 
above-referenced conditions. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
is likely to exist or develop in other Mitsubishi MU-2B 
series airplanes of the same type design, this AD 
requires adjusting the engine underspeed governor 
minimum stop (ground idle) and the airframe condition 
control linkage, modifying the tachometer indicator 
markings, fabricating and installing a placard that 
specifies a minimum idle speed, and incorporating 
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revisions. The ground 
idle modification is required to be accomplished in 
accordance with the Allied Signal Garrett Maintenance 
Manual (Report No. 72-00-95 for TPE331-10-501M or 
Report No. 72-00-27 for TPE331-501M or -511M), chapter 
72-00-00, General-Adjustment/Test; and chapter 76-10- 
01, Control Linkage Assembly, Maintenance Practices. 
The airframe control linkage modification is required to be accomplished in 
accordance with chapter 6,  9.2, of the 
applicable Mitsubishi MU-2 maintenance manual. The 
revisions to the applicable Airplane Flight Manual are 
as follows:

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for public prior comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 



Comments Invited 



Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting immediate flight safety and,
thus, was not preceded by notice and opportunity to comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications
received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments
received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating
the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-09-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket.

Amendment 39-8920; Docket No. 94-CE-09-AD. 






Applicability:

 The following model and serial number 
airplanes, certificated in any category: 








Compliance:

 Required within the next 25 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless 
already accomplished. 

To prevent propeller hub arm assembly failure 
because of high vibration frequencies during ground 
idle speed and possible separation of the propeller 
from the airplane, which could result in loss of 
control of the airplane, accomplish the following: 

(a) Adjust the underspeed governor minimum stop 
(ground idle) to a range of 76.5 percent to 78.5 
percent in accordance with the Allied Signal Garrett 
Maintenance Manual (Report No. 72-00-95 for 
TPE331-10-501M or Report No. 72-00-27 for TPE331-501M 
or -511M), chapter 72-00-00, General-Adjustment /Test; 
and chapter 76-10-01, Control Linkage Assembly, 
Maintenance Practices. 






Note 1:

 One clockwise turn of the adjusting screw 
will increase the ground idle engine speed 
approximately 5 percent. 




(b) Modify the airframe condition control linkage 
by adjusting Rod 1 and Levers 2 and 7 as specified in 
Figure 1 of this AD in accordance with Chapter 6, 
 9.2, of the applicable Mitsubishi MU-2 
maintenance manual.

(c) Modify the tachometer indicator marking by 
accomplishing the following: 

(1) Apply red lacquer (Federal Standard 595a, 
number 11105 or equivalent) to the tachometer indicator 
glass so that the red operating arc extends to 76.5 
percent.

 




Note 2: 

The red operating arc range will now be 
from 50 percent to 76.5 percent.

 


(2) Using white lacquer (MIL-L-7178, color number 
511 or equivalent), apply a 1/16-inch wide by 1/4-inch 
long slip stripe over the tachometer glass and 
indicator case at the 11:30 o'clock position as 
specified in Figure 2 of this AD.

Establishment of Class E Airspace Areas



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action establishes Class E airspace areas at Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan
Airport, CA, Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue Airport, HI, San Jose International
Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows
Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View, Moffett Field NAS, CA. Presently, these areas are designated as Class D airspace
when the associated control tower is in operation. However, controlled airspace to the surface is needed when the
control towers located at these areas are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E
airspace for instrument flight rule (IFR) operations when these control towers are closed. This action also revises
the Class E4 airspace area at Point Mugu NAWS, CA, to indicate that this airspace area, as an extension to the Pt. Mugu
part-time Class D airspace area, is part-time. This action also revises the Class E4 airspace areas at Hilo International,
General Lyman Field, HI, and Lihue Airport, HI, to show that these airspace areas are full-time and revises the Class
E3 airspace area at Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA to show that it is full time. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



Request for Comments on the Rule 



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the 

DATES

 section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation. 

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful
in evaluating the effects of the rule. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical,
economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.




The Rule 



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) establishes Class E airspace areas at
Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan Airport, CA, Hilo International, General
Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue Airport, HI, San Jose International Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix
Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View,
Moffett Field NAS, CA. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated control tower is in operation.
Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Edwards AFB, CA, LeMoore NAS (Reeves
Field), CA, Stockton Metropolitan Airport, CA, Hilo International, General Lyman Field, HI, Kaneohe MCAS, HI, Lihue
Airport, HI, San Jose International Airport, CA, El Toro MCAS, CA, Phoenix Luke AFB, AZ, Santa Barbara Municipal Airport,
CA, Tuscon-Ryan Field, AZ, Crows Landing NALF, CA, and Mountain View, Moffett Field NAS, CA, when the control towers
are closed. The intended effect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at these airports
when these control towers are closed.

This action also revises the Class E4 airspace area at Point Mugu NAWS, CA, to show it as part-time airspace associated
with the Pt. Mugu part-time Class D airspace area, the Class E4 airspace area at Hilo International, General Lyman
Field, HI, and Lihue Airport, HI, to indicate the full-time status, and the Class E3 airspace area at Santa Barbara
Municipal Airport, CA, to show is full time status.

As noted in the Airspace Reclassification Final Rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 17, 1991, airspace at an airport with a part-time control tower should be designated as a Class D airspace
area when the control tower is in operation, and as a Class E airspace area when the control tower is closed (56 FR 65645).

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports, extensions to a Class C surface area and extensions to a Class D surface area are published,
respectively, in Paragraphs 6002, 6003 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote the safe and efficient
handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are
impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action amends the Walla Walla, Washington, Class D airspace from full-time to part-time. It will correct that
part of the airspace description which was inadvertently omitted during the airspace reclassification process.
Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic
area'' and ``control zones'' with operating control towers, replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace.''
This amendment brings publications up-to-date giving continuous information to the aviation public.

History



On March 21, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the
Walla Walla, Washington, airspace designation (59 FR 13262). Interested parties were invited to participate in
the rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal. No comments were received.

During the airspace reclassification process (57 FR 38962; August 27, 1992) the language designating the Class D
airspace as part time was inadvertently omitted. This action corrects that omission. Airspace reclassification,
in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone''
with operating control towers, and replaced them with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' The coordinates for
this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order
7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58
FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in
the Order.



The Rule



The amendment to part 71 of Federal Aviation Regulations amends Class D airspace at Walla Walla, Washington. The FAA
has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent
and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Final rule; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies the Class D airspace areas at Prescott, Ernest A. Love Field, AZ, Alameda NAS (Nimitz Field),
CA, Bakersfield, Meadows Field, CA, Lancaster, Gen. William J. Fox Airfield, CA, Sacramento Executive Airport,
CA, Salinas Municipal Airport, CA, Barbers Point NAS, HI, Fallon NAS (Van Voorhis Field), NV, Point Mugu NAWS, CA,
and El Centro NAF, CA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide with the associated control tower's hours
of operation. This action also established Class E airspace at these area when the associated control tower is closed.
The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these airport traffic control
towers is required and to provide Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are
closed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments on the Rule



Although this action is a final rule, and was not preceded by notice and public procedure, comments are invited on the
rule. This rule will become effective on the date specified in the DATES 

section. However, after the review of any comments, and if the FAA finds that further changes are appropriate, it will
initiate rulemaking proceedings to extend the effective date of the rule or amend the regulation. Comments that provide
the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in evaluating the effects
of the rule. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental,
and energy-related aspects of the rule which might suggest the need to modify the rule.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) modifies the Class D airspace at Prescott,
Ernest A. Love Field, AZ, Alameda NAS (Nimitz Field), CA, Bakersfield, Meadows Field, CA, Lancaster, Gen. William
J. Fox Airfield, CA, Sacramento Executive Airport, CA, Salinas Municipal Airport, CA, Barbers Point NAS, HI, Fallon
NAS (Van Voorhis Field), NV, Point Mugu NAWS, CA, and El Centro NAF, CA, by amending the areas' effective hours to coincide
with the associated control tower's hours of operation. This action also establishes Class E airspace at these areas
when the associated control tower is closed. Prior to Airspace Reclassification, an airport traffic area (ATA) and
a control zone (CZ) existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification, effective September 16, 1993,
discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zone,'' replacing them with the designation
``Class D airspace.'' The former CZ was continuous, while the former ATA was contingent upon the operation of the airport
traffic control tower. The consolidation of the ATA and CZ into a single D airspace designation makes it necessary
to modify the effective hours of the Class D airspace to coincide with the control tower's hours of operation. This
action also establishes Class E airspace during the hours the control tower is closed. The intended effect of the action
is to clarify when two-way radio communication with these airport traffic control towers is required and to provide
adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when these control towers are closed.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D and E airspace designations
are published in Paragraphs 5000 and 6002, respectively, of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and E airspace designations
listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes
that there is an immediate need to modify these Class D and establish these Class E airspace areas in order to promote
the safe and efficient handling of air traffic in these areas. Therefore, I find that notice and public procedures
under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

IFR Altitudes; Miscellaneous Amendments


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment adopts miscellaneous amendments to the required IFR (instrument flight rules) altitudes and changeover
points for certain Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes for which a minimum or maximum en route authorized
IFR altitude is prescribed. This regulatory action is needed because of changes occurring in the National Airspace
System. These changes are designed to provide for the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace under instrument
conditions in the affected areas.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 95 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 95) amends, suspends, or revokes IFR altitudes
governing the operation of all aircraft in flight over a specified route or any portion of that route, as well as the
changeover points (COPs) for Federal airways, jet routes, or direct routes as prescribed in part 95. The specified
IFR altitudes, when used in conjunction with the prescribed changeover points for those routes, ensure navigation
aid coverage that is adequate for safe flight operations and that is free of frequency interference. The reasons and
circumstances that create the need for this amendment involve matters of flight safety and operational efficiency
in the National Airspace System, are related to aeronautical charts that are essential to the user, and provide for
the safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. In addition, those various reasons or circumstances require
making this amendment effective before the next scheduled charting and publication date of the flight information
to assure its timely availability to the user. The effective date of this amendment reflects those considerations.
In view of the close and immediate relationship between these regulatory changes and safety in air commerce, I find
that notice and public procedure before adopting this amendment are impracticable and contrary to the public interest
and that good cause exists for making the amendment effective in less than 30 days.


The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(A), 1 CFR part 51, and  97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.




The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification, and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been canceled.

The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

ACTION:

 Temporary regulations.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 These temporary regulations are being issued to provide guidance to the public with respect to the substantiation
requirement contained in section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 170(f)(8) was added to the Code
by section 13172 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The guidance contained in these regulations affects
donors of charitable contributions of $250 or more.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act 



These regulations are being issued without prior notice and public procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For this reason, the collection of information contained in these regulations has been reviewed
and, pending receipt and evaluation of public comments, approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under
control number 1545-1431. 

For further information concerning this collection of information, and where to submit comments on this collection
of information, the accuracy of the estimated burden, and suggestions for reducing this burden, please refer to the
preamble in the cross-reference notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Proposed Rules section of this issue
of the 

Federal Register

. 



Background 



This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to the substantiation requirement
for the deduction of certain charitable contributions under section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).
Section 170(f)(8) was added by section 13172 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 



Need for Temporary Regulations 



The provisions contained in this Treasury decision are needed immediately to provide guidance to the public with
respect to the application of the substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8). Therefore, it is found impracticable
and contrary to the public interest to issue this Treasury decision with prior notice under section 553(b) of title
5 of the United States Code. 



Explanation of Provisions 



Section 170 allows a deduction for contributions to or for the use of certain specified organizations, including
those organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes.


To be deductible under section 170 of the Code, a payment to or for the use of a qualified organization must be a gift_that
is, a payment of money or transfer of property without adequate consideration. Rev. Rul. 67-246, 1967-2
C.B. 104. Thus, if a taxpayer receives goods or services from the organization in consideration for a payment, the
taxpayer may not deduct as a charitable contribution more than the excess of the amount paid over the value of the consideration
received therefor. Id. The Service has determined, however, that if a taxpayer receives only certain inconsequential
or insubstantial benefits in consideration for a payment to a qualified organization, the taxpayer may deduct the
entire payment as a charitable contribution. Rev. Proc. 90-12, 1990-1 C.B. 471. See also Rev. Proc. 92-49,
1992-1 C.B. 987 (amplifying Rev. Proc. 90-12 by providing that certain free, unordered, low-cost items
that accompany charitable solicitations are considered to have insubstantial value). (See  601.601(d)(2)(ii)
of the Statement of Procedural Rules, 26 CFR part 601.) 

Section 170(f)(8) disallows a deduction for any contribution of $250 or more that is not substantiated by a written
acknowledgment from the donee organization. The acknowledgment must provide information regarding (a) the money
or other property contributed, and (b) any goods or services provided by the donee organization in whole or partial
consideration for the contributed money or other property. 

Section 170(f)(8) is a compliance provision, intended to facilitate the enforcement of the substantive requirements
for a deduction under section 170. The compliance purpose of section 170(f)(8) does not require that an acknowledgment
refer to goods or services provided by a donee organization to a donor if the provision of goods or services does not
affect the amount that the donor is entitled to deduct as a charitable contribution. Therefore, the temporary regulations
provide that goods or services given in return for a contribution need not be taken into account for purposes of section
170(f)(8), if the goods or services have insubstantial value under the guidelines provided in Rev. Procs. 90-12
and 92-49 (and any successor documents). (See  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules,
26 CFR part 601.) 

The legislative history of the 1993 Act states that Congress intended a similar exception to apply in connection with
the disclosure requirement of section 6115. See H. Rep. No. 213, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 566 (1993). Although the legislative
history does not discuss application of such an exception to the substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8),
the Service has determined that such an exception is equally appropriate. 

Some donee organizations receive contributions through arrangements in which employers withhold amounts from
the wages of their employees in accordance with pledges made by the employees, and pay the withheld amounts to the donee
organizations. Donee organizations that use these arrangements may not know the identity of the contributing employees
or the amounts contributed by each employee. Therefore, these donee organizations may face difficulty in preparing
the acknowledgments contemplated by section 170(f)(8). 

The statutory language and legislative history of section 170(f)(8) suggest that Congress appreciated the difficulties
of applying the substantiation requirement to contributions made by payroll deduction and intended that these difficulties
be addressed by regulations. Section 170(f)(8)(E) directs the Secretary to ``provide such regulations as may be
necessary or appropriate'' to carry out the purposes of section 170(f)(8), ``including regulations that may provide
that some or all of the requirements of [that section] do not apply in appropriate cases.'' The Conference Report on
the 1993 Act expresses the conferees' intent that the Secretary exercise his regulatory authority ``to clarify the
treatment of contributions made through payroll deductions.'' H. Rep. No. 213, supra, at 567. 

Accordingly, the temporary regulations also provide special rules for contributions made by payroll deduction.
The special rules allow taxpayers to substantiate contributions made by payroll deduction by a combination of two
documents: (a) a document furnished by the taxpayer's employer that evidences the amount withheld from the taxpayer's
wages, and (b) a document prepared by the donee organization that states that the organization does not provide goods
or services as whole or partial consideration for any contributions made by payroll deduction.

The special rules for contributions made by payroll deduction, like the underlying statutory provisions, do not
require that the document prepared by the donee organization take any particular form. Similarly, although donors
must obtain the document in time to meet the ``contemporaneous'' requirement of the statute (generally, by the time
they file the relevant tax return), the rules do not require the donee organization to prepare the document at any particular
time. Therefore, if a donee organization includes the statement contemplated by the rules on a pledge card prepared
to solicit contributions in 1995, a donor who receives the card before timely filing the donor's 1994 tax return could
use the card to substantiate contributions made in 1994. Contributions made by payroll deduction during 1994 can
thus be substantiated under these rules even if the donee organization has used pledge cards for 1994 contributions
that do not include the statement contemplated by the rules. As a result, the Service understands that donee organizations
will be able to comply with the ``contemporaneous'' requirement for 1994 contributions. The Service invites comments,
however, on whether transitional relief from the ``contemporaneous'' requirement is needed for 1994 contributions.


The temporary regulations also provide that, for purposes of applying the $250 threshold provided in section 170(f)(8)(A)
to contributions made by payroll deduction, the amount withheld from each paycheck is treated as a separate contribution.
Thus, the substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8) will not apply to contributions made by payroll deduction
unless the employer deducts $250 or more from a single paycheck for the purpose of payment to a donee organization.
This rule is consistent with the legislative history of section 170(f)(8). See H. Rep. No. 213, supra, at 565 n.29 (``In
cases of contributions paid by withholding from wages, the deduction from each paycheck will be treated as a separate
payment.''). 

Some charitable organizations solicit contributions in the form of payroll deductions or lump-sum payments for
the purpose of distributing the amounts received to other charitable organizations. The temporary regulations
provide that, in such cases, the distributing organization is treated as a donee organization for purposes of the
substantiation requirement of section 170(f)(8). This rule applies regardless of whether the distributing organization
distributes the contributed funds pursuant to the donor's instructions. The rule does not apply, however, if a distributee
organization provides goods or services to the donor as part of a transaction structured with a view to avoid taking
the goods or services into account in determining the amount of the deduction to which the donor is entitled under section
170. 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that these temporary regulations are not a significant regulatory action as defined in Executive
Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter
5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, an initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, these
regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment
on their impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these regulations is Joel S. Rutstein, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax &
Accounting), Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the Service and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

Substantiation requirement for certain contributions.



(a) 

Certain goods or services that have insubstantial value not taken into account. 

Goods or services that have insubstantial value under the guidelines provided in Revenue Procedures 90-12,
1990-1 C.B. 471, and 92-49, 1992-1 C.B. 987, (and any successor documents) need not be taken into
account for purposes of section 170(f)(8). (See  601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules,
26 CFR part 601.)

(b) 

Contributions made by payroll deduction

_(1) 

Form of substantiation. 

A contribution made by means of withholding from a taxpayer's wages and payment by the taxpayer's employer to a donee
organization may be substantiated, for purposes of section 170(f)(8), by_

(i) A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by the employer that evidences the amount withheld by the
employer for the purpose of payment to a donee organization, and

(ii) A pledge card or other document prepared by the donee organization that includes a statement that the organization
does not provide goods or services in whole or partial consideration for any contributions made to the organization
by payroll deduction.

(2) 

Application of $250 threshold. 

For the purpose of applying the $250 threshold provided in section 170(f)(8)(A) to contributions made by the means
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount withheld from each payment of wages to a taxpayer is treated
as a separate contribution.

(c) 

Distributing organizations as donees. 

An organization described in section 170(c), or an organization described in 5 CFR 950.105 (a Principal Combined
Fund Organization for purposes of the Combined Federal Campaign) and acting in that capacity, that receives a payment
made as a contribution is treated as a donee organization solely for purposes of section 170(f)(8), even if the organization
(pursuant to the donor's instructions or otherwise) distributes the amount received to one or more organizations
described in section 170(c). This paragraph (c) does not apply, however, to a case in which the distributee organization
provides goods or services as part of a transaction structured with a view to avoid taking the goods or services into
account in determining the amount of the deduction to which the donor is entitled under section 170.

(d) 

Effective date. 

The rules of this section apply to contributions made on or after January 1, 1994.

Special Local Regulation; Tallship Erie 94, Lake Erie, Presque Isle Bay, Erie, PA 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 A special local regulation is being adopted for the marine event, Tallship Erie 94. This event will be held on Presque
Isle Bay and Lake Erie, Erie, PA on July 8, 1994. The Tallship Erie 94 will have an estimated 15-20, 70-200
foot sailing ships, parading in a closed course on Lake Erie and will have an unusually large concentration of spectator
vessels which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life,
limb, and property on navigable waters during the event. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District until May 2, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to a publish proposed rule in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.



Drafting Information 



The drafters of this regulation is Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids
to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney,
Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office. 



Discussion of Regulation 



The Tallship Erie 94 will be held on Presque Isle Bay and Lake Erie on July 8, 1994. This regulation restricts general
navigation on Presque Isle Bay and Erie Harbor from the Perry's Landing to Erie Harbor Entrance Lighted Buoy 2 (LLNR
3520). This event will have an estimated 15-20, 70-200 foot sailing ships, parading in a closed course
on Lake Erie and will have an usually large concentration of spectator vessels which could pose hazards to navigation
in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection of life, limb, and property during this event. Any
vessel desiring to transit the regulated area may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Officer in
Charger, U.S. Cost Guard Station Erie, PA). 

This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165. 



Federalism Implications 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.




Economic Assessment and Certification



This regulatin is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportatin (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this regulation to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unecessary.



Collection of Information



This regulation will impose no collection information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

Safety Zone; Narragansett Bay, Quonset Point, RI


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary safety zone on June 4 and 5, 1994, at Quonset Point, North Kingstown, RI,
while aerial demonstrations are performed in preparation for and during the Rhode Island Air National Guard Open
House. This action is necessary to protect spectator and pleasure craft, as well as other vessels in the vicinity,
from the risks associated with low flying aircraft.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information


The drafters of this regulation were Lieutenant (junior grade) T. Pavilonis, Project Manager for the Coast Guard
Captain of the Port Providence, and Lieutenant Commander J. Stieb, Project Counsel for the First Coast Guard District
Legal Office.


Regulatory History


As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was not published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective less than 30 days after 

Federal Register

 publication. Due to the date on which this application was received, there was insufficient notice to publish proposed
rules in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest. The
air show is intended for public viewing and delaying the event would result in cancellation of the event due to the difficult
of rescheduling participants.


Background and Purpose


The purpose of this rulemaking is to protect spectators and pleasure craft, as well as other vessels, from potential
hazards associated with low level flight demonstrations. The demonstrations will take place in the airspace over
the Quonset State Airport, North Kingstown, RI, a portion of the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Davisville,
RI, and a small area of Narragansett Bay adjacent to the Quonset State Airport.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
The entities affected by this rulemaking effort are pleasure craft and fishing vessels. Large commercial vessel
transits through the waters contained in this safety zone are infrequent, approximately 3 per month. Commercial
fishing vessels are able to conduct operations outside the Quonset Channel because they are not constrained by their
draft. There are other areas available outside of the safety zone where normal fishing operations may be conducted.
Therefore, restricting access to the area as proposed will not cause undue hardship to any entity.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
For the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to
be minimal and the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

)


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and had determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.C
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are an action to protect public safety and are categorically excluded
from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.

Subsistence Management Regulations for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart C_Board Determinations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA; Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) has amended that portion of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska, subpart C, which lists the areas and communities, and residents thereof, determined to have
customary and traditional use of moose and rainbow trout on public lands (57 FR 22957-22964). Specifically,
Board decisions made on April 5, 1993 and August 10, 1993 have changed the customary and traditional use determinations
for rainbow trout in the Kuskokwim Area and for moose in Unit 1(B).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Rainbow Trout



In 1992, the communities of Quinhagak, Goodnews Bay, Kwethluk, Eek, Akiak, Akiachak, and Platinum requested that
the Board reconsider a negative customary and traditional use determination for rainbow trout. These communities
provided extensive testimony to the Board regarding their use of rainbow trout. In the summer and fall of 1992, staff
from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge and the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge conducted interviews in 19
communities within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to obtain additional information on customary and traditional uses
of rainbow trout. Based on public testimony, more current survey data, and contemporary Alaska Department of Fish
and Game subsistence use reports, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report (FWS report) on the subsistence uses of rainbow
trout was completed in April 1993, and entitled Customary and Traditional use Eligibility Report: Rainbow Trout,
Unit 18: Villages of Goodnews Bay, Platinum, Quinhagak, Eek, Kwethluk, Akiachak, and Akiak. Applying the eight factors
of customary and traditional use as specified at 36 CFR 242.16 and 50 CFR 100.16, this FWS report assessed the customary
and traditional uses employed by residents of these seven communities. The FWS report, which the Board used as support
for its ultimate decision, found that the communities of Goodnews Bay, Platinum, Quinhagak, Eek, Kwethluk, Akiachak,
and Akiak substantially met the requirements of the eight characteristics which exemplify customary and traditional
use of rainbow trout in the lower Kuskokwim River region. Therefore, the Board concluded that residents of those villages
have customarily and traditionally used rainbow trout for subsistence purposes.



Moose, Unit 1(B)



Concern for the health of the moose population in the Stikine River drainage of southeast Alaska prompted the Board
to take action in April 1993 to: (1) Limit subsistence uses of moose on public lands in the Stikine River drainage to
those qualified rural residents with a positive customary and traditional use determination for moose within the
Stikine River drainage, and (2) reduce pressure on that moose population by only authorizing subsistence harvest
of bulls with a spike-fork, or 50-inch antler configuration (or three brow tines on either antler). Federal customary
and traditional use determinations, which had been adopted in 1990 from State of Alaska regulations, only recognized
residents of Wrangell as having customary and traditional use of the moose population found in the Stikine River drainage.

<DOCNO> FR940527-0-00046 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After that April 1993 decision, the Board received numerous letters from individuals and organizations who objected
to the elimination of subsistence uses of moose by rural residents living outside of the Wrangell community. The Board
reconsidered this issue in an August 10, 1993 public meeting at which public testimony was taken and additional information
on customary and traditional uses of moose in the Stikine River drainage was reviewed. This additional information
included a transcript of a 1987 Alaska Board of Game hearing which established the original customary and traditional
use determination. The Board also examined information contained in State of Alaska and U.S. Forest Service studies
on subsistence use patterns in southeast Alaska.

In consideration of presented evidence, the Board determined that the quantity and quality of the new information
was substantially greater than was available when the original customary and traditional use determination was
made. The Board found compelling evidence that residents of Petersburg and perhaps other southeast Alaska communities
have a long-term pattern of use of, and strong economic and sociocultural dependence on, moose in the Stikine River
drainage. Accordingly, the Board amended the 1990 customary and traditional finding to that of an ``interim no determination''.
An ``interim no determination'' finding does not diminish Wrangell's customary and traditional use status but allows
all qualified rural residents to take moose in the Stikine River drainage pending completion of an ongoing Board review
of customary and traditional wildlife uses by southeastern Alaska communities.

The Board finds these modifications to be exempt from Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requirements for public
notice and public comments prior to publication. In this instance, the Board finds that such requirements are impracticable,
unnecessary, and contrary to public interest. The subpart C modifications contained herein accurately reflect
actions taken by the Board under full public review processes. Public notice and public comment opportunities on
these issues were afforded through newspaper notices, public meetings, and mailings. Further notice and public
comment on these modifications would impede the regulatory process, would provide insignificant benefits in nature
and impact, would unnecessarily restrict certain subsistence opportunities, and would generally fail to serve
overall public interest. Therefore, the Board has not reapplied notice and public comment procedures prior to publication
of these changes. 

The Board also finds good cause to implement this final rule on April 5, 1993 (for use of rainbow trout, Kuskokwim Area)
and on August 10, 1993 (for use of moose in Unit 1(B)). These effective dates are consistent with former Board actions
which were publicly deliberated and acted upon for this final rule modification. The Board therefore finds these
modifications to be exempt from APA requirements for publication 30 days prior to the effective date.

and Steubenville nonattainment areas. Ohio submitted supplemental material on December 4, 1991, and January 8,
1992. USEPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 3, 1993, at 58 FR 41218. Six letters were submitted
commenting on this proposal. Although several commenters requested delay of this final rulemaking, such delay is
impermissible under section 110(k) of the Act. USEPA has reviewed the submitted comments, and is taking final action
granting limited approval/limited disapproval as proposed, i.e. approving all regulations except for two paragraphs,
but determining that the plan does not fully satisfy requirements under Part D of Title I of the Act for the Cleveland
and Steubenville areas. If the relevant deficiencies are not remedied within 18 months, the first of the two sanctions
pursuant to section 179(b) of the Clean Air Act will take effect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background



Ohio submitted major revisions to its particulate matter regulations on November 14, 1991, with supplemental submittals
on December 4, 1991, and January 8, 1992. USEPA published notice of proposed rulemaking on August 3, 1993, at 58 FR 41218,
proposing limited approval of these submittals. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a history of requirements
and State submittals, a description of Ohio's submittal, a review of each submitted regulation, and reviews of whether
requirements in section 189 (including requirements for attainment demonstrations and reasonably available control
measures (RACM)) and elsewhere in the Clean Air Act are satisfied, concluding with a delineation of the proposed action.
For convenience, this section will provide highlights of relevant history and the next section will repeat the description
of the State submittal that was provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking. A third section will summarize the remainder
of the notice of proposed rulemaking, including the proposed action. A fourth section of today's notice will summarize
and review the public comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking. The final section of discussion in this notice
will describe the final action on the State's submittal.

Ohio submitted its original SIP for particulate matter on January 31, 1972, and submitted substantial revisions
on August 4, 1972. USEPA approved the plan and the revisions, most notably including several regulations in Chapter
AP-3 (Particulate Matter Standards), on April 15, 1974, at 39 FR 13539. Revisions to AP-3-04, submitted
on January 25, 1974, were approved on September 23, 1976, at 41 FR 41692. On August 10, 1976, Ohio submitted EP-12
(Open Burning), which USEPA approved on February 3, 1978, at 43 FR 4611.

Although the State provided various submittals between June 1980 and March 1985, and USEPA proposed rulemaking to
approve these revisions on January 2, 1987 (52 FR 91), these submittals were subsequently withdrawn and no Statewide
revisions were approved into the SIP. Thus, with the exception of a small number of source-specific limitations,
the previously approved Ohio SIP for particulate matter reflects the rules approved in 1974 and 1976, i.e. the 1972
version of the rules now codified in Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Chapter 3745-17 (Particulate Matter Standards)
and the 1976 version of the rules now codified in OAC Chapter 3745-19 (Open Burning Standards).

On July 1, 1987, USEPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter, refocussing
the standard on smaller particles. Pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,
 Cuyahoga County and the Steubenville area (including portions of Jefferson County, Ohio, and Brooke County, West
Virginia) were designated nonattainment for this revised standard, and the State was required to submit plan revisions
to assure attainment, require RACM, and satisfy other requirements for these two areas.





II. Description of Ohio's Submittal



The State's submittal of November 14, 1991, as supplemented December 4, 1991, and January 8, 1992, consisted of two
principal elements: (1) Statewide regulations, and (2) additional regulations, emissions, and modeling information
for Cuyahoga County and the Steubenville area. The Statewide regulations, submitted pursuant to Section 110, reflect
substantial revisions to the 1974 regulations presently in the SIP, and constitute the regulations that are presently
maintaining the air quality standards in much of the State. The materials relating to the Cuyahoga County and Steubenville
nonattainment areas were submitted pursuant to Part D of Title I of the Act, and include the more stringent regulations
that Ohio identified as needed to attain the standards in these areas.

The regulations submitted by Ohio include all of the rules in OAC Chapter 3745-17 except Rule 3745-17-05
(``Nondegradation policy'') and all rules in OAC Chapter 3745-75. (Rule 3745-17-06 contains no
language and is reserved.) The specific submitted rules in Chapter 3745-17 (Particulate Matter Standards)
and associated titles are as follows:




Rule 3745-17-01_Definitions
Rule 3745-17-02_Ambient air quality standards
Rule 3745-17-03_Measurement methods and procedures
Rule 3745-17-04_Compliance time schedules

Rule 3745-75-04_Monitoring requirements 
Rule 3745-75-05_Recordkeeping 
Rule 3745-75-06_Certification and compliance time schedules

 


Rules 3745-17-01 through 3745-17-11 and Rules 3745-75-01 through 3745-75-06
apply Statewide. Rule 3745-17-12 applies only to selected sources in Cuyahoga County. Rule 3745-17-13
applies only to selected sources in Jefferson County. Rule 3745-17-14 applies only to identified sources
in Cuyahoga and Jefferson Counties. 


A second group of elements of Ohio's submittal is the documentation of the State's demonstration that the regulations
provide for attainment in Cuyahoga County and in the Steubenville area, including a comprehensive emissions inventory
and documentation of a dispersion modeling analysis. A third group of elements in Ohio's submittal is administrative
and regulatory material, principally to demonstrate the adequacy of the State's rule adoption process. 




III. Summary of Review in Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 




The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a regulation-by-regulation review of the State's submittal. Since the
public comments did not question the review of most of these regulations, this review is not repeated here. The test
method for measuring solids in quench water, given in Rule 3745-17-03(B)(10)(c), was found not approvable
because the provision for monthly averaging provides insufficient limitation on 24 hour average emissions levels
and allows noncompliance with the limit for a majority of the time. The quench water limit in Rule 3745-17-12(P)(6)(a)
was found not approvable simply because it is inseparable from the unapprovable test method in Rule 3745-17-03(B)(10)(c).
Otherwise, the conclusion of this review was that all regulations are approvable. 


The stack opacity provisions of Rule 3745-17-07(A) contain several provisions allowing sources to claim
exemptions from the applicable opacity limitation due to factors such as malfunction, startups, shutdowns, soot
blowing, and ash pulling. Generally, under the CAA and U.S. EPA policy, sources are required to meet, without interruption,
all applicable emission limitations and other control requirements. For an exemption from such requirement of continuous
compliance to be justified, the source must prove that an exemption applies and that the violation could not have been
prevented. 


In accordance with these principles, USEPA has conducted a further evaluation of various aspects of the stack opacity
provisions of Rule 3745-17-07(A). This rule provides that stacks must generally exhibit 20 percent opacity
or less, except for one 6-minute period of up to 60 percent opacity. Exempted from these limitations are restricted
conditions of malfunctions, startups, shutdowns, soot blowing, and ash pulling. The rule authorizing the exemptions
is approvable so long as it is interpreted and applied consistently with the requirements of the CAA and U.S. EPA policy
regarding such exemptions. 


In the case of malfunctions, the exemption is not available unless the malfunction was unavoidable and unless the
source has notified the State of the claimed malfunction, demonstrated that it performed proper operation and maintenance,
and met various other conditions. USEPA policy requires such regulations to place the burden of proof on the source
to demonstrate that the conditions for applicability of the malfunction exemption are met, including: that the claimed
malfunction was caused by circumstances entirely beyond the control of the source; could not have been prevented
through installation of proper control equipment, or through proper operation and maintenance procedures; and
that any activity which is or should be planned, or can be foreseen and avoided, is not properly excused as a malfunction.
USEPA interprets Ohio's regulation to place this burden of proof appropriately on the source. In accordance with
USEPA policy, USEPA interprets Ohio's regulation to provide that the enforcement authority (Ohio EPA, USEPA, or
both) must then evaluate whether the exemption has in fact been demonstrated to apply. 


Similarly, in the case of startups and shutdowns, an exemption from the general opacity limit is available only until
flue gas temperature reaches 250 
 F or for a 3-hour period, depending on the control equipment in place. In cases where a source claims high opacity
values are to be exempted, USEPA interprets Ohio's rule to place the burden on the source to document, based on temperature
or operation records as appropriate, that the exemption applies. USEPA also interprets the exemption for soot blowing
and ash handling to apply only if the source can provide documentary evidence to demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the enforcement agency (Ohio EPA, USEPA, or both) that the exemption criteria are satisfied. 


USEPA is approving the rule containing above types of exemptions based specifically on these interpretations of
Ohio's rules, and with the understanding that the exemptions are to be strictly interpreted, as well as applied in
a method that is consistent with the prohibition of relaxation of existing control requirements in section 193 of
the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7515. For further guidance on interpretation of exemptions see 42 FR 21472 (April 27, 1977). 


Additionally, with regard to the above exemptions, U.S. EPA will treat the submission of any incomplete or erroneous
information by a source as a violation of this regulation, and will not allow an exemption supported by such information.
U.S. EPA's action does not constitute advance approval of any exemptions which may be claimed or issued under Ohio's
regulations. Thus, U.S. EPA may take independent enforcement action to the extent allowed by sections 113 and any
other applicable provisions of the CAA, notwithstanding the issuance of an exemption by the State. 


The fourth section of the notice of proposed rulemaking provided a review of whether the submittal satisfied the requirements
of section 189. These requirements apply to plans for particulate matter nonattainment areas, which in Ohio include
Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County in and near Steubenville. Section 189(a)(1)(A) requires a suitable
new source review program, and is being addressed in a separate rulemaking. Section 189(a)(1)(B) requires a demonstration
that the plan will provide for attainment no later than December 31, 1994, or, alternatively, a demonstration that
attainment by this date is impracticable. Section 189(a)(1)(C) requires the implementation of RACM by December
10, 1993. Finally, Section 189(e) provides that ``control requirements * * * for major stationary
sources of PM-10 shall also apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors, except where the Administrator
determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the standard in the
area.'' 


The notice of proposed rulemaking provided a lengthy review of the attainment demonstrations for Cuyahoga County
and the Steubenville areas. This discussion included a detailed description of the limits and means of estimating
corresponding allowable emissions from stack sources, process fugitive sources, and open dust sources, as well
as the modeling procedures used to evaluate the air quality impacts of these emissions. Although the State used appropriate
estimates of emissions allowed under applicable limitations for most sources, the emissions estimates for a few
sources in the Steubenville area were found to significantly underestimate the emissions permitted by the applicable
regulations. The notice discussed emissions from Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's basic oxygen furnace (BOF) in particular
detail, as well as discussing coke oven emissions and condensible particulate matter. Most aspects of the dispersion
modeling analysis were found acceptable. However, the notice referenced various deficiencies in both the emissions
inventory and modeling analysis identified in the technical support documents for this rulemaking, including improper
selection of an allowable emissions rate for certain boilers, use of urban dispersion coefficients in modeling area
sources, and inadequate consideration of complex terrain. Based on a further modeling analysis, USEPA proposed
to find that the Cuyahoga County plan assures attainment, provided the State makes its quench water limit fully enforceable,
but that the Steubenville area plan does not assure attainment. 


The next element of the notice of proposed rulemaking concerned the requirement for RACM. In accordance with the ``General
Preamble,'' published April 16, 1992, at 57 FR 13498, USEPA believes this requirement can be satisfied without full
implementation of all potentially reasonably available control measures, provided attainment is assured by the
RACM deadline of December 10, 1993, and provided attainment could not be expedited by more rapid implementation of
measures. (See 57 FR 13543.) For most of Cuyahoga County, these provisos were found met, and the RACM requirement accordingly
satisfied. However, for Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant, certain measures necessary for attainment
were not required to be implemented until the end of 1994, nor did the State demonstrate that measures required by December
1993 represent the full set of reasonably available control measures. On the other hand, USEPA concluded that the
Steubenville area plan did require the full set of reasonably available control measures by December 1993.

The final element of the discussion of Section 189 requirements concerned provisions in Section 189(e) relating
to particulate matter precursors. The conclusion of this discussion was that such precursors do not contribute significantly
to particulate matter concentrations which exceed the standard in either area. 


A fifth section of the notice of proposed rulemaking evaluated whether Ohio's submittals satisfied other Clean Air
Act requirements. The principal relevant requirements beyond those of Section 189 are found in section 172(c). The
following table summarizes the requirements in each paragraph under section 172(c) and the conclusion in the notice
of proposed rulemaking as to whether each requirement is satisfied in each of the two nonattainment areas: 








Section 172(c)(6), which requires that limitations sufficient to provide for attainment be enforceable by the State
and USEPA, was found to be satisfied with respect to all but two paragraphs (relating to quench water quality) for Cuyahoga
County

2

 and was found not to be satisfied for the Steubenville area. 

The final element in the notice of proposed rulemaking was a delineation of the proposed rulemaking action. The action
proposed was limited approval. Specifically, USEPA proposed to approve all of the regulations except for the two
paragraphs noted above relating to quench water quality, i.e. paragraph (B)(10)(c) of Rule 3745-17-03
and paragraph (P)(6)(a) of Rule 3745-17-12. At the same time, USEPA proposed to approve these paragraphs
if the test method is revised to provide either a single day limit or weekly averaging of 5 days' samples. 


USEPA also proposed to find that the State's submittals satisfy several Part D requirements. Most notably, USEPA
proposed to find that the Cuyahoga County plan satisfied the requirement to assure attainment, provided that the
limitation on coke quench water quality is made properly enforceable, and proposed to find that the Steubenville
area plan satisfied the requirement for timely RACM. However, USEPA proposed to find that certain requirements of
Part D were not satisfied for these two areas. Most notably, USEPA proposed to find that the Cuyahoga County plan did
not satisfy the requirement for timely RACM, and proposed to find that the Steubenville area plan did not satisfy the
requirement for assuring attainment. The notice of proposed rulemaking indicated that the RACM requirement would
be satisfied in Cuyahoga County if attainment were assured by December 1993, which would be the case if the measures
currently required at Ford by December 1994 were to be required by December 1993 and the quench test method were revised.
Finally, USEPA proposed to determine that sources of particulate matter precursors do not presently contribute
significantly to violations of the particulate matter standard in Ohio. 



IV. Summary and Review of Comments 



Six letters were submitted commenting on this proposal, including letters from the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA), Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Company, Centerior Energy Corporation, the law firm Fuller & Henry
(representing a group of Ohio utilities), the law firm Porter, Wright, Morris & Arthur (representing Ford Motor
Corporation), and the law firm Squires, Sanders & Dempsey (representing several steel companies). The following
is a summary of each comment and USEPA's review of the comment: 



Comment: 

Several commenters requested that USEPA defer rulemaking on Ohio's submittal. These commenters noted that the rules
are under appeal to the State's Environmental Board of Review and that several revisions to these rules are anticipated
within the next few months. These commenters requested that USEPA wait for these anticipated rule revisions before
proceeding with rulemaking. 

One commenter provided a more detailed rationale for USEPA to defer rulemaking. First, given the commenter's presumption
that the Ohio rules will be changed in the near future, USEPA approval of the current rules would soon result in a situation
in which companies confront State rules that differ from USEPA-approved rules. Second, the commenter states that
USEPA cannot enforce a State rule which a State court has declared void ab initio. The commenter urges that USEPA defer
rulemaking to avoid this confusion as to enforceable requirements. 



Response:

 Section 110(k)(2) requires action on SIP submittals within 12 months of the date USEPA finds the submittal complete.
Since USEPA found this submittal complete on January 28, 1992, USEPA is long overdue for completing action on the State's
submittal, and no further delay is justified. 

USEPA cannot defer rulemaking on rules submitted by the State simply because the State may subsequently revise those
rules. Differences between State enforceable rules and federally enforceable rules also arise whenever USEPA disapproves
a State rule. In neither case does the potential for such differences constitute basis for USEPA action (or inaction),
and in both cases the set of rules approved by USEPA are fully federally enforceable. Regardless of the merits of the
commenter's statements for cases in which a State court has declared rules void, in this case no State court has declared
judgment on these rules and no evidence was provided that the rules do not remain in effect at the State level. USEPA
is acting on the rules as Ohio has submitted them for approval.

If the State does adopt and submit the anticipated rule revisions, USEPA intends to rulemake promptly on such submittal.
Some of the anticipated revisions are discussed below in the context of other comments. To the extent that these revisions
simply revisit issues already discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking and do not raise new issues, USEPA can
publish notice of final action on such revisions without another notice of proposed rulemaking. 



Comment:

 Several commenters found the visible emissions limitation on storage piles to be unreasonably strict. This limitation,
in Rule 3745-17-07(B)(6), permits no visible emissions from storage piles except for 13 minutes per hour.
These commenters noted the likelihood that continuous equipment operation would lead to continuous visible emissions,
and so the limit ``is impossible to achieve.'' One commenter presented a survey of visible emissions readings at storage
piles in which 21 of the 22 hours of readings exceeded the limit. This commenter also noted that every part of the Ohio
EPA data set used to support its rule development that was taken of vehicular traffic at a coal pile showed greater than
13 minutes per hour of visible emissions. This commenter was further concerned that Ohio apparently intended to apply
the above limitation to load-in operations, which the commenter believes should be given a separate opacity limit.
Another commenter also stated that it had taken readings which ``indicated that, 

with RACM in place

 (emphasis in original), the operations on [an observed storage pile] could not comply'' with the limit. 

A related concern regards the method used to evaluate visible emissions from storage piles. One commenter objected
that the question of whether Method 22 readings should be taken at a fixed point or a moving point depending on the movement
of a bulldozer is not addressed in any formal guidance and is based on ```guidance' consist[ing] primarily of a memo
written by John Summerhays'' of USEPA Region V. The commenter notes further that the ``Summerhays memo'' is inconsistent,
insofar as it recommends that visible emissions for roadways be read at a fixed point but for storage pile be read at
a variable location reflecting source relocation. Furthermore, the commenter believes that most of the material
that becomes airborne near a bulldozer promptly redeposits and should not be counted as visible emissions. For these
reasons, the commenter believes that the method is impracticable and unclear and should not be approved. In addition,
several other commenters indicated that Ohio's visible emissions limitation, as evaluated by this method, cannot
reasonably be achieved. 



Response:

 The commenters have provided evidence suggesting that Ohio's limit is difficult to meet. Nevertheless, USEPA believes
that this limitation is achievable. Ohio submittal included a study involving opacity readings at numerous storage
piles which was used to develop these limits. Although the commenters have provided supplemental data and reviewed
the subset of data from Ohio's study that was obtained at coal piles, the commenters have not provided a rationale for
concluding that coal piles are different from other types of storage piles or that the limits which Ohio's study shows
to be reasonable for storage piles in general are not reasonable for coal piles in particular. For example, the commenters
have not shown either that coal piles are more continuously worked or that coal pile operations are more prone to cause
emissions than other storage piles. One commenter's own data set includes results implying that adequate moisture
leads to compliance, and it is possible to achieve compliance by restricting operations. The commenters did not provide
any detailed information on the control measures in place at the time of the readings, and thus have not demonstrated
that a greater level of control could not achieve the limit. The commenters have also not addressed typical durations
of truck or stacker loading or demonstrated that such loading cannot be restricted in duration or conducted with curtains
or other controls to achieve compliance with the State's limit. Notwithstanding the commenters concerns, in accordance
with Section 116, USEPA cannot disapprove an enforceable, achievable State submittal because it is too stringent.


The commenters have correctly noted that USEPA interprets Method 22 to provide for evaluating whether visible emissions
are occurring anywhere at a storage pile. The alternative is to conduct this evaluation only at a fixed point. This
alternative would provide meaningless results, since visible emissions would likely only be identified for those
moments when an emissions generating event (e.g. bulldozing) happened to occur at the fixed location. Although the
commenter is correct that Method 22 is not explicit on this issue, USEPA's interpretation is longstanding and is analogous
to USEPA's longstanding interpretation that Method 9 opacity readings are also to be taken at the densest part of a
plume at the time of each reading. Clearly the interpretation of test methods affects the stringency of the limitation,
but this does not constitute grounds for disapproving the State's submittal, nor does it constitute grounds for altering
USEPA's interpretation of the test method. 

USEPA recognizes that the State is discussing potential rule revisions with the companies that appealed its rules.
However, no specific revisions have been identified or proposed. If and when the State adopts and submits an alternative
limitation (e.g., an appropriate opacity limitation), USEPA will conduct prompt rulemaking on such a revision.




Comment:

 Several commenters objected to the limits on the number of minutes of visible emissions from roadways and labeled
these limits unreasonable. One commenter notes that ``Method 22 would allow observations to be made at the rear wheels
while following vehicles down the road. As the Utilities continuously have hauling trucks entering and exiting the
premises, this standard is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet.'' 



Response: 

Part of Ohio's submittal is a summary of a study demonstrating that the limits it adopted can be achieved. As with the
storage pile limit, discussed above, USEPA believes that this limit is achievable. Also as with the storage pile limit,
USEPA cannot disapprove a State submittal simply because commenters consider the limit too stringent. Again, if
and when the State adopts and submits a replacement limitation (e.g. an appropriate opacity limit), USEPA will conduct
prompt rulemaking on such replacement limitation. 



Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern about the 20 percent opacity/3-minute average limit as applied to ash handling.
The commenter concedes that emissions are generally low when ash is pneumatically conveyed, but recommended 6 minute
averaging to permit reasonable time to clean up spills. For loading of ash into dump trucks, the commenter noted limits
on the extent to which the ash could be watered, summarized a series of opacity readings showing about half of the 3-minute
averages exceeding 20 percent, and recommended a 35 percent opacity limit. 



Response:

 For pneumatic loading, the commenter has conceded that the limit is generally achievable, and even with respect to
spill conditions has not demonstrated that reasonable measures will not yield compliance with the 20 percent/3-minute
average limit. For dump truck loading, the commenter has not indicated what control measures were undertaken during
the ash loading events that did and did not comply with the 20 percent limit or what differences might explain why compliance
occurs in some cases and not in others. Therefore, the commenter's information does not demonstrate the limits to
be infeasible and, in fact, suggests that reasonable measures yield compliance. 



Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern that the limitations imposed for open dust sources in Cuyahoga County should not
be considered to represent best available technology. 



Response:

 ``Best available technology'' is a requirement for new sources, which are not addressed in this rulemaking. Therefore,
this comment is not germane to this rulemaking.

Comment:

 One commenter disagrees with USEPA's proposed finding that Ohio's rules do not require timely implementation of
RACM at Ford Motor Company's Cleveland Casting Plant. The comments focus on the cupolas, stating that control options
previously under consideration are beyond what controls should be considered reasonably available. Nevertheless,
the commenter states that ``Ford has already submitted to Ohio EPA an alternative control strategy that would provide
for all reductions necessary for attainment to occur by December 10, 1993.'' 



Response:

 Although the commenter believes that further control of the cupolas are not reasonably available, the commenter
has not provided any detailed information to support its view. Also, the commenter does not address other emission
points identified as not demonstrated to have RACM by December 10, 1993. No revised rules have been submitted, and
so USEPA must conclude that the submitted rules do not satisfy the requirement in section 189(a)(1)(C) for RACM in
Cuyahoga County. 

The notice of proposed rulemaking notes that one alternative for satisfying section 189(a)(1)(C) would be to advance
the post-1993 control requirements so as to assure attainment by December 1993. Ford has apparently recommended
State rule revisions which would satisfy the RACM requirement in this manner. If Ohio adopts and submits rule revisions
which require that all measures necessary for attainment be implemented by December 1993, and no substantive new
issues are raised by the submittal, USEPA would be able to publish final rulemaking approving such a revision and concluding
that the RACM requirement is satisfied. 



Comment:

 A commenter notes that Ford has challenged various provisions of the State rules, including the open dust limits,
the reduced exemptions from the general stack opacity limit for startup and shutdown, the procedure for establishing
equivalent visible emission limits, and the provision that contingency measures could be triggered based on air
quality data collected before all SIP control measures are implemented. 



Response:

 The commenter has not provided a basis for USEPA to disapprove these provisions which were proposed for approval.
If the State adopts and submits revisions to these aspects of its plan, USEPA will conduct prompt rulemaking on the
submittal. It should be noted that Ford's revised compliance schedule will provide that all measures shown necessary
for attainment will be implemented prior to the first year of monitoring data (i.e. 1994) which under Section 188(d)
is to be used to judge attainment. 



Comment:

 Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel provides extensive discussion of a modeling reanalysis it plans to conduct both to reassess
emissions from its facility and to reassess the impact of these emissions. 



Response:

 These comments do not provide any modeling results or other information to indicate that the current rules provide
for attainment. These comments also propose several modeling techniques which differ from standard practice (e.g.,
the use of plume rise for the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) based on the Buoyant Line Plume Model) that have not been justified.
In the absence of detailed documentation of a modeling analysis properly demonstrating that attainment is assured,
USEPA must continue to conclude that the requirement in Section 189(a)(1)(B) for assuring attainment has not been
satisfied. 



Comment:

 A commenter identifies several reasons to believe that the BOF at Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel does not have a high fugitive
emission rate. First, no exceedances have been monitored since 1989. Second, these emissions have been in compliance
with the 20 percent/3-minute average opacity limit. Third, evidence included in the State's SIP submittal indicates
that modeling more closely reproduces monitored concentrations if a relatively modest emission rate is assumed.
This commenter expresses concern that this portion of the SIP submittal may have been overlooked. 



Response:

 Each of the commenter's reasons for expecting low BOF fugitive emissions may be addressed individually. First, the
commenter is correct that no exceedances have been observed after 1989. However, monitoring data provide only a limited
indication of fugitive emissions from the BOF, since monitoring data reflect the impact of multiple sources and reflect
actual emissions rather than allowable emissions. More generally, in order to assure attainment, the State's plan
must establish limits such that attainment would occur even if all sources were emitting at full allowable emissions.

) Thus, the absence of monitored exceedances does not indicate that emissions at the BOF or at other nearby sources
are sufficiently limited to assure attainment.

Second, the commenter notes that the BOF is in compliance with the applicable opacity limit. However, this comment
does not address the key question here, namely the quantity of emissions that the applicable opacity limit permits
from this source. 

Third, the commenter notes that a modeling-monitoring comparison suggests relatively low BOF emissions. This comparison
is described most fully in Appendix H to a document presenting the control program suggested by Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corporation, a document which is included as section (d) of Appendix I of the State's submittal. USEPA's technical
support document for this final rulemaking provides a more detailed review of this comparison. USEPA finds the comparison
unreliable, because the analysis found concentrations that did not change in accordance with changes in emissions,
because differences among current allowable emissions and actual emissions at various times were not accounted
for, and because spatial prediction errors (particularly in complex terrain) and other factors introduce substantial
uncertainties into this type of comparison. Consequently, the comparison between modeled and monitored concentrations
does not justify the low emission rate recommended by the company. 

Contrary to the commenter's concern, the proposed rulemaking does reflect a review of the full document prepared
by a Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel contractor and submitted by the State. The principal argument in this document relates
to the quantity of solids collected in the pollution control equipment, and is addressed at column 1 of 58 FR 41223 of
the notice of proposed rulemaking. It should be noted that no specific basis for estimating 99.5 percent capture has
been provided, and this estimate yields an emission rate substantially lower than a ``BOF monitor'' emission factor
also provided in AP-42. Appendix H also provides visible emissions data showing opacity values slightly above
allowable levels, but concedes that these data do not support any particular emission rate. 

In summary, the notice of proposed rulemaking reflected consideration of the evidence contained in the State's submittal,
concluded that allowable emissions at the BOF are substantially greater than those assumed in the attainment demonstration,
and concluded that the State's analysis did not adequately demonstrate attainment. The commenters have not provided
adequate basis to alter this finding. 



Comment:

 A commenter believes that the State's submittal adequately addresses intermediate terrain. The commenter states
that ``at the time of our analysis (January through September 1991), no EPA approved model existed for intermediate
terrain processing. We used software developed for PSD applications in complex terrain in West Virginia and Pennsylvania
and approved by EPA Region III.'' 



Response:

 USEPA guidance now and at the time of SIP development (1991) requires the use of both a simple terrain model and a complex
terrain model at all intermediate terrain receptors. The higher estimated concentration on an hour by hour basis
is used to judge attainment. (See 

Guidelines on Air Quality Models

 and a memorandum on the subject dated June 8, 1989, to Alan Cimorelli from Joseph Tikvart, chief of USEPA's Source Receptor
Analysis Branch.) The commenter is correct that no single model was available at the time of SIP development (1991)
to perform the full analysis. Nevertheless, procedures were (and are) available to perform such an analysis (or,
in many cases, to perform briefer analyses demonstrably giving the same results), some of which were recommended
to Ohio and West Virginia in a meeting with USEPA in March 1991. As for PSD applications, USEPA does not approve PSD permits
in West Virginia or Pennsylvania. Although it is conceivable that USEPA may have failed to identify inappropriate
treatment of intermediate terrain in selected PSD cases, the commenter has not shown that a precedent has been knowingly
set that would be germane to this SIP analysis. Thus, no basis for exempting the State from this requirement exists.




Comment:

 The State comments that condensible particulate matter emissions are negligible in the Steubenville area, but agrees
to reexamine the issue and to address the issue in further documentation to be provided to USEPA. 



Response:

 The technical support document for the notice of proposed rulemaking identified absence of condensible particulate
matter in the Steubenville emissions inventory as one of the deficiencies in the area's attainment demonstration.
These emissions may or may not be minor, and this deficiency cannot be considered addressed without evaluation of
available information for the emission points contained in the inventory. 



Comment:

 The State confirms USEPA's understanding that limits in Rule 3745-17-08(B) apply to all coke pushing
operations and all vented material handling operations in the State. 



Response:

 The notice of proposed rulemaking expressed concern as to the enforceability of Rule 3745-17-08(B) for
coke pushing and ventable materials handling operations. This rule requires implementation of at least one of nine
reasonably available control measures, and sets a limit of 0.030 grains per dry standard cubic foot (or no visible
emissions) if venting is required. USEPA proposed to interpret this rule as applying this limit to coke pushing and
ventable material handling operations. The State's comment confirms that this interpretation is appropriate and
consistent with the State's interpretation. 



Comment:

 One commenter noted that USEPA's notice of proposed rulemaking incorrectly characterized the limit for the one allowed
excursion of the general stack opacity limit as being 27 percent. 



Response:

 The commenter is correct. The Ohio general stack opacity rule being approved today allows the one permissible 6-minute
average excursion of the usual 20 percent opacity limit to have up to 60 percent opacity. 



Comment:

 One commenter submitted a lengthy statement of appeal of the State rules, thereby submitting a variety of comments.
These comments are described further in USEPA's technical support document for this rulemaking. The comments include
expressions of concern about BOF opacity limits, procedures used to adopt these State rules, accuracy of emissions
parameters for LTV, and the need for controls given that monitoring shows attainment. 



Response:

 USEPA's technical support document provides a review of each of the submitted comments. In summary, USEPA has substantial
evidence that the BOF opacity limit is reasonably achievable, USEPA remains satisfied with the procedures used to
adopt these rules, USEPA has no reason to doubt any specific emission parameter (other than the allowable emission
rate for coke quenching), and monitoring does not address whether emissions at full allowable rates would cause violations.




Comment:

 Ohio EPA indicated plans to modify its rules in several ways to address USEPA's concerns. Ohio EPA intends to revise
its quench water test method to provide for weekly averaging of 5 days' samples. Ohio EPA intends to submit a revised
attainment demonstration for the Steubenville area. Ohio EPA intends to modify its rules to require that the entire
control plan for Ford's Cleveland Casting Plant be implemented by December 10, 1993, thereby providing timely satisfaction
of the RACM requirement in Section 189(a)(1)(C). 



Response:

 It appears likely that the anticipated rule revisions concerning quench water testing and concerning Ford's compliance
schedule will satisfactorily address the relevant USEPA concerns. However, USEPA cannot base its review on anticipated
rule revisions and analyses which have not yet been submitted. The comments do not justify revised judgment of the
November 1991 submittal. However, with respect to the Cuyahoga County plan, if Ohio adopts and submits rule revisions
as indicated in its comments, USEPA expects to be able to publish a notice of final approval of this plan, without further
proposal.

With respect to Jefferson County, separate rulemaking is being conducted with respect to the plan for the other part
of the Steubenville area, in Brooke County, West Virginia. A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on January
7, 1994, at 59 FR 988. As a comment on the January rulemaking on West Virginia's SIP, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel submitted
a revised modeling analysis. This material does not warrant revising the proposed evaluation of Ohio's submittal
for several reasons. First, this material was submitted as a comment on a separate rulemaking, was not submitted with
respect to this rulemaking or within the comment period for this rulemaking, and thus is not directly relevant to this
rulemaking. Second, as discussed in more detail in a supplemental USEPA technical support document, a review of this
material indicates that unjustified nonreference modeling and other inappropriate modeling techniques were used.
Third, these materials do not dispute USEPA's judgment of Ohio's submittal, but instead seek to show that an alternate
analysis would demonstrate the adequacy of the State's plan to assure attainment. Section 189(a)(1)(B) requires
that the State submit a demonstration that its plan assures attainment (or that attainment is infeasible). For these
reasons, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's comments do not alter USEPA's view that the State has not demonstrated that
its plan for the Steubenville area assures attainment.


V. Today's Action


Based on the review underlying the proposed action and a review of comments on that proposal, USEPA is today granting
limited approval/limited disapproval of Ohio's particulate matter submittal. Specifically, USEPA is today making
final the action proposed on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41218). Thus, USEPA is approving all regulations in Chapter 3745-17
and Chapter 3745-75 except for Rule 3745-17-05 (which was not submitted) and except for Rule 3745-17-12(P)(6)(a)
and Rule 3745-17-03(B)(10)(c) (pertaining to quench water quality). USEPA is disapproving Rule 3745-17-12(P)(6)(a)
and Rule 3745-17-03(B)(10)(c).
On the other hand, USEPA is today issuing final limited disapproval of Ohio's plans for Cuyahoga and Jefferson Counties
for failure to satisfy certain requirements of Part D. The bases for the disapproval of the Cuyahoga County plan are
the failure to satisfy the requirement for RACM given in sections 189(a)(1)(C) and 172(c)(1) and the failure to assure
attainment as required in section 189(a)(1)(B) and to satisfy the related requirements in sections 172(c)(2), 172(c)(3),
and 172(c)(6). Although the notice of proposed rulemaking did not explicitly propose to find failure to assure attainment,
the proposal made clear that assurance of attainment was contingent on remedying deficiencies in the State's quench
water test method. Since this method was not revised, USEPA now finds that the State has not demonstrated that the plan
assures attainment. The basis for the disapproval of the Jefferson County plan is the failure to satisfy the requirement
to assure attainment given in sections 189(a)(1)(B) and the related requirements in sections 172(c)(2), 172(c)(3),
and 172(c)(6), due to the use of inappropriate emissions estimates for Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's basic oxygen
furnace, coke ovens, and other emission sources, and various modeling issues.
The notice of proposed rulemaking discusses alternatives by which the Cuyahoga County plan could satisfy the requirement
for RACM. The State has committed in essence to implementing one of these alternatives, namely to advance Ford's compliance
deadlines, such that all measures reflected in the submitted attainment demonstration are required by December
1993. The notice of proposed rulemaking also specifies remedies for the deficiency in the coke quenching test method.
Thus, if the State submits rules that have been revised accordingly, USEPA can proceed directly to final approval
of these revisions without further proposal, provided these revisions do not raise new issues. Such revisions would
address all identified bases for disapproving the Cuyahoga County plan, and so such USEPA rulemaking could reverse
today's limited disapproval of the Cuyahoga County plan and find all particulate matter SIP requirements addressed
in today's rulemaking for this area satisfied.

3

 Note that revisions to the Steubenville area plan would likely raise new issues and thus would likely require further
proposed rulemaking.




Finally, USEPA is today making a final determination on particulate matter precursors consistent with its proposed
determination. Specifically, USEPA is today determining that precursors do not contribute significantly to violations
of the particulate matter standards in Ohio. As a result, the otherwise applicable provision of Section 189(e) that
particulate matter precursor sources must meet the same control requirements as primary sources of particulate
matter does not apply.
This disapproval constitutes a disapproval under section 179(a)(2) of the Act (see generally 57 FR 13566-67).
As provided under section 179(a) of the Act, one of two sanctions in Section 179(b) is to take effect 18 months from the
publication of this final rule unless the relevant deficiencies are corrected in the meantime. The second sanction
in Section 179(b) is to take effect 24 months from the publication of this final rule, again unless the relevant deficiencies
are corrected in the meantime. These two sanctions are (1) A requirement for two-to-one new source review offsets
for sources in or near the Cuyahoga and Jefferson County nonattainment areas and, (2) a sanction against highway funding
in these two areas. Separate rulemaking is being conducted to determine which of these sanctions would apply first
and to address related questions concerning the effectuation of such sanctions. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking
dated October 1, 1993 (58 FR 51270).) Any sanction USEPA imposes must remain in place until USEPA determines that the
deficiency has been corrected. This disapproval also triggers the requirement for USEPA to impose a federal implementation
plan under section 110(c)(1) of the Act if the deficiencies are not corrected within 2 years.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq., 

USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. 

v. 

USEPA, 

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), based on revised SIP processing review tables approved by the Acting Assistant
Administrator for Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators).
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Tables Two and Three SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on USEPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 26, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section

Nevada: Final Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management 
Program Revisions 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Immediate final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The State of Nevada has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review
of Nevada's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Nevada's hazardous waste
program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends
to approve Nevada's hazardous waste program revisions. Nevada's application for program revision is available
for public review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background 



States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous
waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain
other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in
40 CFR parts 124, 260-266, 268, 270, and 279. 



B. Nevada 



Nevada initially received final authorization for the base hazardous waste program on November 1, 1985. On June 29,
1992, Nevada received final authorization for revisions to its hazardous waste program, which included substantially
all the Federal RCRA implementing regulations published in the 

Federal Register

 through July 1, 1991. On May 9, 1994, Nevada submitted an application for additional revision approvals. Today, Nevada
is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 

EPA has reviewed Nevada's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Nevada's hazardous waste program
revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends
to approve final authorization for Nevada's hazardous waste program revisions. The public may submit written comments
on EPA's immediate final decision up until June 27, 1994. Copies of Nevada's applications for program revision are
available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the 

Addresses

 section of this notice. 

Approval of Nevada's program revisions is effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's
revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received,
EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to the
comment which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. 

Nevada is applying for authorization for changes and additions to the Federal RCRA implementing regulations that
occurred between July 1, 1991 and July 1, 1993, including the following Federal hazardous waste regulations:

Nevada agrees to review all State hazardous waste permits that have been issued under State law prior to the effective
date of this authorization. Nevada agrees to then modify or revoke and reissue such permits as necessary to require
compliance with the revised State program. The modifications or revocation and reissuance will be scheduled in the
annual State Grant Work Plan. 

Nevada is not being authorized to operate any portion of the hazardous waste program on Indian lands. 



C. Decision 



I conclude that Nevada's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements
established by RCRA. Accordingly, Nevada is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program
as revised. 

Nevada is now responsible for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying
out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program applications, subject to the limitations of the
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98-616, November 8, 1984) (``HSWA''). Nevada also
has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section
3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under section 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12866.




Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Nevada's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for
handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Significant New Uses of Certain Chemical Substances 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is promulgating significant new use rules (SNURs) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for certain chemical substances which were the subject of premanufacture notices (PMNs) and subject to TSCA section
5(e) consent orders issued by EPA. Today's action requires persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process
these substances for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacturing or processing
of the substance for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice will provide EPA with
the opportunity to evaluate the intended use, and if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it occurs.
EPA is promulgating this SNUR using direct final procedures. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This SNUR will require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing manufacturing or processing a substance
for any activity designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The supporting rationale and background to this
rule are more fully set out in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the rules and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.

Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the substance
for that use. The mechanism for reporting under this requirement is established under 40 CFR 721.10. 



II. Applicability of General Provisions 


General provisions for SNURs appear under subpart A of 40 CFR part 721. These provisions describe persons subject
to the rule, recordkeeping requirements, exemptions to reporting requirements, and applicability of the rule to
uses occurring before the effective date of the final rule. Provisions relating to user fees appear at 40 CFR part 700.
Persons subject to this SNUR must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of PMNs under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submission
requirements of section 5(b) and 5(d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (2), (3), and (5), and the
regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e),
5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities on which it has received the SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, EPA is required
under section 5(g) to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action.

Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Persons
who intend to import a chemical substance identified in a final SNUR are subject to the TSCA section 13 import certification
requirements, which are codified at 19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127 and 127.28. Such persons must certify that they are
in compliance with the SNUR requirements. The EPA policy in support of the import certification appears at 40 CFR part
707. 



III. Substances Subject to This Rule



EPA is establishing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substances under
40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for each substance, including its PMN number,
chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the action
taken by EPA in the section 5(e) consent order or as a non-section 5(e) SNUR for the substance (including the statutory
citation and specific finding), toxicity concern, and the CFR citation assigned in the regulatory text section of
this rule. The specific uses which are designated as significant new uses are cited in the regulatory text section
of the rule by reference to 40 CFR part 721 subpart B where the significant new uses are described in detail. Certain
new uses, including production limits and other uses designated in the rule are claimed as CBI. The procedure for obtaining
confidential information is set out in Unit VII. of this preamble.

Where the underlying section 5(e) order prohibits the PMN submitter from exceeding a specified production limit
without performing specific tests to determine the health or environmental effects of a substance, the tests are
described in this unit. As explained further in Unit VI. of this preamble, the SNUR for such substances contains the
same production limit, and exceeding the production limit is defined as a significant new use. Persons who intend
to exceed the production limit must notify the Agency by submitting a significant new use notice (SNUN) at least 90
days in advance. In addition, this unit describes tests that are recommended by EPA to provide sufficient information
to evaluate the substance, but for which no production limit has been established in the section 5(e) order. Descriptions
of recommended tests are provided for informational purposes. Data on potential exposures or releases of the substances,
testing other than that specified in the section 5(e) order for the substances, or studies on analogous substances,
which may demonstrate that the significant new uses being reported do not present an unreasonable risk, may be included
with significant new use notification. Persons submitting a SNUN must comply with the same notice requirements and
EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs, as stated in 40 CFR 721.1(c), including submission of test data on
health and environmental effects as described in 40 CFR 720.50. EPA is not publishing SNURs for 14 PMN substances:
P-93-67, P-93-68, P-93-184, P-93-185, P-93-186, P-93-187,
P-93-188, P-93-190, P-93-282, P-93-317, P-93-318, P-93-476,
P-93-721, and P-93-959 which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order. The 5(e) consent orders
for these substances are derived from an exposure finding based solely on substantial production volume and significant
or substantial human exposure and/or release to the environment of substantial quantities. For these cases there
were limited or no toxicity data available for the PMN substances. In such cases, EPA regulates the new chemical substances
under section 5(e) by requiring certain toxicity tests. For instance, chemical substances with potentially substantial
releases to surface waters would be subject to toxicity testing of aquatic organisms and chemicals with potentially
substantial human exposures would be subject to health effects testing for mutagenicity, acute effects, and subchronic
effects. However, for these substances the short-term toxicity testing required by the 5(e) order is usually completed
within 1 to 2 years of notice of commencement. EPA's experience with exposure-based SNURs requiring short-term testing
is that the SNUR is often revoked within 1 to 2 years when the test results are received. Rather than issue and revoke
SNURs in such a short span of time, EPA will defer publication of exposure-based SNURs until either a Notice of Commencement
(NOC) or data demonstrating risk are received unless the toxicity testing required is long-term. EPA is issuing this
explanation and notification as required in 40 CFR 721.160(a)(2) as it has determined that SNURs are not needed at
this time for these substances which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order under TSCA. The section 5(e) orders for
P-92-776, P-92-777, and P-93-214 contain new chemical exposure limits (NCEL)
provisions. In each case, the section 5(e) order allows the PMN submitter and the submitter's customers to protect
workers by controlling and monitoring airborne concentrations of the substance present in the workplace as an alternative
to certain respirator requirements. A clause had been added to these SNURs stating that as an alternative to the respiratory
protection designated in the SNUR, manufacturers, importers, and processors may follow the same NCEL provisions
found in the section 5(e) consent orders for these substances, including using only EPA-approved sampling and analytical
methods if approval is stipulated by the 5(e) consent order. No general NCEL language has been added to the regulatory
text of the corresponding SNURs as EPA expects that only manufacturers, importers, and processors with access to
the original 5(e) consent order of the original PMN submitter will be able to readily use this clause. EPA recommends
that any company proposing to substitute NCEL or other alternative control measures for SNUR provisions consult
EPA either by submitting a SNUN or requesting a determination of equivalency under the procedures for ``EPA Approval
of Alternative Control Measures'' in  721.30.

CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.4794. 



PMN Numbers P-88-1937 and P-88-1938





Chemical name:

 (generic) Substituted 2-nitro- and 2-aminobenzesulfonamide. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 September 15, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. 

Toxicity concern:

 Similar chemicals have been shown to cause aquatic and terrestrial toxicity in test species. Based on this data, EPA
expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at concentrations of 100 ppb (parts per billion) for P-88-1937
and 10 ppb for P-88-1938 in surface waters. EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substances could
result in releases to surface waters where the concentration would be greater than 100 ppb for P-88-1937
and greater than 10 ppb for P-88-1938. 


Recommended testing:

 To help characterize the terrestrial effects, the following studies are recommended: Inherent biodegradation
in soil (40 CFR 796.3400), earthworm toxicity test ( 795.150, proposed June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29155)), early seedling
growth test (40 CFR 797.2800), soil microbial community test (40 CFR 797.3700), and aerobic biodegradation test
(aquatic) (40 CFR 796.3100). To help characterize the aquatic toxicity effects, the following studies are recommended:
Acute algal (40 CFR 797.1050) (static/nominal conditions), acute daphnid (40 CFR 797.1300) (flow-through/measured
conditions), and acute fish (40 CFR 797.1400) (flow-through/measured conditions).


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.1612. 



PMN Number P-91-659





Chemical name:

 (generic) 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(substituted)-1,3,5-triazine, dihydrochloride. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 July 20, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to environment. 

Toxicity concern:

 Similar chemicals have been shown to cause aquatic and terrestrial toxicity in test species. Based on this data, EPA
expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of 10 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters.
EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substance could result in releases to surface waters where the concentration
of the PMN substance would be greater than 10 ppb. 


Recommended testing:

 To help characterize the terrestrial effects, the following studies are recommended: Early life seedling growth
toxicity study (40 CFR 797.2800), inherent biodegradation in soil (40 CFR 796.3400), earthworm subchronic toxicity
study ( 795.150, proposed June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29155)), soil microbial community toxicity study (40 CFR 797.3700),
and plant life cycle growth test (40 CFR 797.2830). To help characterize the aquatic toxicity effects, the following
studies are recommended: Acute algal study (40 CFR 797.1050), acute daphnia study (40 CFR 797.1300), and acute fish
study (40 CFR 797.1400).


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.9750. 



PMN Number P-91-689





Chemical name:

 (generic) Trisubstituted anthracene. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 October 6, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment. 


Toxicity concern:

 Laboratory animal test data on chemicals similar in structure to the PMN substance indicate that the PMN substance
may cause carcinogenicity in humans. Similar substances have also been shown to cause toxicity in aquatic organisms.
Specifically, based on quantitative structural activity relationships on similar neutral organic compounds,
EPA predicts acute toxicity to aquatic organisms could occur at 2 ppb in surface waters. 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a 

Salmonella typhimurium

 reverse mutation assay (Ames test) (40 CFR 798.5625) and a 7,12-dimethylbenz[

a

]anthracene-12-

O

-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate tumor promoter test may help characterize the carcinogenic effects of the PMN
substance. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed specified production limits without performing these tests.
However, the results of each preceding study will be used by EPA to determine if the next study may not be required. EPA
believes that an oncogenicity test (two-species, dermal) (40 CFR 798.3300) would help characterize the human health
effects and the following aquatic toxicity tests would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance:
A 96-h bioassay in algae (40 CFR 797.1050), a 48-h LC50 test in 

Daphnia

 (40 CFR 797.1300), and a 96-h LC50 test in fish (40 CFR 797.1400).

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. 


Toxicity concern:

 Similar chemicals have been shown to cause carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and developmental and reproductive
toxicities in test animals. Test data on P-92-777 indicate the potential for eye corrosion and lung damage.
Similar chemicals have also been shown to cause toxic effects in aquatic organisms. 


Recommended testing:









The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the production volume limit without performing the 90-day subchronic
study.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.2950.

 August 7, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to human health. 

Toxicity concern:

 Test data on structurally similar chemical substances have been shown to cause developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity
in test animals. 


Recommended testing:

 The Agency has determined that the results of the following toxicity testing and exposure monitoring would help characterize
possible human health risks caused by the manufacture, import, processing, and use of the PMN substance: A 28-day
inhalation study in rats (OECD guideline 407) modified to include a functional observation battery and neuropathology
(NTIS: PB 91-1546170), and workplace airborne monitoring (NIOSH Analytical Methods nos. 0500 and 0600, total
nuisance dust and respirable nuisance dust, respectively).

PMN Number P-93-333





Chemical name:

 (generic) Lecithins, phospholipase A2-hydrolyzed. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 July 9, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that these substances may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment. 

Toxicity concern:

 Test data on structurally similar chemical substances indicate that the PMN substances may cause toxicity to aquatic
organisms. Based on this data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of 10 ppb of the
PMN substances in surface waters. EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substances could result in releases
to surface waters where the concentration of the PMN substances would be greater than 10 ppb. 


Recommended testing:

 The Agency has determined that the results of the following acute aquatic toxicity testing would help characterize
possible environmental effects of the substances: Algal (40 CFR 797.1050), daphnid (40 CFR 797.1300), fish (40 CFR
797.1400), and fish acute toxicity mitigated by humic acid (40 CFR 850.1085). All tests should be conducted with static
conditions and nominal concentrations. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the production volume limit without
performing these tests.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.4585. 



PMN Number P-93-364





Chemical name:

 (generic) Polyepoxy polyol. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as a coating. Based on analogy to epoxides, the PMN substance may cause cancer and reproductive
effects. EPA has determined that workers exposed by inhalation may be at risk for these toxic effects. EPA determined
that use of the substance as a granule as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because significant
inhalation exposure will not occur. EPA has determined that use in a powder form may result in significant inhalation
exposures. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(1)(i)(C)
and (b)(3)(ii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a 90-day oral subchronic study with special attention to the testes (40 CFR 798.2650)
will help characterize the health effects of the PMN substance.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.7710. 



PMN Number P-93-699





Chemical name:

 (generic) Substituted benzenedicarboxylic acid ester. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 September 21, 1993. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. 


Toxicity concern:

 Similar chemicals have been shown to cause cancer in test animals and ecotoxicity effects in aquatic organisms. 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that the results of a 2-year rodent bioassay (40 CFR 798.33) would help characterize the potential
carcinogenic effects of the PMN substance. In addition, to characterize the potential aquatic toxicity effects,
EPA has determined that an acute algal study (40 CFR 797.1050), an acute daphnid study (40 CFR 797.1300), and an acute
fish study (40 CFR 797.1400) would be helpful. Human health toxicity data on representative members of the acrylate/methacrylate
class of chemical substances being developed by certain acrylate and methacrylate manufacturers may also be useful
in evaluating the risk posed by the PMN substance.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.2930. 



PMN Number P-93-1047





Chemical name:

 Benzenesulfonic acid, 4-methyl-, reaction products with oxirane mono[(C

10-16

-alkyloxy)methyl] derivatives and 2,2,4(or 2,4,4)-trimethyl-1,6-hexanediamine. 


CAS number:

 147170-38-5. 


Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as a coatings component. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances,
EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 1 ppb of the PMN substance
in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable
risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance
may result in releases to surface waters. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria
at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.1645. 



PMN Number P-93-1119





Chemical name:

 (generic) Organotin lithium compound. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Toxicity concern:

 The substance will be used as a catalyst. Test data on organotin pesticides indicate that the substance may cause toxicity
to aquatic organisms. Based on these data, EPA expects toxicity to aquatic organisms to occur at a concentration of
1 ppb of the substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present
an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that manufacture,
processing, and use of the substance for uses other than as a catalyst could result in releases to surface waters. Based
on this information, the substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.9668. 



PMN Number P-93-1166





Chemical name:

 (generic) Alkylsulfonium salt. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy to dialkyl cationic quaternary nitrogen surfactants,
EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 50 ppb of the PMN substance
in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable
risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters resulting in concentrations above 50 ppb. EPA has
determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface water at concentrations above 50 ppb.
Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.

 40 CFR 721.7655. 



PMN Number P-93-1183





Chemical name:

 (generic) Substituted quinoline. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances,
EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 20 ppb of the PMN substance
in surface waters. Based on analogy of the substance to other quinolines, EPA is concerned that developmental and
reproductive toxicity may occur to exposed workers. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN
did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters and significant
worker exposure would not occur because the substance was used in an enclosed process. EPA has determined that other
uses of the substance may result in releases to surface waters which exceed the concern concentration and significant
worker exposure. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii)
and (b)(3)(ii). 


Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.
EPA has determined that a two-generation reproduction study (40 CFR 798.4700), and a developmental toxicity study
(40 CFR 708.4900) would help characterize the health effects of the PMN substance.

(P-93-1204) 124029-00-1.




Basis for action:

 The PMN substances will be used as intermediates. Based on analogy of the substances to ester compounds, EPA is concerned
that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 80 ppb of P-93-1193, 1194, 1195,
and 1196, and 60 ppb of P-93-1203 and 1204, in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substances
as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substances would not be released to surface
waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substances may result in releases to surface waters. Based on this
information, the PMN substances meet the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4) (iii). 



Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substances.

that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 80 ppb of P-93-1197, and 60 ppb
of P-93-1201, 1202, and 1205, in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substances as described
in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has
determined that other uses of the substances may result in releases to surface waters. Based on this information,
the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 



Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substances.

Basis for action:

 The PMN substances will be used as intermediates. Based on analogy of the substances to ester compounds, EPA is concerned
that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 60 ppb of the PMN substances in surface waters.
EPA determined that use of the substances as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substances
would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substances may result in releases
to surface waters. Based on this information, the PMN substances meet the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii).




Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),

Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy of the substance to ester compounds, EPA is concerned
that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 80 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters.
EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance
would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases
to surface waters. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii).




Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),

Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as a dispersing agent. Based on analogy test data on the sulfate form of the substance,
EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 600 ppb of the PMN substance
in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable
risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters resulting at concentrations above 600 ppb. EPA
has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface water at concentrations above 600
ppb. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 



Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),

CAS number:

 Not available. 



Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy to acrylates, the PMN substance may cause cancer
and may cause toxicity to aquatic organisms in surface waters at concentrations as low as 60 ppb. EPA has determined
that persons exposed dermally to the PMN substance may be at risk for cancer. EPA determined that use of the substance
as an intermediate did not present an unreasonable risk because there were no significant dermal exposures or environmental
releases. EPA has determined that use of the substance other than as an intermediate may result in significant dermal
or environmental exposures. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(3)(ii)
and (b)(4)(iii). 



Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a 2-year two-species oral bioassay (40 CFR 798.3300) would help characterize the health
effects of the PMN substance and a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR
797.1300), and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects
of the PMN substance.

Basis for action:

 The PMN substance will be used as an intermediate. Based on analogy of the substance to neutral organic substances,
EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at concentrations as low as 400 ppb of the PMN substance
in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable
risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance
may result in releases to surface waters which exceed the concern concentration. Based on this information, the PMN
substance meets the concern criteria at  721.170(b)(4)(iii). 



Recommended testing:

 EPA has determined that a fish acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1400), a daphnid acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1300),
and an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050) would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.

IV. Objectives and Rationale of the Rule



During review of the PMNs submitted for the chemical substances that are subject to this SNUR, EPA concluded that for
10 of the substances regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient
to make reasoned evaluations of the health or environmental effects of the substances. The basis for such findings
is outlined in Unit III. of this preamble. Based on these findings, section 5(e) consent orders requiring the use of
appropriate controls were negotiated with the PMN submitters; the SNUR provisions for these substances designated
herein are consistent with the provisions of the section 5(e) orders.

In the other 22 cases for which the proposed uses are not regulated under a section 5(e) order, EPA determined that one
or more of the criteria of concern established at 40 CFR 721.170 were met.

EPA is issuing this SNUR for specific chemical substances which have undergone premanufacture review to ensure that:
EPA will receive notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process a listed chemical substance for
a significant new use before that activity begins; EPA will have an opportunity to review and evaluate data submitted
in a SNUN before the notice submitter begins manufacturing, importing, or processing a listed chemical substance
for a significant new use; when necessary to prevent unreasonable risks EPA will be able to regulate prospective manufacturers,
importers, or processors of a listed chemical substance before a significant new use of that substance occurs; and
all manufacturers, importers, and processors of the same chemical substance which is subject to a section 5(e) order
are subject to similar requirements. Issuance of a SNUR for a chemical substance does not signify that the substance
is listed on the TSCA Inventory. Manufacturers, importers, and processors are responsible for ensuring that a new
chemical substance subject to a final SNUR is listed on the TSCA Inventory. 


V. Direct Final Procedure



EPA is issuing these SNURs as direct final rules, as described in 40 CFR 721.160(c)(3) and 721.170(d)(4). In accordance
with 40 CFR 721.160(c)(3)(ii), this rule will be effective July 26, 1994, unless EPA receives a written notice by June
27, 1994 that someone wishes to make adverse or critical comments on EPA's action. If EPA receives such a notice, EPA
will publish a notice to withdraw the direct final SNUR(s) for the specific substance(s) to which the adverse or critical
comments apply. EPA will then propose a SNUR for the specific substance(s) providing a 30-day comment period.
This action establishes SNURs for a number of chemical substances. Any person who submits a notice of intent to submit
adverse or critical comments must identify the substance and the new use to which it applies. EPA will not withdraw
a SNUR for a substance not identified in a notice. 


VI. Test Data and Other Information 


EPA recognizes that section 5 of TSCA does not require developing any particular test data before submission of a SNUN.
Persons are required only to submit test data in their possession or control and to describe any other data known to
or reasonably ascertainable by them. In cases where a section 5(e) order requires or recommends certain testing,
Unit III. of this preamble lists those recommended tests. However, EPA has established production limits in the section
5(e) orders for several of the substances regulated under this rule, in view of the lack of data on the potential health
and environmental risks that may be posed by the significant new uses or increased exposure to the substances. These
production limits cannot be exceeded unless the PMN submitter first submits the results of toxicity tests that would
permit a reasoned evaluation of the potential risks posed by these substances. Under recent consent orders, each
PMN submitter is required to submit each study at least 14 weeks (earlier orders required submissions at least 12 weeks)
before reaching the specified production limit. Listings of the tests specified in the section 5(e) orders are included
in Unit III. of this preamble. The SNURs contain the same production volume limits as the consent orders. Exceeding
these production limits is defined as a significant new use. The recommended studies may not be the only means of addressing
the potential risks of the substance. However, SNUNs submitted for significant new uses without any test data may
increase the likelihood that EPA will take action under section 5(e), particularly if satisfactory test results
have not been obtained from a prior submitter. EPA recommends that potential SNUN submitters contact EPA early enough
so that they will be able to conduct the appropriate tests. SNUN submitters should be aware that EPA will be better able
to evaluate SNUNs which provide detailed information on:

(1) Human exposure and environmental release that may result from the significant new use of the chemical substances.

(2) Potential benefits of the substances.

(3) Information on risks posed by the substances compared to risks posed by potential substitutes. 


VII. Procedural Determinations 


EPA is establishing through this rule some significant new uses which have been claimed as CBI. EPA is required to keep
this information confidential to protect the CBI of the original PMN submitter. EPA promulgated a procedure to deal
with the situation where a specific significant new use is CBI. This procedure appears in 40 CFR 721.1725(b)(1) and
is similar to that in  721.11 for situations where the chemical identity of the substance subject to a SNUR is
CBI. This procedure is cross-referenced in each of these SNURs.

A manufacturer or importer may request EPA to determine whether a proposed use would be a significant new use under
this rule. Under the procedure incorporated from  721.1725(b)(1), a manufacturer or importer must show that
it has a 

bona fide

 intent to manufacture or import the substance and must identify the specific use for which it intends to manufacture
or import the substance. If EPA concludes that the person has shown a 

bona fide

 intent to manufacture or import the substance, EPA will tell the person whether the use identified in the 

bona fide

 submission would be a significant new use under the rule. Since most of the chemical identities of the substances subject
to these SNURs are also CBI, manufacturers and processors can combine the 

bona fide

 submission under the procedure in  721.1725(b)(1) with that under  721.11 into a single step.

If a manufacturer or importer is told that the production volume identified in the 

bona fide

 submission would not be a significant new use, i.e. it is below the level that would be a significant new use, that person
can manufacture or import the substance as long as the aggregate amount does not exceed that identified in the 

bona fide

 submission to EPA. If the person later intends to exceed that volume, a new 

bona fide

 submission would be necessary to determine whether that higher volume would be a significant new use. EPA is considering
whether to adopt a special procedure for use when CBI production volume is designated as a significant new use. Under
such a procedure, a person showing a 

bona fide

 intent to manufacture or import the substance, under the procedure described in  721.11, would automatically
be informed of the production volume that would be a significant new use. Thus the person would not have to make multiple


bona fide

 submissions to EPA for the same substance to remain in compliance with the SNUR, as could be the case under the procedures
in  721.1725(b)(1). 


VIII. Applicability of Rule to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final Rule 


To establish a significant ``new'' use, EPA must determine that the use is not ongoing. The chemical substances subject
to this rule have recently undergone premanufacture review. Section 5(e) orders have been issued for 10 substances
and notice submitters are prohibited by the section 5(e) orders from undertaking activities which EPA is designating
as significant new uses. In cases where EPA has not received an NOC and the substance has not been added to the Inventory,
no other person may commence such activities without first submitting a PMN. For substances for which an NOC has not
been submitted at this time, EPA has concluded that the uses are not ongoing. However, EPA recognizes in cases when
chemical substances identified in this SNUR are added to the Inventory prior to the effective date of the rule, the
substances may be manufactured, imported, or processed by other persons for a significant new use as defined in this
rule before the effective date of the rule. However, 14 of the 32 substances contained in this rule have CBI chemical
identities, and since EPA has received a limited number of post-PMN 

bona fide

 submissions, the Agency believes that it is highly unlikely that any of the significant new uses described in the following
regulatory text are ongoing. As discussed in the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating
a use as a significant new use as of this date of publication rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Thus, persons
who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substances regulated through this SNUR will have
to cease any such activity before the effective date of this rule. To resume their activities, these persons would
have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.

EPA has promulgated provisions to allow persons to comply with this SNUR before the effective date. If a person were
to meet the conditions of advance compliance under  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the
requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing
of the substance between publication and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance,
they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would
have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. 


IX. Economic Analysis



EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance subject to this rule. EPA's complete economic analysis is available
in the public record for this rule (OPPTS-50615). 



X. Rulemaking Record 


EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS-50615). The record includes
information considered by EPA in developing this rule. A public version of the record without any confidential business
information is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located at Rm. E-G099, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.



XI. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 



A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
 Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has determined that approximately 10 percent of the parties
affected by this rule could be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substances.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms.



C. Paperwork Reduction Act. 


The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been approved by OMB under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and have been assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (2070-0012),
Washington, DC 20503.

SUBPART 101-37.12_FEDERAL AGENCY AVIATION SAFETY PROGRAM 



 101-37.1200 

General. 



(a) This subpart sets forth guidance to agencies for establishing aviation safety programs in accordance with the
direction given to GSA in OMB Circular A-126, but the subpart is not binding on other agencies. 

(b) The aviation safety program objective is the safe accomplishment of the agency mission, and is a direct result
of effective management which should include attention to detail sufficient to preclude the occurrence of an accident.
Each agency should establish appropriate key management positions and define their responsibilities and qualifications.
Agencies should ensure these positions are staffed with properly qualified personnel. 



 101-37.1201 

Applicability. 



As prescribed in this subpart 101-37.12, the requirement to develop and operate an aviation safety program
which addresses all program facets including, but not limited to, flight, ground, and weapons environments, is applicable
to all Federal aviation programs. 



 101-37.1202 

Agency aviation safety responsibilities. 



Agencies operating aviation programs are responsibilities for establishing and conducting a comprehensive aviation
safety program. Agencies should appoint qualified aviation safety managers at both the national and operational
program level. 



 101-37.1203 

Avaiation safety manager qualifications. 



(a) Aviation safety manager positions may be full time or additional duty, based on program mission requirements.
In general, an aviation safety manger should, regardless of management level: 

(1) Be knowledgeable in agency aviation program activities within his/her purview; 

(2) Have experience as a pilot, crew member, or in aviation operations management; and 

(3) Be a graduate of a recognized aviation safety officer or accident prevention course, or qualified within 1 year
through attendance at formal courses(s) of instruction. 

(b) These standards should be used as a guide to ensure that qualified personnel are selected as safety managers. However,
they do not supersede those job classifications prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management or other appropriate
authority. 



 101-37.1204 

Program responsibilities. 



Agencies will ensure that policies, objectives, and standards are established and clearly defined to support an
effective aviation accident prevention effort. The aviation safety manager should develop and implement an agency
aviation safety program which integrates agency safety policy into aviation related activities. 



 101-37.1205 

Program elements. 



As a recommendation, aviation safety program elements should include, but not be limited to, the following: 

(a) Aviation safety council; 

(b) Inspections and evaluations; 

(c) Hazard reporting; 

(d) Aircraft accident and incident investigation; 

(e) Education and training; 

(f) Aviation protective equipment; 

(g) Aviation qualification and certification; and 

(h) Awards program. 



 101-37.1206 

Aviation safety council. 



(a) Each agency should establish aviation safety councils at the appropriate aircraft operations level. The purpose
of the council is to promote safety by exchanging ideas, reviewing, and discussing hazard reports and accident and
incident reports, and assessing the threat to safe operation inherent in mission operations plans. The council should
function to recommend changes to agency policies, rules, regulations, procedures, and operations based upon such
discussions, reviews, and assessments. The council should meet regularly and should consist, at a minimum, of those
individuals within the organization responsible for the following areas:

(1) Operations/mission planning; 

(2) Safety; 

(3) Aircrew training; 

(4) Maintenance; and 

(5) Aircrew scheduling.

<TEXT>
 

(b) Safety meetings for operations and maintenance personnel are used to increase the education and awareness of
agency personnel regarding the hazards associated with aviation and to discuss mishap prevention. Meetings should
be scheduled and conducted on a regular basis.



 101-37.1207



Inspections and evaluations.



The purpose of any inspection or evaluation is to prevent aviation accidents and to foster aviation safety.

(a) Each agency should establish and maintain an inspection and evaluation program for all aviation activities.
All operational elements of the aviation activity should be regularly inspected and evaluated based on standardized
criteria established by the agency. The purpose of this program is to ensure that the agency mission is being carried
out in accordance with Federal and agency safety regulations and directives.

(b) Records should be kept and will identify the function or work area involved, date(s), hazard(s) identified, and
recommended corrective action(s). All agencies will ensure appropriate resolution and close-out.



 101-37.1208



Hazard reporting.



Each agency safety program should include an aviation hazard reporting and resolution tracking system. Hazards
are identified as conditions, practices, or procedures that constitute an immediate or potential threat to the safe
conduct of aviation operations and may be reported by any person. Reports may be submitted on any event, procedure,
practice, or condition that adversely affects safety of aviation operations. Prompt resolution of hazards, by safety
threat priority, should be the goal of the agency.



 101-37.1209



Aircraft accident and incident investigation and reporting.



Each agency aviation safety program should have an aircraft accident and incident investigation and reporting capability
(see subpart 101-37.11).



 101-37.1210



Education and training.



Each aviation operations program should develop and conduct aviation safety training within applicable OPM guidelines.
Identification, development, and presentation of training needs that are unique to respective programs should
be accomplished as required. Training frequency, duration, and currency requirements should be developed for each
safety discipline, and should consist of initial and recurring training.



 101-37.1211



Aviation protective equipment.



Each agency should establish an aviation protective equipment program. Such a program should ensure that all personnel
flying aboard agency aircraft are equipped with, or have at their disposal, appropriate aviation life support equipment.



 101-37.1212



Aircrew qualification and certification.



Minimum standards for aircraft operations are established by OPM Position Classification Series GS-2181.
Agencies should periodically review operational requirements to establish or revise aircrew standards. Such standards
should ensure that aircrew members meet the minimum qualification and certification necessary for the continued
safe operation of aircraft.



 101-37.1213



Aircraft accident and incident database.



Each agency should establish an aircraft accident and incident data collection system to support an effective aviation
safety and accident prevention program. The database should include:

(a) Owner and operator of the aircraft;

(b) Federal Aviation Administration registration number or assigned tail number;

(c) Aircraft make, model, and serial number;

(d) Location of occurrence;

(e) Date of mishap (month/day/year);

(f) Type of mishap, accident, or incident (see  101-37.1101, Definitions);

(g) Estimated damage to the aircraft;

(h) Type of injury; no injury, serious injury, or fatal injury (see  101-37.1101, Definitions);

(i) Brief description of the circumstances; and

(j) Name of the investigator as it appears on the factual report (see  101-37.1108).



 101-37.1214

Federal Travel Regulation; Title Requirements for Reimbursement of Residence Transaction Expenses



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Supply Service, GSA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to allow reimbursement for residence transaction expenses
in accordance with equitable title ownership, and to incorporate certain editorial corrections and clarifications.
This amendment is intended to provide equitable residence transaction expense reimbursement to Federal employees
who transfer in the interest of the Government.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This amendment modifies the rules governing residence title requirements to recognize and provide reimbursement
to an employee based on equitable title interests. This amendment recognizes the following four specific equitable
title situations: (1) when title is held in trust for the benefit of the employee; (2) when title is held in the name of
a financial institution pursuant to state laws governing financing arrangements secured by real property; (3) when
title is held in the name of an accommodation party; and (4) when title is held by the seller of the real property under
a financial arrangement which requires fixed periodic payments and transfer of title to the employee upon completion
of the payment schedule. The amendment also recognizes ``other equitable title situations'' when documentation
requirements specified in the regulation can be met.



Title Held in Trust



This amendment modifies the FTR to allow an employee to be reimbursed for the sale or purchase of real property when
title to the property is held in trust for the benefit of the employee, a member of the employee's immediate family,
or both. Previously, this was allowed under a decision of the Comptroller General (CG) of the United States (

Paul D. Atkinson

, 70 Comp. Gen. 363 (1991)). This amendment explicitly states the conditions necessary for reimbursement.



Title Held by Financial Institution



This amendment modifies the FTR to allow an employee to be reimbursed for the sale or purchase of real property when
title to the property is held by a financial institution pursuant to state financing laws. Some states require that
lenders take title to real property in order to perfect (i.e., protect) the lender's security interest. Other states
require the lender to record a lien against the title in the residence records to perfect the lender's security interest.
This amendment ensures equal treatment for employees who enter into a financing arrangement (e.g., a mortgage) for
real property and who offer the real property as security for the financing arrangement.



Accommodation Parties



This amendment modifies the FTR to allow an employee to be reimbursed for the sale or purchase of real property when
the name of an accommodation party appears on the title document. An accommodation party is an individual who signs
an employee's financing arrangement (e.g., a mortgage) to lend his/her name (i.e., credit) to the arrangement. Such
an individual is a surety, becoming responsible for the payments should the employee not perform, but the individual
has no beneficial interest in the property as long as the arrangement is not in default.



Financing Arrangements with the Seller of the Property 




This amendment modifies the FTR to allow an employee to be reimbursed for the sale or purchase of real property when
the title is held in the name of the seller of the property pursuant to a financing arrangement (e.g., land contract)
providing for fixed periodic payments and transfer of title to the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family
upon completion of the payment schedule. Previously, this was allowed by CG decision (B-200207, September
29, 1981).




Other Equitable Title Situations



There are situations other than those listed above in which an employee can demonstrate that he/she has equitable
title based on the following criteria: only the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family has made payments
on the residence, and the employee and/or a member(s) of the immediate family must have received all proceeds from
the sale of the property. This amendment modifies the FTR to authorize reimbursement to an employee for the sale of
real property in ``other equitable title situations'' meeting these criteria. More extensive documentation requirements
enumerated within the amendment apply when this general ``other equitable title situations'' provision is used.
When both the general provision and one of the specific equitable title provisions apply, reimbursement to the employee
will be covered under the specific provision instead of the general provision. 


This amendment adds language to the section in part 1 of chapter 302 that addresses ``applicability'' to clarify that
chapter 302 covers ``last move home'' benefits for career appointees to the Senior Executive Service (SES) and prior
SES appointees who have elected to retain their SES retirement benefits. This amendment also makes certain editorial
and technical corrections. GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes
of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993.

Fellowship Program Requirements




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The following are the regulations governing the annual competition for James Madison Fellowships and the obligations
of James Madison Fellows. They replace the Foundation's former rule published in the 

Federal Register 

on March 2, 1992 (57 FR 7321-7326), which implemented the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act of 1986. These
revised regulations govern the qualifications and applications of candidates for fellowships; the selection of
Fellows by the Foundation; the graduate programs Fellows must pursue; the conditions attached to awards; the Foundation's
annual Summer Institute on the Constitution; and related requirements and expectations regarding fellowships.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This rule exactly reproduces the text of the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16585). Since only one comment to that proposed rule was received and that one without substantive
suggestions, no alteration in the proposed rule is required.




The James Madison Memorial Fellowship Act authorizes fellowship support for graduate study by teachers of American
history and social studies and by college seniors or college graduates who wish to become teachers of the same subjects.
However, in order not to exclude from consideration for James Madison Fellowships those teachers or would-be teachers
whose current or future secondary school instruction, while concerning the usual subjects covered by courses in
American history and social studies, may be carried on in courses entitled ``government'' or similar names, this
rule, like the former rule, goes beyond the Act to apply to those teachers and would-be teachers who do or will offer
secondary school instruction in American government.

Subpart A_General



 2400.1



Purposes.



(a) The purposes of the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Program are to:

(1) Provide incentives for master's degree level graduate study of the history, principles, and development of the
United States Constitution by outstanding in-service teachers of American history, American government, and social
studies in grades 7-12 and by outstanding college graduates who plan to become teachers of the same subjects;
and thereby to

(2) Strengthen teaching in the nation's secondary schools about the principles, framing, ratification, and subsequent
history of the United States Constitution.

(b) The Foundation may from time to time operate its own programs and undertake other closely related activities to
fulfill these goals.



 2400.2



Annual competition.



To achieve its principal purposes, the Foundation holds an annual competition to select teachers in grades 7-12,
college seniors, and college graduates to be James Madison Fellows.



 2400.3



Eligibility.



Individuals eligible to apply for and hold James Madison Fellowships are United States citizens, United States nationals,
or permanent residents of the Northern Mariana Islands who are:

(a) Teachers of American history, American government, or social studies in grades 7-12 who:

(1) Are teaching full time during the year in which they apply for a fellowship;

(2) Are under contract, or can provide evidence of being under prospective contract, to teach full time as teachers
of American history, American government, or social studies in grades 7-12;

(3) Have demonstrated records of willingness to devote themselves to civic responsibilities and to professional
and collegial activities within their schools and school districts;

(4) Are highly recommended by their department heads, school heads, school district superintendents, or other supervisors;

(5) Qualify for admission with graduate standing at accredited universities of their choice that offer master's
degree programs allowing at least 12 hours or their equivalent of study of the origins, principles, and development
of the Constitution of the United States and of its comparison with the constitutions of other forms of government;

(6) Are able to complete their proposed courses of graduate study within five calendar years from the commencement
of study under their fellowships, normally through part-time study during summers or in evening or weekend programs;

(7) Agree to attend the Foundation's four-week Summer Institute on the Constitution, normally during the summer
following the commencement of study under their fellowships; and

(8) Sign agreements that, after completing the education for which the fellowship is awarded, they will teach American
history, American government, or social studies full time in secondary schools for a period of not less than one year
for each full academic year of study for which assistance was received, preferably in the state listed as their legal
residence at the time of their fellowship award. For the purposes of this provision, a full academic year of study is
the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year
of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when
Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to
determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.

(b) Those who aspire to become full-time teachers of American history, American government, or social studies in
grades 7-12 who:

(1) Are matriculated college seniors pursuing their baccalaureate degrees full time and will receive those degrees
no later than August 31st of the year of the fellowship competition in which they apply or prior recipients of baccalaureate
degrees;

study of American history and government and with their serious intention to enter the teaching profession as secondary
school teachers of American history, American government, or social studies in grades 7-12;

(5) Qualify for admission with graduate standing at accredited universities of their choice that offer master's
degree programs that allow at least 12 hours or their equivalent of study of the origins, principles, and development
of the Constitution of the United States and of its comparison with the constitutions and history of other forms of
government;

(6) Are able to complete their proposed courses of graduate study in no more than two calendar years from the commencement
of study under their fellowships, normally through full-time study;

(7) Agree to attend the Foundation's four-week Summer Institute on the Constitution, normally during the summer
following the commencement of study under their fellowships; and

(8) Sign an agreement that, after completing the education for which the fellowship is awarded, they will teach American
history, American government, or social studies full time in secondary schools for a period of not less than one year
for each full academic year of study for which assistance was received, preferably in the state listed as their legal
residence at the time of their fellowship award. For the purposes of this provision, a full academic year of study is
the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year
of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when
Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to
determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.

Institutions of graduate study.



Fellowship recipients may attend any accredited university in the United States with a master's degree program offering
courses or training that emphasize the origins, principles, and development of the Constitution of the United States
and its comparison with the constitutions and history of other forms of government.



 2400.41



Degree programs.



(a) Fellows may pursue a master's degree in history or political science (including government or politics), the
degree of Master of Arts in Teaching in history or political science (including government or politics), or a related
master's degree in education that permits a concentration in American history, American government, or social studies.
Graduate degrees under which study is excluded from fellowship support are indicated in  2400.64.

(b) A master's degree pursued under a James Madison Fellowship may entail either one or two years or their equivalent
of study, according to the requirements of the university at which a Fellow is enrolled.



 2400.42



Approval of programs.



The Foundation must approve each Fellow's program of graduate study. To be approved, the program must_

(a) On a part-time or full-time basis lead to a master's degree in history or political science, the degree of Master
of Arts in Teaching in history or political science, or a related master's degree in education that permits a concentration
in American history, American government, or social studies;

(b) Include courses, graduate seminars, or opportunities for independent study in topics directly related to the
framing and history of the constitution of the United States;

(c) Be pursued at a university that assures a willingness to accept up to 6 semester hours of accredited transfer credits
from another graduate institution for a Fellow's satisfactory completion of the Foundation's Summer Institute
on the Constitution. For the Foundation's purposes, these 6 semester hours may be included in the required minimum
of 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the United States Constitution; and

(d) Be pursued at a university that encourages the Fellow to enhance his or her capacities as a teacher of American history,
American government, or social studies and to continue his or her career as a secondary school teacher. The Foundation
reserves the right to refuse to approve a Fellow's degree program at a university that will not accept on transfer the
6 credits for the Institute.

Required courses of graduate study.



(a) To be acceptable to the Foundation, those courses related to the Constitution referred to in  2400.43(b)
must amount to at least 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of topics directly related to the United States
Constitution. More than 12 hours or their equivalent of such study is strongly encouraged.

(b) The courses that fulfill the required minimum of 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the United States
Constitution must cover one or more of the following subject areas:

(1) The history of colonial America leading up to the framing of the Constitution;

(2) The Constitution itself, its framing, the history and principles upon which it is based, its ratification, the
Federalist Papers, Anti-Federalist writings, and the Bill of Rights;

(3) The historical development of political theory, constitutional law, and civil liberties as related to the Constitution;

(4) Interpretations of the Constitution by the Supreme Court and other branches of the federal government;

<TEXT>
 

(c) If a master's degree program in which a Fellow is enrolled offers the option of a master's thesis in place of a course
or courses, the Fellow will be strongly urged to write a thesis. If the preparation of a master's thesis adds additional
required credits to the minimum number of credits required for the master's degree, the Foundation will pay for these
additional credits. In all programs in which a master's degree thesis is required or elected as an option, a Fellow
must write the thesis in a subject concerning the framing, principles, or history of the United States Constitution.



 2400.44


Commencement of graduate study.



(a) Fellows may commence study under their fellowships as early as the summer following the announcement of their
award. Fellows are normally expected to commence study under their fellowships in the fall term of the academic year
following the date on which their award is announced. However, as indicated in  2400.62, they may seek to postpone
the commencement of fellowship study under extenuating circumstances.

(b) In determining the two- and five-year fellowship periods of Junior and Senior Fellows respectively, the Foundation
will consider the commencement of the fellowship period to be the date on which each Fellow commences study under a
fellowship.



 2400.45


Special consideration: Junior Fellows' courses of study.



Applicants for junior fellowships who seek or hold baccalaureate degrees in education are strongly encouraged to
pursue master's degrees in history or political science. Those applicants who hold undergraduate degrees in history,
political science, government, or any other subjects may take some teaching methods and related courses, although
the Foundation will not pay for them unless they are required for the degree for which the Fellow is matriculated. The
Foundation will review each proposed course of study for an appropriate balance of subject matter and other courses
based on the Fellow's goals, background, and degree requirements.



 2400.46


Special consideration: second master's degree.



The Foundation may award senior fellowships to applicants who are seeking their second master's degrees providing
that the applicants' first master's degrees were obtained at least five years prior to the year in which the applicants
would normally commence study under a fellowship. In evaluating applications from those intending to pursue a second
master's degree, the Fellow Selection Committee will favor those applicants who are planning to become American
history and social studies teachers after having taught another subject and those whose initial master's degree
was in a subject different from that sought under the second master's degree.



Subpart F_Fellowship Stipends



 2400.50


Amount of stipends.



Junior and senior fellowships carry a stipend of up to a maximum of $24,000 prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate
study. In no case shall the stipend for a fellowship exceed $12,000 per academic year. Within this limit, stipends
will be prorated over the period of Fellows' graduate study as follows: a maximum of $6,000 per academic semester or
trimester of full-time study, and a maximum of $4,000 per academic quarter of full-time study. Stipends for part-time
study will be pro rata shares of those allowable for full-time study.



 2400.51


Duration of stipends.



Stipends for junior fellowships may be payable over a period up to two calendar years of full-time graduate study,
and those for senior fellowships may be payable over a period of not more than five calendar years of part-time graduate
study, commencing with the dates under which Fellows commence their graduate study under their fellowships. However,
the duration of stipend payments will be subject to limitations indicated in  2400.61.

<TEXT>
 

 2400.52

Use of stipends.


Stipends shall be used only to offset the costs of tuition, fees, books, room, and board associated with graduate study
under a fellowship. The costs allowed for a Fellow's room and board will be the amount the Fellow's university reports
to the Foundation as the cost of room and board for a graduate student if that student were to share a room at the student's
university. If no graduate housing exists, then costs for regular shared student housing will be used. If no campus
housing exists, the equivalent room and board costs at neighboring universities will be used. Stipends for room,
board, and books will be prorated for Fellows enrolled in programs less than full time. The Foundation will not reimburse
Fellows for any portion of their master's degree study, if any, that Fellows may have completed prior to the commencement
of their fellowships. Nor will the Foundation reimburse Fellows for any credits acquired above the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. If a Fellow has already taken and paid for courses that can be credited toward the
Fellow's graduate degree under a fellowship, those must be credited to the degree; the remaining required courses
will be paid for by the Foundation.


 2400.53

Certification for stipends.


In order to receive a fellowship stipend, a Fellow must submit in writing acceptance of the terms and conditions of
the fellowship; evidence of admission to an approved graduate program; certified copies of undergraduate and, if
any, graduate transcripts; a certified payment request form indicating estimated expenses for tuition, fees, books,
room, and board; estimated income from any other grants or awards; information about the Fellow's degree program,
including the number of required credits and the availability of a thesis option; a statement of the university's
willingness to accept the transfer of 6 credits toward the Fellow's degree requirements for the Fellow's satisfactory
completion of the Summer Institute (see  2400.74); and a full plan of study over the duration of the fellowship,
including information on the contents of required courses. Junior Fellows must provide evidence of receipt of their
baccalaureate degrees, and Senior Fellows must provide evidence of their continued full-time employment as teachers
in grades 7-12.


 2400.54

Payment of stipends.


Payment for tuition, fees, books, room, and board subject to the limitations in   2400.50 through 2400.53
and   2400.60 through 2400.61 will be paid to each Fellow at the beginning of each term of enrollment upon
the Fellow's submission of a completed Payment Request Form provided by the Foundation.


 2400.55

Termination of stipends.


The Foundation may suspend or terminate the payment of a stipend if a Fellow fails to meet the criteria set forth in   2400.40
through 2400.44 and  2400.61, except as provided for in  2400.62. Before it suspends or terminates a fellowship
under these circumstances, the Foundation will give notice to the Fellow, as well as the opportunity to be heard with
respect to the grounds for suspension or termination.


 2400.56

Repayment of stipends.


(a) If a Fellow fails to secure a master's degree, to teach American history, American government, or social studies
on a full-time basis in a secondary school for at least one school year for each academic year for which assistance was
provided under a fellowship, to secure no fewer than 12 credits for study of the Constitution as indicated in  2400.43(b),
or to attend the Foundation's Summer Institute on the Constitution, the Fellow shall repay all of the fellowship assistance
received plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum or as otherwise authorized and, if applicable, reasonable collection
fees, as prescribed in Section 807 of the Act (20 U.S.C. 4506(b)).
(b) If a Fellow resigns a fellowship, the Foundation will seek to recover all fellowship funds which have been remitted
to the Fellow under a fellowship.


Subpart G_Special Conditions


 2400.60

Other awards.


Fellows may accept grants from other foundations, institutions, corporations, or government agencies to support
their graduate study or to replace any income foregone for study. However, the stipend paid by the Foundation for allowable
costs indicated in  2400.52 will be reduced to the extent these costs are paid from other sources, and in no case
will fellowship funds be paid to Fellows to provide support in excess of their actual total costs of tuition, required
fees, books, room, and board. The Foundation may also reduce a Fellow's stipend if the Fellow is remunerated for the
costs of tuition under a research or teaching assistantship or a work-study program. In such a case, the Foundation
will require information from a Fellow's university about the intended use of assistantship or work-study support
before remitting fellowship payments.

 2400.61

Renewal of awards.



(a) Provided that Fellows have submitted all required documentation, it is the intent of the Foundation to renew junior
fellowship awards annually for a period not to exceed two calendar years and senior fellowships for a period not to
exceed five calendar years (except when those periods have been altered because of changes in Fellows' programs of
studies as provided for in  2400.65), or until a Fellow has completed all requirements for a master's degree,
whichever comes first. In no case, however, will the Foundation continue payments under a fellowship to a Fellow who
has reached the maximum payments under a fellowship as indicated in  2400.50, or completed the minimum number
of credits required for the degree. Although Fellows are encouraged to take courses in addition to those required
for the degree or required to maintain full-time status, the Foundation will not in such cases pay for those additional
courses unless they are credited to the minimum number of credits required for the degree.

(b) Fellowship renewal will be subject to an annual review by the Foundation and certification by an authorized official
of the university at which a Fellow is registered that:




The Fellow is making satisfactory progress toward the degree and is in good academic standing according to the standards
of each university.




(c) As a condition of renewal of awards, each Fellow must submit an annual activity report to the Foundation by July
15th. That report must indicate, through submission of a copy of the Fellow's transcript, courses taken and grades
achieved; courses planned for the coming year; changes in academic or professional plans or situations; any awards,
recognitions, or special achievements in the Fellow's academic study or school employment; and such other information
as may relate to the fellowship and its holder. Fellows must also submit a final report to the Foundation following
completion of their fellowships.



 2400.62

Postponement of awards.



Upon application to the Foundation, a Fellow may seek postponement of his or her fellowship because of ill health or
other mitigating circumstances, such as military duty, temporary disability, necessary care of an immediate family
member, or unemployment as a teacher. Substantiation of the reasons for the requested postponement of study will
be required.



 2400.63

Evidence of master's degree.



At the conclusion of the fellowship term, each Fellow must provide evidence that he or she has secured an approved master's
degree as set forth in the Fellow's original plan of study/or approved modifications thereto.



 2400.64

Excluded graduate study.



(a) James Madison Fellowships do not provide support for study toward doctoral degrees, for the degree of master of
arts in public affairs or public administration, or toward the award of teaching certificates. Nor do fellowships
support practice teaching required for professional certification or other courses related to teaching unless
those courses are required for the degree. In those cases, however, the Foundation will provide reimbursement only
toward those courses related to teaching that fall within the minimum number of courses required for the degree, not
in addition to that minimum.

(b) If a course or courses required toward a Fellow's master's degree are coincidentally credited toward a Fellow's
future doctoral degree or teaching certificate, the Foundation will provide reimbursement toward that course or
those courses. Such reimbursement will be governed by all other rules, requirements, and obligations set forth in
subparts E through G.



 2400.65

Alteration of plans of study.



Although Junior Fellows are expected to pursue full-time study and Senior Fellows to pursue part-time study, the
Foundation may permit Junior Fellows with an established need (such as the need to accept a teaching position) to study
part time and Senior Fellows with established need (such as great distance between the Fellow's residence and the
nearest university, thus necessitating a full-time leave of absence from employment in order to study) to study full
time.



 2400.66

foregone by their required attendance. The Foundation also funds the costs of the Institute and Fellows' round-trip
transportation to and from the Institute site. The costs of tuition, required fees, books, room, and board entailed
by the Institute will be paid for by the Foundation directly but may be offset against fellowship award limits if the
credits earned for the Institute are included within the Fellows' degree requirements.


 2400.74



Institute accreditation.


The Institute is accredited for six graduate credits by the university at which it is held. It is expected that the universities
at which Fellows are pursuing their graduate study will, upon Fellows' satisfactory completion of the Institute,
accept these credits upon transfer from the university at which the Institute is held in fulfillment of the minimum
number of credits required for Fellows' graduate degrees. Satisfactory completion of the Institute will fulfill
six of the Foundation's 12 credits of required graduate study of the history and development of the Constitution.
Fellows, with the Foundation's assistance, are strongly encouraged to make good faith efforts to have their universities
incorporate the Institute into their course programs and accept the 6 Institute credits toward the minimum number
of credits required for their master's degrees.

I. Introduction



1. On October 26, 1993, the Federal-State Alaska Joint Board (Board) adopted the Final Recommended Decision in CC
Docket 83-1376.
 The Final Recommended Decision presents a carefully integrated plan to meet the five objectives that it recommends
should govern interstate telecommunications services between Alaska and the contiguous states (``Lower 48'')
and between Alaska and Hawaii. We hereby adopt these five objectives and agree with the Joint Board that, based on the
record, the Final Recommended Decision best achieves these five objectives: preservation of universal service;
continuation of rate integration;
 maintenance of revenue requirement neutrality;
 allowance of market-based competitive entry; and encouragement of increased efficiency.







2. We also conclude that implementation of the new market structure recommended by the Board will increase competition
and will further economic growth in Alaska by lowering prices and stimulating demand for telecommunications services.
Economic growth will be enhanced because the new market structure will stimulate, through lower prices, and facilitate,
through new services, transactions between consumers and businesses in the state of Alaska and the rest of the nation.
Increased competition should also encourage additional investment in the Alaska telecommunications infrastructure.
Under this new market structure, we conclude that businesses and consumers can enjoy these benefits at the same time
we preserve universal service, revenue requirement neutrality, and rate integration. In this order we thus adopt,
with clarifications and minor modifications, the recommendations of the Board and establish implementation requirements.



II. Summary of the Final Recommended Decision



3. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Board concluded that the Joint Services Arrangement (JSA) should be terminated,
subject to the adoption and implementation of suitable transition mechanisms.
 Under the recommended market structure, the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (AT&T) would provide MTS
services between Alaska and the Lower 48 (northbound and southbound), and between Alaska and Hawaii, at integrated
rates and under the terms and conditions applicable to AT&T's provision of services in the Lower 48. After the
JSA terminates, Alascom, Inc. (Alascom) could offer interstate MTS independently from AT&T under its own tariff
and with no obligation to charge AT&T's integrated rates.





4. Under the Final Recommended Decision, Alascom would provide interexchange carriers (IXCs) common carrier services
under tariff offered on a non-discriminatory basis at rates that reflect the costs of services.
 Alascom's tariff would have separate rate schedules for locations subject to facilities competition (non-Bush)
and for locations where Alascom has a facilities monopoly (Bush). The costs of service in each of these categories
would be defined pursuant to a cost allocation plan developed by Alascom and approved by the Commission.





5. The Final Recommended Decision also contemplates that Alascom would continue to provide interstate private line
service upon reasonable request under its existing federal tariffing and Section 214 obligations. If AT&T provides
interstate private line service to or from Alaska, it would be required to do so under the same rate structures, terms,
and conditions that apply to its provision of private line services between other states.

6. The Board recommended a four-year transition period, beginning March 1, 1994. During the transition, AT&T
would be required to purchase certain services from Alascom to meet its MTS obligations. There would be two phases
to the transition period, with the first phase beginning on March 1, 1994, and the second phase beginning on September
1, 1995. During the first phase, AT&T would continue to obtain services from Alascom under the JSA for one and one-half
years. On September 1, 1995, the JSA would terminate and Alascom's common carrier services would be offered to carrier
customers under tariff. During the second phase of the transition period, lasting two and one-half years, AT&T
would be required to purchase a fixed amount of common carrier service from Alascom, defined as a percentage of a baseline
revenue level. This obligation would decline to zero at the end of the second phase.

7. Finally, under the Final Recommended Decision, AT&T would make a $150 million transition payment (in two installments
of $75 million each) to Alascom that would be applied to reduce Alascom's total plant accounts.






III. Commission Adoption of the Alaska Joint Board's Final Recommended Decision



8. The Commission has wrestled for over 20 years with the question of what type of telecommunications structure for
Alaska would best serve the public interest.
 Over this time period there have been significant changes in the domestic telecommunications market in terms of the
number of carriers that provide interstate service, the types of services they provide, and the technologies they
use to provide telecommunications services. While these changes have been occurring nationally, the Commission
has continued to search for the market structure that will best meet the needs of Alaskan consumers of telecommunications
services, incorporate into Alaska telecommunications the changes that have occurred nationally, and harmonize
rate integration, competitive policies, and universal service objectives in Alaska. 





9. In 1985, the Commission referred questions concerning the appropriate market structure for providing Alaska
MTS to a Federal-State Alaska Joint Board created pursuant to Section 410(c) of the Communications Act. These questions
have been under review by the Board for over eight years. The Board has collected vast quantities of data, received
extensive comments from interested parties, reviewed numerous proposals on this subject, and held a public hearing.
The Final Recommended Decision sets forth the market structure plan for Alaska that the Board believes best balances
its five public interest goals. We conclude that this new market structure will allow Alaskan telecommunications
consumers to derive benefits from the changes in telecommunications services that have occurred over the last twenty
years. We concur with the Board's evaluation of the record, and the legal and policy analyses and recommendations
that are presented in the Final Recommended Decision.

10. We agree with the legal analysis in the Final Recommended Decision that concludes that we have ample authority
under the Communications Act to implement the Board's specific transition mechanisms.
 We conclude that, based on the record, the Board's recommendations, with modifications and clarifications in this
order, are in the public interest as expressed in Sections 1, 201, and 202 of the Communications Act, because they provide
a comprehensive solution to the market structure issues referred to the Board and because they best achieve the five
objectives the Board adopted earlier and that we adopt in this Order. We conclude that the new market structure, and
the transition mechanisms included as part of the comprehensive solution, are essential elements to that overall
plan of ensuring universal service for Alaska consumers, consistent with the Communications Act and the Alaska Joint
Board's Final Recommended Decision.

11. We conclude that the resulting market structure will enhance competition, thereby increasing the availability
of new services at lower prices for Alaska telecommunication consumers. We conclude that more of the benefits that
consumers have derived from competition in the Lower 48 should be available to Alaskans. Competitive markets encourage
carriers to adopt new technologies, develop new and innovative services, reduce costs by eliminating waste, provide
service more efficiently, and improve customer service. Increased competition should ensure that there is continuing
investment in the telecommunication infrastructure for Alaska both for existing and new services.

12. Although the Alaska MTS market was open to competition in 1982,
 we believe that because of limitations created by the JSA the present market structure does not produce all the benefits
available from a competitive market.
 AT&T, a major competitor in the MTS market, is unable to build facilities in Alaska or serve Alaska independently
because of the requirements of the JSA. AT&T may not take advantage of offerings of other carriers and must instead
purchase all of its Alaska switching and transport services from Alascom. Alascom gains a competitive advantage
because it has an assured revenue source, AT&T, that must pay all of Alascom's interstate costs, plus AT&T's
own rate of return (under price cap regulation) regardless of Alascom's efficiency or market conditions.
 Thus, the JSA makes it more difficult for carriers other than Alascom to compete effectively in Alaska.
 The JSA also diminishes some of the rigor of a competitive market that would otherwise encourage Alascom to eliminate
any potential waste and service inefficiencies. We conclude that the market structure in Alaska should be restructured
to promote more competition, open entry, and improve efficiency subject to transition mechanisms that will enable
the new market structure to develop without causing significant rate increases in Alaska. Accordingly, in this order,
pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i)-(j), 201-203, 214, and 220 of the Communications Act,
 we adopt the Board's Final Recommended Decision with clarifications and minor modifications and establish dates
for some of the implementation requirements.

IV. Modifications to, and Clarifications of, the Recommendations in the Final Recommended Decision


13. After reviewing the Final Recommended Decision, we have concluded that we must modify and clarify our understanding
of some of the Joint Board's recommendations to ensure that the new market structure will operate in the public interest.
In our judgment, these clarifications and modifications are consistent with the objectives established by the Board
and are consistent with the reasoning contained in the Final Recommended Decision.
 The State Joint Board Members have participated in the deliberations on this order, pursuant to Section 410(c) of
the Communications Act.




A. Transition Payment and Reduction of Alascom Plant Accounts


14. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Joint Board recommended that in applying the transition payment installments,
the ``Central Office Switching'' Account 2210 should be designated first for reduction and then should be reduced
by an amount that would result in little or no intrastate cost shift if AT&T decreased its usage of Alascom switches.
 Consistent with the Joint Board's objective of reducing Alascom's plant balances to reduce potential intrastate
cost shifts, we clarify that the amount necessary to reduce Central Office Switching so as to produce little or no increase
in intrastate revenue requirements be taken entirely from the first $75 million installment. The remaining depreciable
accounts will be reduced proportionately using both the balance of the first installment and all of the second $75
million installment. As a result, the potential for significant intrastate cost shifts if AT&T decreases its
usage of Alascom switches will be significantly diminished at the time of the first installment.





15. The Final Recommended Decision did not consider how AT&T will account for the $150 million payment to Alascom.
We conclude that the cost increase associated with the payment made by AT&T to Alascom is an extraordinary cost
beyond the control of AT&T that is eligible for exogenous treatment under  61.44(c)(5) of our price cap
rules,
 and direct AT&T to make preliminary filings forty-five days prior to filing tariff modifications that reflect
AT&T's transition payment. AT&T shall include in its tariff filings the apportionment and explanation
of the exogenous revenue requirement effects of each payment upon each rate that AT&T proposes to modify as a consequence
of this decision, and shall also include in that filing the anticipated cost reduction associated with the termination
of the JSA.





B. AT&T's Purchase of Alascom's Services


16. The Board recommended that during the second phase of the transition AT&T should be obligated to purchase
a fixed dollar amount of service from Alascom. The fixed dollar amount of service would decline in six month increments
until it reached zero at the termination of the second phase of the transition period. The Board recommended this continuing
obligation after the JSA terminates to avoid precipitous intrastate cost shifts if AT&T does not continue to
purchase Alascom services. The Board concluded that the AT&T must purchase requirement along with other transition
mechanisms will maintain the goals of universal service and revenue neutrality. We adopt these goals and the approach
recommended by the Board, but conclude that the fixed dollar amount AT&T must purchase as calculated using the
Board's methodology must be adjusted as discussed below.
17. In the Final Recommended Decision the Board recommended the following methodology for calculating the fixed
dollar amount of service that AT&T must purchase during the second phase of the transition period. The amount
that AT&T must purchase for each period of the second phase was to be computed by applying a declining percentage
for each six month period to a baseline revenue amount. The annual baseline revenue amount was to be calculated as a
function of the demand for interstate transport and switching MTS minutes for the last 12 months that the JSA was in
effect, multiplied by the new tariff rates for Alascom's Common Carrier Services.
 The percentage used to calculate the fixed dollar amount of service for each six month period was to decline to zero
in six month increments.
 The required percentage for each six month period was to be applied to one-half of the annual revenue baseline to calculate
the fixed dollar amount of services AT&T must purchase for each six month period.





18. AT&T states that the must-purchase requirement ``would require AT&T to pay for services which it may
not be able to use.''
 AT&T argues that the only way to interpret the must-purchase requirement in the Final Recommended Decision is
to equate the demand used to calculate the annual baseline revenue with the AT&T demand for interstate services
for which AT&T bills pursuant to its own tariffs during the last 12 months of the JSA. Alascom argues that the Board
intended the demand calculations to be based on the jointly provided services provided by both AT&T and Alascom.

19. We conclude that the must-purchase requirement applies to the total demand to and from Alaska under the JSA for
interstate transport and switching MTS minutes for the last 12 months that the JSA was in effect rather than just AT&T's
demand under the JSA. The Alaska Joint Board recommended a continuing obligation for AT&T to purchase some services
from Alascom during the second phase of the transition to avoid precipitous shifts of Alascom's costs to the intrastate
jurisdiction after termination of the JSA that could result from a sudden decrease in the use of Alascom facilities
by AT&T for the provision of interstate MTS.

20. We conclude, however, that we should modify the Board's recommendation in this area in two respects in order to
achieve the Board's objectives. We modify the method of calculating the fixed dollar amount of services that AT&T
must purchase in order to address factors that the Board did not consider when it selected its recommended methodology.
Without the modification we now make, the fixed dollar amount that AT&T must purchase could give Alascom windfall
payments over and above what is necessary to address the Board's concern about possible intrastate cost shifts. As
noted 

supra, 

the State Joint Board members have participated in reaching this conclusion. Thus, we require two adjustments to
the fixed dollar amount that AT&T must purchase that is calculated using the Board's recommended methodology.

21. First, intrastate cost shifts are not likely to occur if Alascom separately provides significant interstate
traffic after the JSA is terminated. Indeed, in these circumstances, AT&T may not be able to purchase the required
fixed dollar amount of services from Alascom to fulfill the recommended post-JSA traffic loading requirement. Since
in this case Alascom's use of its own facilities will help address the Board's concern about intrastate shifts, the
fixed dollar amount that AT&T must purchase for each six month period should be adjusted to reflect Alascom and
AT&T's relative interstate use of those facilities. Thus, the fixed dollar amount for each six month period during
which AT&T must purchase services from Alascom, as calculated using the Board's recommended methodology, must
be adjusted to reflect the proportion of minutes of interstate use by Alascom and AT&T.






22. Second, after the JSA terminates, Alascom likely will be obtaining revenues under tariff or through leases from
carriers for use of its facilities to provide interstate MTS. The revenues associated with new services purchased
by other interexchange carriers must be deducted from AT&T's obligation to purchase Alascom services.
 This deduction recognizes that new uses of Alascom's facilities by other interexchange carries (for the provision
of MTS services) achieves the same policy goals as similar purchases made by AT&T. Thus, the total of all MTS-related
purchases by AT&T and new services purchased by other carriers when added together must meet the fixed obligation
identified in the ``must purchase requirement.
 Again, actual interstate use of Alascom's facilities addresses the Board's concerns about intrastate cost shifts.
Additional payments would unnecessarily burden AT&T and provide Alascom with revenues over and above that needed
to address these concerns. Thus, the AT&T purchase level as calculated using the Board's recommended methodology,
and as adjusted for the proportion of MTS minutes provided by AT&T and Alascom, must be adjusted also for any revenues
received by Alascom for new services purchased by other interexchange carriers for use of its interstate MTS facilities
to provide interstate MTS.

C. Alascom's Common Carrier Tariff



23. The Final Recommended Decision stated that Alascom should be required to file a common carrier services tariff
with two geographic rate zones. To implement this recommendation, we establish filing dates and other requirements.
In order to process Alascom's common carrier services tariff by the required effective date, we require that Alascom
file its tariff and cost support information
 120 days before the scheduled effective date for that tariff of January 1, 1996, because a lawful tariff must be on file
prior to termination of the JSA.
 The tariff must be revised annually thereafter on the schedule set forth in Section 69.3(a) of the Commission's Rules.








24. The Final Recommended Decision did not recommend a rate of return that Alascom should use in computing a revenue
requirement for the common carrier service tariff.
 We conclude in this order that for purposes of computing the revenue requirement for Alascom's common carrier tariff,
Alascom shall use the authorized interstate rate of return applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) unless Alascom,
by clear and convincing evidence, is able to justify a different rate of return for its interstate operations.







D. Other Modifications and Clarifications



25. AT&T has been providing interstate service to and from Alaska at integrated rates in conjunction with Alascom
under the JSA. The Commission requires AT&T to provide interstate MTS service at integrated rates pursuant to
the Commission's rate integration policy and sections 201(a) and 4(i) of the Communications Act. In the Final Recommended
Decision, the Alaska Joint Board recommended that AT&T be required to provide interstate service to and from
Alaska after the JSA is terminated. In this order, we adopt that recommendation and require that after the JSA is terminated,
AT&T must provide interstate service at integrated rates to and from Alaska under the same terms and conditions,
including service quality, technical standards, and availability, that it provides those services in the Lower
48 states. The Alaska Joint Board did not, however, address AT&T's potential need to request equal access from
Alaska LECs. With the termination of the JSA, AT&T will directly provide service to subscribers in Alaska. AT&T
does not currently have the same type of access to LECs in Alaska as it did in the Lower 48 when equal access was implemented,
since it has been providing service to the customers of Alaskan LECs only through Alascom's facilities. In the Lower
48, because AT&T already had ``equal access'' to the LECs, the Commission required LECs to implement equal access
only in response to requests from other interexchange carriers.
 We conclude that, because in Alaska AT&T does not have physical connections to the LECs equivalent to equal access,
LECs will have to implement equal access in response to requests from AT&T as well as in response to requests from
other interexchange carriers in Alaska.
 Accordingly, AT&T may request equal access from Alaska LECs in order to provide interstate service in Alaska.
The ability to request equal access will ensure that AT&T has more flexibility in providing service in Alaska.

<TEXT>
 

26. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Board stated, in support of its recommendation to retain the frozen circuit
equipment allocation factor, that the factor at issue applies equally to AT&T and Alascom.
 We clarify here that the frozen factor development procedures shown in Section 36.126(d)(3) of the Commission's
rules do apply equally to AT&T and Alascom because they are both interexchange, not exchange, carriers.
 However, the actual calculated frozen factor is not the same for each carrier because it is based on carrier-specific
usage data.







27. The State of Hawaii cites various portions of the Final Recommended Decision as conflicting with Commission orders
on rate integration.
 We clarify in response to concerns of the State of Hawaii that in this order we do not adopt any change in definition of
rate integration or its applicability, as required in prior Commission orders. We merely change the market structure
by which rate integration is achieved for interstate services to and from Alaska. To eliminate any possible misunderstanding,
we also emphasize that this order only pertains to MTS services and does not include private line services.







V. Alascom's ``Opposition'' to the Final Recommended Decision




28. Alascom filed an Application for Review of the Final Recommended Decision on November 29, 1993, under Section
1.115 of the Commission's rules. AT&T and GCI argue that Section 1.115 applies to a final action taken pursuant
to delegated authority under Section 5(c) of the Communications Act and that the Alaska Joint Board's actions were
taken pursuant to Section 410(c) of the Act and do not constitute final actions taken pursuant to delegated authority.''
 We agree with AT&T and GCI that Alascom's filing is improper under Section 1.115 of our rules.
 Accordingly, we dismiss Alascom's petition.
 We, however, will address on our own motion, certain matters raised by Alascom's pleading.









29. In its pleading Alascom makes a number of charges regarding supposed substantive and procedural infirmities
in the Alaska proceeding.
 For the most part, these arguments were thoroughly discussed and rejected in the Final Recommended Decision. We incorporate
by reference the Joint Board discussion on substantive and procedural issues and, unless noted otherwise, we adopt
the Joint Board's analysis as our own. Nevertheless, we think that some of the matters raised by Alascom deserve further
attention here.







A. Alascom's Substantive Arguments




30. Alascom claims that the Board has ``elevated the policy goals of efficiency and competition,'' above other Board
objectives.
 There is no merit to Alascom's claim. First, we do not agree that efficiency and competition are lesser objectives
than the other Board objectives. As stated in the Board's Supplemental Order tentatively adopting these objectives,
``a proper resolution of the issues before us must represent a balanced effort to achieve each of these goals.
 Second, we find that the Board has balanced the five Board objectives in a manner that best serves the public interest.
The Board has addressed the efficiency and competition objectives by recommending the termination of the JSA. It
has addressed the objectives of universal service and revenue requirement neutrality by recommending several transition
mechanisms including the continuation of the JSA for the first phase of the transition period, the AT&T payment
of $150 million to Alascom, and the AT&T second phase must-purchase requirement. Thus, the Board's recommendations
will not affect the Commission's policy on rate integration for interstate MTS services for Alaska.

31. Alascom's claim that the Board must identify ``relevant, material changes of fact'' before it can ``justify radical
restructuring of the Alaska telecommunications market structure, including the termination of the JSA'' is unsupported.
It is well settled that an agency may take such action, ```either with or without a change in circumstances,'''
 as long as it supplies a ```reasoned analysis' of its decision.''
 The Joint Board has supplied a ``reasoned analysis'' for its proposal and we adopt it as our own. Moreover, we disagree
that circumstances have not changed in Alaska. This entire proceeding is a result of changes in the Alaska market:
In 1972, the rate integration policy was adopted for Alaska, in 1980, Alascom and AT&T entered into the JSA, and
in 1982, the Alaska market was opened to competition. Indeed, the Joint Board was formed for the express purpose of
addressing the harmonization of competition in Alaska with rate integration, and the proposals it makes are consistent
with that task. Thus, contrary to Alascom's claim, significant changes have occurred in the Alaska market, and Alascom's
objection is without merit. 

 




32. Alascom contends that the proposed market structure ``eliminates the foundation for the frozen allocator, destroying
any reasonable prospect to preserve revenue requirement neutrality.''
 We disagree with Alascom's arguments. First, the Board recommended retaining the frozen allocator specifically
to prevent potential intrastate cost shifts that Alascom reported in its proposed implementation plan, and which
Alascom estimates are worth approximately $30 million annually. Second, contrary to Alascom's claim that it will
not have interstate business, after termination of the JSA, Alascom will remain free to provide interstate services
independently and to supply interstate common carrier services to all other IXCs. In addition to retaining the frozen
allocator, the Board recommended the continuation of the JSA during the first phase of the transition period, a $150
million payment by AT&T to Alascom to reduce Alascom's plant accounts and the AT&T must-purchase requirement
to preserve revenue requirement neutrality. We are convinced that these recommendations as part of the Board's comprehensive
solution will preserve revenue requirement neutrality. 

 



33. In addition, we note that the Part 36 frozen allocator procedures apply to other IXCs, AT&T, and UUI, not just
Alascom. The Docket 80-286 Joint Board retained a distance sensitive allocator for the IXCs to recognize the
extent of distance sensitive circuit equipment in service for those carriers, and to avoid the substantial adverse
revenue requirement impact associated with the adoption of a nondistance sensitive allocator.
 In its Report and Order, the Commission agreed with the Docket 80-286 Joint Board's recommendation that a distance
sensitive allocator, frozen at 1985 levels, be retained for use by the IXCs.
 In addition to our concern for intrastate cost shifts, we support this Board's recommendation to leave the frozen
allocator intact recognizing the broader considerations which caused it to be retained for Alascom and other IXCs
in 1987 by another Joint Board. 

 




34. Alascom argues that universal service in the Bush is more tenuous under the Final Recommended Decision because
the Board cannot assume that AT&T would be responsible for satellite service to the Bush. Alascom further contends
that universal service in the Bush will be undermined because Alascom, not AT&T, is the only carrier that has constructed,
launched, and operated a satellite for Alaska service.
 Alascom's concern about AT&T's provision of service to the Bush appears disingenuous since this service is now,
and remains, Alascom's responsibility.
 The Board's recommendations do not address or otherwise reduce Alascom's current obligation to provide satellite
service on a monopoly basis nor do the Board's recommendations lift the Commission prohibition against construction
of earth station facilities in the Bush by companies other than Alascom. Alascom may not ignore, evade, or transfer
its responsibility to provide rural Alaska satellite service without first obtaining Commission approval under
Section 214 of the Communications Act to discontinue service. To approve a Section 214 request by Alascom to discontinue
service, the Commission would have to find that ``neither the present or future public convenience and necessity
will be adversely affected.'' Both AT&T and GCI have offered to provide service to the Bush if Alascom no longer
desires to serve as the monopoly provider to the Bush.
 However, if no other carrier was willing to assume Alascom's responsibilities to serve the Bush voluntarily, the
Commission would, pursuant to Sections 1, 201, 205, and 214 of the Communications Act, require another carrier, such
as AT&T, to provide service by satellite or other appropriate technology.

35. Alascom also incorrectly argues that replacing the JSA with the new market structure will somehow undermine its
ability to provide satellite service. We conclude that this contention is incorrect for several reasons. First,
Alascom, as the facilities-based carrier for the Bush, will be able to recover the cost of furnishing service to that
region. Other carriers must use Alascom's facilities to provide service to the Bush. As required in this order, Alascom
will tariff interstate access to the Bush separately so that related costs, including the costs of the satellite,
are borne by all interstate carriers using Alascom's Bush facilities. Second, AT&T must pay Alascom $150 million
to reduce its plant accounts. This payment will make Alascom more competitive. Third, we have retained the jurisdictional
separations frozen allocator, which would assign 86% of circuit equipment investments and expenses, including
a new satellite, to the interstate jurisdiction. Finally, we have required AT&T to purchase a fixed amount of
common carrier services from Alascom during the second phase of the transition period. Thus, Alascom has not demonstrated
that its ability to provide telecommunications service in Alaska will be undermined by the competitive environment
under the new market structure.








36. Alascom also argues that: 
(1) AT&T will not be harmed by continuing the JSA; 
(2) there will not be benefits from eliminating the JSA; 
(3) if other carriers want to provide service to and from Alaska, they have been able to do so under the current market
structure; 
(4) the Alascom ARC plan is better than the Board's recommended market structure; and; 
(5) Alascom is efficient and would be more efficient than AT&T in providing service in Alaska.
 All of these issues have been raised previously in this proceeding, and the Board has previously addressed and rejected
Alascom's arguments. We concur with the Board's interpretation of the record. The new market structure in Alaska
will enable Alascom to compete with other interstate carriers on price and service. Consumers will benefit from reduced
prices, additional providers, and new services. Additional competition in Alaska under the new market structure
will provide greater opportunity for AT&T to provide service independently, for other IXCs to take Alascom's
common carrier transport services to provide interstate service to Alaska, and for consumers to receive lower prices
and additional services than the current mandated structure under the JSA.





B. Alascom's Procedural Arguments





37. Alascom argues that the Commission erred in convening this proceeding pursuant to nonrestricted rulemaking
procedures. This was not an error. In the Final Recommended Decision the Joint Board fully explained why Alascom's
argument is not supported by the language of Section 410 or any other law.
 Since we agree completely with the Joint Board's analysis, there is no reason to repeat that discussion now.





38. Alascom also is wrong in its contention that the D.C. Circuit's decision in 

Sangamon Valley Television Corp 

v.

 USA

, 269 F.2d 221 (D.C. Cir. 1959), compels the use of the Commission's 

ex parte

 procedures applicable to restricted proceedings.
 To the extent that Sangamon Valley still is good law,
 this situation is plainly distinguishable. First, this proceeding is unlike Sangamon Valley because here the Commission
and the Joint Board had 

ex parte

 procedures in place since the inception of the rulemaking to ensure that interested parties had ample opportunity
to participate in the proceeding and to respond to all presentations made to decisionmakers.
 Thus, under the 

ex parte

 procedures used in this proceeding, all written presentations and summaries of all oral presentations that go beyond
the written comments have been placed in the public record. 

See

 47 CFR 1.1206. Over the course of this lengthy proceeding many parties, including Alascom, took advantage of these
``permit but disclose'' 

ex parte

 rules, and it is hard to see how Alascom can argue now that it was not accorded due process.







39. Second, the Alaska proceeding is not like 

Sangamon Valley

 because, as the Joint Board explained, this situation does not involve ``conflicting claims to a valuable privilege.''
While the JSA is a private contract, it was ``crafted and approved by the Commission on an interim basis.''
 Indeed, Alascom itself recognized in an earlier stage of the proceeding that the contractual arrangement was established
only as a result of Commission regulatory action implementing steps to assure that rate integration would be provided
to the Alaska interstate market.
 The JSA does not confer any particular privilege on Alascom, as Alascom's authority to serve the Alaska interstate
market is not derived therefrom. Moreover, Alascom has been on notice since the inception of this proceeding that
the cost recovery arrangement provided by AT&T under the JSA was not likely to be permanent.

<PARENT> FR940527-0-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

40. Alascom's claim that it was somehow harmed by the Joint Board's use of nonrestricted procedures is especially
curious because, at the outset of the proceeding, the Commission unequivocally put the public on notice that such
procedures would be used. As Alascom acknowledges, the 1985 Order convening the Joint Board expressly classified
the proceeding as a nonrestricted notice and comment rulemaking.
 In fact, Alascom itself has taken full advantage of the 

ex parte

 rules at every stage of the proceeding, and only now complains that it was error for the Commission and Joint Board to
employ them. One of the main purposes of providing notice of 

ex parte

 procedures at the commencement of proceedings is to obtain timely public comment on those procedures. In light of
that, we believe it was incumbent upon Alascom to voice its complaints on this process in a much more timely manner.
Alascom, however, remained silent on this issue until the eve of the Joint Board's recommendation. Accordingly,
for all of the reasons stated here and in the Final Recommended Decision, we reject Alascom's tardy claims that incorrect
procedures were used in this proceeding. 





41. Likewise, Alascom's argument that the Sunshine Act was violated has no merit. The Joint Board explained in detail
why a gathering of Joint Board members with no FCC commissioners present cannot properly be called a meeting for purposes
of the Sunshine Act.
 It also discussed why the same is true when only one FCC commissioner is in attendance, or when two FCC commissioners
attend a nondeliberative portion of a gathering.
 Since we are not faced with the various hypotheticals posited by Alascom in its Application, there is no reason to address
whether the Sunshine Act might apply in such situation.
 







42. The remainder of Alascom's contentions with regard to the Sunshine Act stem from its mistaken impression that
the FCC's 

ex parte

 rules and Sunshine ``open meeting'' rules are one and the same. The 

ex parte

 provisions, which are contained in Sections 1.1200 through 1.1216 of the Commission's rules, deal with contacts
between the public and the Commission and specify certain time periods when such contact is prohibited (e.g., the
Sunshine Agenda period). In contrast, the Sunshine rules, which appear in Section 0.601 through 0.607 of the rules,
implement the Sunshine Act and relate to the manner in which the FCC conducts its open meetings. Thus, Alascom's conclusion
is incorrect that the language in the Order convening the Joint Board providing that state commissioners be considered
FCC commissioners for purposes of the FCC's 

ex parte

 rules necessarily required Joint Board compliance with the Sunshine rules governing open meetings.
 Alascom also is incorrect that the Joint Board was subject to the open meeting rules because it stated in the Tentative
Recommendation that 

ex parte

 presentations would be permitted ``except during the Sunshine Agenda period.''
 Simply stated, the imposition of the FCC's 

ex parte

 procedures in a Joint Board proceeding would not subject the Board to the Sunshine Act's open meeting requirements.
 







43. Quoting language from the Final Recommended Decision that ``only the full Joint Board (of which the FCC Commissioners
are a minority) is authorized to make recommendations to the Commission,'' Alascom argues that the state members
acted beyond their delegated authority when they held state member-only meetings and issued data requests. Even
assuming arguendo that only the full Board may make ``recommendations'' to the FCC, it does not follow that the state
members are precluded from ``acting'' altogether. We find no basis for Alascom's conclusion that the Communications
Act or any other law prohibits the state members from conferring among themselves about Alaska issues or from asking
for information from parties to the proceeding.

44. Alascom further argues that the employment of Overland Consulting, Inc. (Overland) by the Alaska Public Utilities
Commission (APUC) was tantamount to according the private consultants of other parties to the proceeding the status
of Joint Board staff. There is no basis for this contention. At the outset, we note that just because the State of Alaska
is responsible for the APUC's funding does not mean that the APUC stands in the shoes of the State, which is a party to
this proceeding. Likewise, the APUC's payment of Overland's fees does not establish that Overland is acting on behalf
of the state commission. Therefore, even assuming 

arguendo

 that the APUC filed comments in this docket, we do not think that, in the unique context of a Joint Board proceeding,
such ``advocacy'' makes a difference.
 All of the state decision-makers on the Board are members of, and paid by, state commissions. The fact that a state commission
may also act as a party on matters within its interest (

e.g.,

 jurisdictional issues) does not mandate disqualification of the Joint Board member from that state. In contrast
to its attack on Overland, Alascom does not argue, for example, that Commissioner Knowles or other members of her staff
paid by the APUC should have been removed from the Board. For the purposes discussed herein, we see no distinction between
Overland and Commissioner Knowles and her staff. This is especially the case when Alascom fails to point to any evidence
demonstrating that the APUC controlled the activities of Overland or that Overland's actions were in any way distinguishable
from those of other persons advising Commissioner Knowles. Indeed, one of the APUC submissions cited by Alascom shows
just the opposite. In that letter, the APUC Chairman pointed out to Alascom that Overland was hired to assist Commissioner
Knowles and staff member Lorraine Kenyon in their official Joint Board duties, and that Alascom's request for Overland's
help in preparing data filings was a matter to be decided by the state members who issued the data requests, not by the
APUC. The contents of this submission establish that Commissioner Knowles, in her Joint Board capacity, rather than
the APUC or the State of Alaska, directed the activities of Overland.
 We agree with the Final Recommended Decision that Overland was not representing an interested party to the proceeding
and, therefore, its participation was not improper and did not, for example, constitute an impermissible 

ex parte

 contact.





45. Likewise, Alascom's analysis of the relevant law is faulty when it asserts that the use of Overland's services
was impermissible because the FCC itself lacks authority to hire the consultant. In fact, a number of statutory provisions
grant the Commission explicit authority for such purposes. Indeed, section 410(b) of the Communications Act permits
the FCC to accept services from a state commission. 47 U.S.C. 410(b). Likewise, section 3109 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code
(which is incorrectly cited by Alascom for the opposite proposition) often is used by the Commission to hire experts
and consultants. Moreover, the Office of Personnel Management guidelines construing section 3109 allow the Commission
to accept such services, with or without payment.
 Thus, we reject Alascom's argument that the use of Overland's services was impermissible.




46. Finally, we conclude that there was no harm to the Alaska public as a result of the July 1, 1993 public hearing in Anchorage.
As stated in the Final Recommended Decision, it is not apparent that the FCC rule regarding notice for public hearings
applies to this situation since it was a Joint Board, rather than Commission, meeting. But, even if the rule is applicable,
it is hard to see how anyone was injured. Reply comments to the hearing were accepted for almost two weeks after the meeting,
and 

ex parte

 presentations were permitted thereafter. Indeed, Alascom acknowledges that this opportunity to file comments
elicited 39 submissions from the Alaska public.
 Moreover, this proceeding has been ongoing for more than eight years, with ample opportunity for public comment at
every stage. It appears that any person with an interest in the Alaska telephone market would have had more than adequate
notice and the occasion to present his or her views on the subject long before the Final Recommended Decision was adopted
by the Joint Board.




47. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we reject Alascom's substantive and procedural arguments.

 Denial of petition for reconsideration. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document denies a petition for reconsideration from Hassel Free, Inc., a manufacturer of built-in child restraints
for vans. Petitioner sought reconsideration of a rule that specifies built-in restraints for vans are to be dynamically
tested in the specific vehicle into which the restraint is installed or in the shell of that vehicle. Standard 213 specifies
that the ``shell'' must have the features of the vehicle interior that surround a built-in restraint. Petitioner
believed that requiring the shell to have these features unduly burdens van converters. NHTSA is denying the petition
because the agency has determined that there is a safety need to test built-in restraints in vehicle shells. Further,
NHTSA is denying the petition because the agency believes that van converters are not unduly burdened.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document relates to an April 1993 rule that amended the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 213, Child Restraint Systems (49 CFR 571.213), for built-in child restraint systems.


Background


In 1988, NHTSA amended Standard 213 to apply the standard to built-in restraints, which the amendment defined as child
restraint systems which are ``an integral part of a passenger car.'' (53 FR 1783, January 22, 1988.) The amendment
specified that these restraints must limit the head and chest acceleration and knee excursion of a child test dummy
restrained in the system in a 30 mile per hour (mph) dynamic test. The amendment specified that NHTSA will test a built-in
restraint in the specific vehicle in which it has been installed or in the ``specific vehicle shell'' of such vehicle.
The amendment defined ``specific vehicle shell'' as the portion of the actual vehicle model into which the built-in
child restraint system is installed, including the complete surroundings of the built-in system. (S4 of Standard
213.) For example, S4 of Standard 213 specifies that__



If the built-in child restraint system is manufactured as part of the rear seat, these surroundings include the back
of the front seat, the interior rear side door panels and trim, the rear seat, the floor pan, the B and C pillars, and the
ceiling. * * *

 

In 1993, NHTSA amended some of the provisions relating to built-in systems. 58 FR 19776; April 16, 1993. Among other
things, it amended the definition of a built-in system to include restraints that are designed to be an integral part
of vehicles other than passenger cars. As a result of this amendment, built-in systems for vans (which are considered
``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' under NHTSA's regulations, 49 CFR 571.3) became subject to the standard's
dynamic performance requirements. Under the amendment, the built-in restraints for vans were required to restrain
test dummies seated in the restraints such that the head and chest accelerations and the knee excursion of the dummies
were within allowable limits specified in the standard. As noted above, Standard 213 already had test procedures
for testing built-in systems for passenger cars, i.e., testing in the specific vehicle or the specific vehicle shell.
The amendment applied these same procedures to built-in systems for vans. The amendment has the effect of specifying
that NHTSA is to dynamically test all built-in systems in the specific vehicle in which the restraint is installed
or the specific vehicle shell of such vehicle. 


Petition for reconsideration


NHTSA received a petition for reconsideration of the 1993 rule from Hassel Free, Inc., a manufacturer of built-in
child restraints for vans. Hassel Free earlier had commented favorably on NHTSA's notice of proposed rulemaking
that preceded the April 1993 rule. Hassel Free expressed concern in its petition about the test burdens that the compliance
test would impose on van converters, the parties to whom Hassel Free sells its built-in restraints. Petitioner said
that van converters, which are typically small businesses, lack the resources to test the built-in restraints in
the specific vehicle shell.

1

 Hassel Free believed that van converters will choose not to purchase and install built-in restraints rather than
incur the costs of testing the systems in the specific van shells. 




Petitioner suggested that instead of testing built-in restraints in the specific vehicle shell, NHTSA should test
built-in systems in a manner used to test add-on (i.e., portable) child restraints. Add-on restraints are dynamically
tested on a ``standard seat assembly'' representative of a typical vehicle seat. The standard seat assembly lacks
the features of the vehicle that are in a vehicle shell, e.g., the back of a front seat, the interior rear side door panels
and trim or the vehicle floor pan. Petitioner said it would be less costly to test a built-in restraint on a standard
seat assembly that lacked the features of the vehicle than on the specific vehicle shell with the vehicle features.
Hassel Free argued that it is unfair not to test built-in systems in the same way as add-on systems since, petitioner
believed, built-in systems are safer than add-ons:

<TEXT>
 

[B]uilt-in restraints have been demonstrated to significantly out perform add-ons. Excursion in add-ons is significantly
higher, thus making a specific vehicle shell test more significant for these restraints. 


Agency Response


The agency has decided to deny Hassel Free's petition. NHTSA disagrees with each of the arguments underlying the petition.

The first argument is that Standard 213's compliance test procedure unduly burdens built-in restraint manufacturers.
Petitioner did not dispute that dynamically testing built-in systems for vans will better ensure the safe performance
of those restraints in crashes, or question that manufacturers must bear some responsibility for ensuring that their
restraints will provide the level of crash protection required by the standard. Instead, the petitioner suggested
that NHTSA change the means of conducting the dynamic test to lessen what the petitioner believed were unnecessary
burdens on small manufacturers. 
The agency has decided against changing the test procedures after considering the nexus between the standard's performance
requirements and the laboratory compliance test. Standard 213 specifies requirements that reduce the likelihood
that, in a crash, a child using a child restraint system will be injured by the collapse or disintegration of the system,
or by contact with interior of the vehicle, or by imposition of intolerable forces by the restraint system. Standard
213's dynamic test must simulate an actual vehicle crash to ensure that these requirements are effective in protecting
the child and that the restraint will perform in the real world as it does in the laboratory. For the most accurate evaluation,
the simulation must be as representative of a real world crash as possible. 
Testing a built-in restraint in the specific vehicle shell approximates a real world crash almost as nearly as possible.
Only testing a built-in restraint in an actual vehicle provides a better approximation. The parts of the vehicle interior
that are included in the specific vehicle shell are those parts that a child positioned in the system could contact
during a frontal crash. 52 FR 9194, 9196; March 23, 1987 (NPRM to permit built-in restraints in passenger cars). Without
those parts, the representativeness of the test would be severely reduced, and the ability of the test to evaluate
the safety of a built-in system would be compromised. 
It should be noted that it is because the shell replicates the actual vehicle that Standard 213 does not specify limits
on the head excursion of the child dummy restrained in a built-in system. NHTSA determined it is unnecessary to limit
head excursion for built-in restraints if the standard limits the head acceleration of the restrained dummy and the
dummy impacts in the shell any structure that might be present in the vehicle in the real world. 

Id., 

at 9194. If features of the vehicle interior that a child could impact are not included in the apparatus that tests a
built-in restraint, an incomplete evaluation of the child seat's performance would result. That is, it would be possible
that head acceleration might be within the limits of the standard even though a child's head could strike harmful structures
in the vehicle interior in an actual crash. For these reasons, NHTSA concludes that the burden of testing a built-in
restraint in a specific vehicle shell is not undue. 
Hassel Free made other arguments with which NHTSA does not agree. Petitioner believed built-in restraints should
be tested on a standard seat assembly without the surrounding features of the vehicle interior because built-in restraints
universally outperform add-on restraints with regard to head excursion. Petitioner did not provide any information
supporting this claim. Further, the agency does not believe that a head excursion limit would be an appropriate measure
of the ability of a built-in system to provide head impact protection. A head excursion limit is unnecessary for built-in
child restraints because these restraints will be tested in the actual environment (either in the vehicle or in a vehicle
shell that replicates the actual vehicle) in which the restraint is installed in the real world, and because the testing
directly measures forces on the head of the restrained test dummy. As long as those measured forces are below a head
injury criterion (HIC) of 1,000, the dummy's head may travel any distance and may impact any object in the test environment
(those objects would be ``soft,'' i.e., padded, for the HIC to be less than 1,000). A head excursion limit is undesirable
because it would restrict travel of the head even when a HIC measurement resulting from excursion over the limit shows
that the excursion would not result in harm. 
Petitioner argued that NHTSA should test built-in restraints without the surrounding features of the vehicle interior
because its restraints can be installed in innumerable vehicles with different interiors. NHTSA believes testing
in the specific vehicle shell is needed because of this variation in the design of vehicle interiors. Built-in restraints
can be installed by the manufacturer anywhere in the vehicle, e.g., the front seat, or middle row of seats in vans, or
rear seat. Seat location can vary significantly, and so too can the features of the vehicle interior surrounding a
built-in restraint, including features such as roof pillars, consoles or other hard structures. To assure that a
restrained child does not hit structures in the vehicle interior, NHTSA must test the built-in restraint with the
surroundings of the vehicle interior that a child can impact in a crash. 
However, the built-in restraint manufacturer has control over which vehicle interiors will surround its restraints.
Standard 213 requires built-in restraint manufacturers to specify in installation instructions accompanying
the restraints which types of vehicles and seating positions the restraint can or cannot be installed. (S5.6.3, adopted
by the April 1993 final rule.) By limiting the vehicle models and seating locations in which the restraint is to be installed,
the manufacturer can manage its certification responsibilities. The manufacturer would be responsible for the
compliance of its restraints with respect to the specified vehicles and positions.

The NPRM preceding the April 1993 final rule explained the significance of a built-in restraint manufacturer's specifying
the vehicle models and seating positions that are suitable for its restraints. Such specification has important
implications and advantages for manufacturers of built-in restraints that do not also manufacture the vehicle in
which the restraint is installed. The NPRM stated: 




The instructions would establish the assumptions that the [built-in restraint] manufacturer had about the vehicle
interior that form the basis for the [restraint's] certification. The instructions specify attributes about the
vehicle interior that are compatible or incompatible with the restraint. For example, the instructions could state
that the restraint must not be installed within a specified distance from any rigid interior structures. The instructions
would help ensure that a built-in restraint performs as intended in the real world. 

NHTSA also believes that the installation instructions would help facilitate compliance testing. If the instructions
were specific as to the vehicle types suitable for the restraint, the agency could determine the configuration of
the ``specific vehicle shell or the specific vehicle'' (S6.1.1.1(a)) for testing the restraint. The agency would
install the restraint pursuant to the manufacturer's instructions. The restraint's performance in the test would
be representative of its performance in the vehicle. 
57 FR 870, 872 (January 9, 1992). 




In other words, built-in restraint manufacturers are responsible for the compliance of their systems in vehicles
and seating positions in which they anticipate that their restraints will be installed. They can control where the
restraints are installed by specifying limits in the installation instructions accompanying the restraint. (These
instructions are typically provided to professionals, not the public, because installing a built-in restraint
into the vehicle as a permanent structure requires more technical ability than that of the average consumer.) The
built-in restraint manufacturer can avoid a noncompliance resulting from use of its restraint in a particular vehicle
or seating position by identifying those vehicles and seating positions that are appropriate for its restraint.


Hassel Free said it was economically unfeasible to test its restraint with each van interior to assess the ability
of the restraint to comply with Standard 213. Testing the restraint with the interior of each van, regardless of limitations
in the manufacturer's instructions, is not required by NHTSA. Further, it is not even necessary to test the restraint
in each model of van which the manufacturer specifies as being suitable for the restraint. 

A manufacturer that tests its restraint for certification purposes could limit its testing by deciding to test only
a ``worst case'' scenario, i.e., testing under the most austere or unfavorable conditions and circumstances specified
in the standard. Relying on worst case testing as a basis for a manufacturer's certification is commonplace among
manufacturers. For example, Standard 208, ``Occupant Crash Protection,'' requires injury criteria to be met with
the test vehicle traveling forward at any speed ``up to and including 30 mph'' into a fixed barrier ``that is perpendicular
to the line of travel of the vehicle, or at any angle up to 30 degrees in either direction from the perpendicular'' (S5.1).
Manufacturers typically test a vehicle at 30 mph into a perpendicular barrier since that is the worst case test. The
manufacturers believe that if the vehicle passes that worst case test, it is reasonable to conclude it will pass less
severe tests (e.g., at lower speeds into angled barriers). Some elements that should be considered in selecting a
worst case test for a built-in restraint manufacturer would be the interior dimensions of the vehicle into which the
built-in seat is installed, the characteristics of the vehicle seat into which the seat is fabricated, the attachment
of the vehicle seat to the vehicle, the integrity of the restraint's belt system, and the proximity of structures that
could be impacted by the dummy's head in a crash. Incorporating these elements into the test assembly is not cost significant.
Hassel Free could test its restraint on the modified test assembly only for the worst case scenario and without undue
economic burden. 

Hassel Free argued that van converters will not want to install the petitioner's built-in child restraint in a vehicle
when they are faced with the responsibility to certify the vehicle to Standard 213. NHTSA believes that any decision
not to install a built-in child seat will stem from reasons other than the certification responsibility. NHTSA's
certification regulations (49 CFR part 567) require van converters to ensure that the alteration they make to a previously-certified
vehicle, or the work done to finish an unfinished vehicle, is in conformance with all applicable FMVSS's. Any device
covered by an FMVSS that is installed on a new vehicle must be certified as complying with that standard. A van converter
that installs any seat (with or without a built-in child seat) in the van, or any item of glazing, or any lighting equipment
or brake hose or safety belt, must certify the compliance, and thus the safety of, that item and installation. 

Van converters can certify the compliance of a built-in seat without conducting a vehicle or shell test. The compliance
test procedures described in the FMVSS's prescribe the procedures that the agency must use to test a vehicle or item
of equipment for compliance with the standard. Manufacturers are not required to use those procedures. In the case
of Standard 213, they may certify the compliance of their vehicles or child restraints to Standard 213 using any information
they choose.

2

 Hassel Free's vehicle converter has the option of deciding it is reasonable to depend on the assurances of Hassel Free
that the built-in child seat will meet Standard 213 (e.g., based on worst case testing) in making its certification.
In addition to Hassel Free's worst case testing, the vehicle converter has the option of satisfying its certification
responsibilities by conducting a vehicle or shell test, or performing engineering analyses such as computer simulations
of the item's performance in a particular vehicle. 





In deciding whether and the degree to which to test, the vehicle converter determines the validity and merits of the
supplier's assurances. This process of weighing the validity of the supplier's assurances is the same whether it
is a built-in child seat that the converter is installing, or any other supplied item of equipment (e.g., vehicle seat,
safety belt, glazing or lighting equipment). Petitioner's claims that van converters will not install built-in
child restraints in their vehicles because of the requirement to certify to Standard 213's dynamic requirements
are unpersuasive. 




For the reasons provided above, the agency is denying Hassel Free's petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



This Defense Acquisition Circular (DAC) 91-6 includes 48 rules and miscellaneous editorial amendments. Twelve
of the rules in the DAC (Items IX, XVIII, XXVII, XXX, XL, and XLIII-XLXIX) were published previously in the 

Federal Register

 and thus are not included as part of this rulemaking notice. These 12 rules are being published in the DAC to revise the
looseleaf edition of DFARS to conform to the previously published revisions.



B. Determination to Issue An Interim Rule 



A determination has been made under authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue the rule in Item XXXVIII as an interim
rule. Compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule without prior opportunity for public comment. However, comments
received in response to publication of this rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act



DAC 91-6, Items I, V, VI, VIII, X, XIII, XVI, XIX, XXII, XXV, XXXI, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV, XXXVI, XXXVII, XXXIX,
XLI, XLII, L



The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply because these rules are not significant revisions within the meaning
of Public Law 98-577. However, comments from small entities will be considered in accordance with section 610
of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately. Please cite DFARS Case 94-610 in correspondence.



DAC 91-6, Items II, III, IV, VII, XI, XII, XIV, XV, XVII, XX, XXI, XXIII, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, XXXII



DoD certifies that these rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because:

Item II_The rule merely standardizes debarment procedures. Contractors who avail themselves of the opportunity
to present matters in opposition to debarment proceedings need not engage legal representation or present written
material.
Item III_The rule only applies to those convicted of fraudulently affixing ``Made in America'' labels.
Item IV_Any additional expenses to contractors as a result of this rule will be reimbursable.
Item VII_The rule merely clarifies existing guidance.
Item XI_The rule is based on a statutory provision which expressly directs these procedural revisions.
Item XII_The rule provides additional guidance on evaluating the contractor's use of small and small disadvantaged
businesses as subcontractors.
Item XIV_The rule extends a test program directed by statute.
Item XV_The rule does not diminish any preferences accorded small businesses, but instead increases incentives
for mentor firms to provide assistance to small businesses.
Item XVII_The rule merely prohibits storage or disposal of hazardous material on Government property.
Item XX_The rule prohibits acquisition of hand or measuring tools of foreign manufacture.
Item XXI_The rule prohibits acquisition of dolly jacks of foreign manufacture.
Item XXIII_The rule prohibits acquisition of antifriction bearings of foreign manufacture.
Item XXVI_Most contracts awarded small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply.
Item XXVIII_Most contracts awarded small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply.
Item XXIX_Most contracts awarded small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply.
Item XXXII_The rule is based directly on a statutory provision which expressly establishes criteria for certification.


DAC 91-6, Item XXXVIII


The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, applies but the magnitude of the expected impact on small entities as a result of the rule is unknown and impossible
to estimate. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was performed and a copy submitted to the Chief Counsel
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for the initially published interim DFARS rule. An amended IRFA
will be submitted to reflect the latest changes in guidance as a result of the statutorily-imposed changes.


D. Paperwork Reduction Act


DAC 91-6, Items I, VIII, X-XIV, XVI, XVII, XIX-XXIII, XXV, XXVI, XXVIII, XXIX, XXXI-XXXV,
XXXVII, XXXIX, XLI, XLII, L


The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the revisions in this rulemaking notice do not contain and/or affect
information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.


DAC 91-6, Item XV


The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. OMB approved the paperwork collection requirement in section 219.71, Pilot
Mentor-Protege Program, under clearance number 0704-0332, through January 31, 1995. OMB also approved the
paperwork collection requirement in appendix I, Policy and Procedures for the DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program,
under clearance number 0704-0338, through February 28, 1995.


DAC 91-6, Item XXXVI


The Paperwork Reduction Act applies. OMB has approved the information collection request for Item XXXVI under clearance
0704-0246, through December 13, 1996.

Defense Acquisition Circular (DAC) 91-6 amends the Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 1991 edition, prescribes
procedures to be followed, and provides informational interest items. The amendments, procedures, and information
are summarized as follows:


Item I_Distribution of Contracts


This final rule amends DFARS section 204.201 to ensure that contract distribution is consistent with security regulations.


Item II_Uniform Suspension and Debarment Procedures


DFARS section 209.402 and appendix H are added to provide uniform suspension and debarment procedures that are to
be followed by all DoD debarring and suspending officials.


Item III_Made in America Labels


This item revises and converts the interim rule published as Item VIII of DAC 91-5 to a final rule. The interim
rule added DFARS sections 209.406-2 and 209.406-4 to require debarment consideration for anyone convicted
of fraudulently affixing ``Made in America'' labels and to specify the period of debarment. This final rule deletes
section 209.406-4, which specified the period of debarment because the statutory mandate to specify the period
of debarment was not continued in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act.


Item IV_Elimination of Ozone-Depleting Substances. 


This finalizes the interim rule issued by Departmental Letter 93-005 on May 21, 1993. The interim rule added
DFARS sections 207.105(b)(15) and 210.002-71 to implement section 326 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization
Act. Section 326 places restrictions on the award and modification of contracts that require the use of ozone-depleting
substances. The interim rule is converted to a final rule without change.


Item V_Bills of Materials


DFARS sections 210.001 and 210.011-70 are revised, and sections 210.070 and 252.210-7005 are deleted
to remove unnecessary direction on contracting for bills of materials. In addition, DD Forms 346 and 347 are removed
from part 253. Guidance on bills of materials can be found in DoDI section 4210.8, Department of Defense Bills of Materials,
and MIL-STD-295, Preparation of Bills of Materials.


Item VI_SBIR Rights in Data


Alternate II of the clause at section 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software, is revised
at paragraphs (b) and (c) to clarify the allocation of rights in technical data and computer software acquired under
the Small Business Innovation Research Program.


Item VII_Adequate Price Competition


DFARS section 215.804-3 is revised to clarify guidance on adequate price competition in dual source acquisitions.

Item VIII_Documentation of Prenegotiation Objectives


DFARS section 215.807(b) is added to emphasize the requirement for documentation of the disposition of audit findings
and recommendations in prenegotiation objectives.


Item IX_Industrial Modernization Incentives Program (IMIP)


DFARS section 215.870 and the clause at section 252.215-7003 were deleted effective January 14, 1993, by Departmental
Letter 93-001, to reflect cancellation of the DoD industrial modernization incentive program. The program
was cancelled September 18, 1992 by the Deputy Secretary of Defense.


Item X_Extension of Set-Aside Authority


DFARS sections 219.000, 226.7000, and the clause at 252.219-7003 are revised to implement section 801 of the
Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. Section 801 of Public Law 102-484 codified and extended authorities
provided under section 1207 of Public Law 99-661 through Fiscal Year 2000. A new paragraph (c) is added to section
219.502-2-70 to implement section 801(g) by establishing a process for determining whether use of small
disadvantaged business (SDB) set-asides has caused a particular industry to bear a disproportionate share of contracts
awarded by a particular contracting activity to achieve its SDB goal.


Item XI_Certificate of Competency


This converts the interim rule, published as Item X of DAC 91-5 to a final rule with no revision. The interim rule
implemented section 804 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. DFARS section 219.602-1 was amended
and a provision at section 252.219-7009 was added to require contracting officers to notify a small business
concern, in writing, of a determination of nonresponsibility and of the concern's right to request the Small Business
Administration to make a determination of the concern's responsibility.


Item XII_Small Business Subcontracting Plan


This revises and finalizes the interim rule published as Item XIII of DAC 91-5. DFARS sections 215.605 and 236.602-1
are revised to elaborate on the requirement to evaluate the extent of participation of small and small disadvantaged
businesses in performance of a contract. DFARS section 219.705-2(d) is revised to cross reference section
215.605.


Item XIII_Surety Bond Waiver Reporting


DFARS section 219.808-1(b)(iv) is added to require contracting officers to prepare quarterly reports on contract
awards where Miller Act requirements for performance and payments bonds are waived under 8(a) construction contracts.
Report Control Symbol DD-ACQ(AR)1930 is assigned to this requirement.


Item XIV_Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program


This item converts the interim rule published as Item XV of DAC 91-5 to a final rule with no change. This rule extended
the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program through September 30, 1996. It also revised part 219 to
(1) state A-E services in support of military construction projects or military family housing are exempt from
the program; and (2) address responsibility for reinstatement of small business set-asides.


Item XV-Pilot Mentor-Protege Program


DFARS is amended to incorporate the DoD policy for the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program as a new appendix I. Conforming
changes have been made to subpart 219.71 to correctly reference the new appendix and to delete redundant material.
This implements section 813 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act.


Item XVI_Ammunition and Explosives


DFARS section 223.370-4(b)(1)(ii) and the clause at section 252.223-7002 are revised to clarify policy
regarding safety precautions for ammunition and explosives.


Item XVII_Storage and Disposal of Toxic and Hazardous Materials


The interim rule published as Item XX of DAC 91-5 is converted to a final rule. The interim rule added DFARS subpart
223.71 and the clause at section 252.223-7006 to incorporate the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2692, as amended
by section 2852 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. An editorial correction is made at section 252.223-7006.


Item XVIII_North American Free Trade Agreement


This is an interim DFARS rule that was effective January 1, 1994. The rule was issued December 23, 1993 by Departmental
Letter 93-010. Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 (Pub.
L. 103-182) requires the three parties to the agreement, (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate
``buy national'' restrictions on nondefense-related purchases by the federal governments. The Federal Acquisition
Regulation (FAR) was amended, effective January 1, 1994, but implementation of NAFTA also required revision of the
Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payment
Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda
of understanding or other international agreements.


Item XIX_Angolan Petroleum


DFARS sections 225.702(2), 225.703, 225.704, and 252.225-7011 are deleted to remove the restriction on acquisition
of petroleum products originating in Angola. Pursuant to section 842 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization
Act, Presidential Determination No. 93-32 certified that free, fair, and democratic elections had taken place
in Angola. This action ended the DoD prohibition on purchasing of petroleum products originating in Angola.


Item XX_Restrictions on Hand or Measuring Tools


DFARS sections 225.7002, 252.225-7012, and 252.225-7015 are revised and 225.7003 is eliminated to combine
the restriction on hand or measuring tools with the restriction on food, clothing, fabrics, and specialty metals.
These items are subject to the same restrictions as a result of section 9009 of Public law 101-165 and similar
restrictions in subsequent Defense Appropriations Acts.

Item XXI_Four Ton Dolly Jacks



This revises and converts the interim rule, published as Item XXVII in DAC 91-5, to a final rule. The interim rule
implemented section 9108 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Appropriations Act. DFARS section 225.7018 and the clause
at section 252.225-7033 were added to restrict purchases of four ton dolly jacks to U.S. manufacturers. DFARS
section 225.7018 is revised to limit this restriction to Fiscal Year 1993 funds. This restriction does not appear
in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act.



Item XXII_Coal and Petroleum Pitch Carbon Fiber



DFARS section 225.7020 and the clause at section 252.225-7034 are added to restrict purchases of coal and petroleum
pitch carbon fiber. This implements section 8040A of Public Law 102-172 and section 9040A of Public Law 102-396.



Item XXIII_Antifriction Bearings



This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXVII of DAC 91-5 to a final rule with no revisions. The interim
rule moved the restriction on antifriction bearings from DFARS subpart 225.71 to DFARS subpart 225.70 because it
is now a statutory restriction based on section 832 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. Section 832
restricts acquisition of antifriction bearings through FY 1995.



Item XXIV_Subcontractor Payment Complaints



On September 27, 1993 the Director of Defense Procurement issued to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies,
a memorandum discussing the actions to be taken to address complaints by subcontractors of nonpayment by a DoD prime
contractor. Recent General Accounting Office and DoD Inspector General reviews have caused concern that this matter
is not fully understood in all locations. Copies of the memorandum should be obtained through normal management channels.



Item XXV_Supplemental Cost Principles



DFARS section 231.100-70 is revised to narrow the prescription for use of the clause at section 252.231-7000,
Supplemental Cost Principles. The cost principles in DFARS do not apply to contracts with educational institutions.



Item XXVI_Penalties for Unallowable Costs



This revises and finalizes the interim rule issued as Item XXXIV of DAC 91-5. The interim rule revised DFARS section
231.70 and the clause at sections 252.231-7001, Penalties for Unallowable Costs, to implement section 818
of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 102-484). Changes between the interim and final rule
include:





_Sections 231.7000(a) and 252.231-7001(b)_Insertion of the word ``indirect'' between the words ``unallowable''
and ``costs'' to clarify that the penalties apply to unallowable ``indirect'' and not ``direct'' costs.

_Section 231.7002-1(b)_Added ``administrative'' to the types of penalties which may be imposed.

_Section 231.7002-5(c)(1)_In the parenthetical, inserted the words ``the types of controls required for''
to make the waiver available to contractors which do not formally participate in a DoD sponsored self-governance
program.


_Section 252.231-7001(e)_Inserted the words ``allocated to this contract'' to make it clear that the penalty
is not based on the total amount of unallowable costs in the indirect costs proposal.



Item XXVII_Reduction in Progress Payment Rates



This is an interim rule issued by Departmental Letter 93-009 on November 18, 1993 to implement Section 8155 of
the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103-139). Section 8155 requires the Department of
Defense to reduce the customary progress payment rate for large businesses from 85 percent to 75 percent for solicitations
issued on or after November 11, 1993. This includes awards to large businesses under foreign military sales contracts.
The rule revised language in DFARS section 232.501-1 and the clause at section 252.232-7004. It also revised
Table 32-1 at section 232.502-1-71 to preclude the use of flexible progress payments in contracts
resulting from solicitations issued on or after November 11, 1993.



Item XXVIII_Overseas Severance Costs



This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXXII of DAC 91-5 to a final rule without change. The interim
rule added DFARS section 237.171 to establish the criteria and conditions for agency waiver of the cost limitations
at section 231.205-6 and it added clauses at sections 252.237-7020 and 252.237-7021.



Item XXIX_Legislative Lobbying Costs



This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXXIII of DAC 91-5 to a final rule without change. The interim
rule added DFARS section 231.205-22(a) to make unallowable the costs of preparing any material, report, list,
or analysis on the actual or projected economic or employment impact in a particular State or congressional district
of an acquisition program for which all research, development, testing and evaluation has not been completed.



Item XXX_Incremental Funding of Fixed-Price Contracts



This interim rule was issued by Departmental Letter 93-008, effective August 23, 1993. The rule added a new subpart
at DFARS section 232.7 to establish specific situations where incremental funding of fixed-price contracts would
be appropriate. The clause at section 252.232-7007, Limitation of Government's Obligation, identifies procedures
for incrementally funding the contract and requires the contractor to provide the Government with written notice
when the work will reach the point at which the amount payable by the Government, including any termination costs,
approximates 85 percent of the funds currently allotted to the contract.



Item XXXI_GAO Bid Protest Procedures



This final rule removes the detailed GAO protest procedures at section 233.104 from the DFARS. Comparable language
was added to the FAR as Item XVII of FAC 90-16.



Item XXXII_Certification of Contract Claims



This revises and finalizes the interim rule issued as Item XXXVI of DAC 91-5. The interim rule revised DFARS subpart
233.70 and the clause at section 252.233-7000, Certification of Claims and Requests for Adjustment or Relief,
to implement section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Pub. L. 102-484). Changes
between the interim and final rule include:




_Section 233.7000(a)_Insertion of the words ``or request'' after the word ``claim'' in section 233.7000(a)(1);
insertion of the words ``who is authorized to bind the contractor and'' after the word ``individual'' in section 233.7000(a)(2);
and an editorial at section 233.7000(a)(2)(ii).

_Section 252.233-7000_In the certification language, deletion of the word ``and'' after the words ``knowledge
and belief''; and revising the last portion of the certification to read ``duly authorized to certify the claim on
behalf of the contractor.'' Also, in paragraph (d) of the clause, insertion of the words ``who is authorized to bind
the contractor and'' after the words ``signed by an individual.''



Item XXXIII_Fixed Price Development Contracts



DFARS section 235.006(b)(ii) is revised to clarify the requirement for USD(A&T) approval of the Government's
prenegotiation position before negotiations begin and of the negotiated agreement with the contractor before it
is executed.



Item XXXIV_Basic Agreements



DFARS section 235.015(b) is amended to delete the reference to the Office of Naval Research as the central DoD activity
for negotiating basic agreements. This reflects the fact that DoD no longer requires a single DoD activity to perform
this function.

Item XXXV_Designation of Paying Office 


DFARS section 242.205(1) is revised to allow a department or agency payment office to serve as paying office for a contract
assigned to the Defense Contract Management Command if authorized by defense financial management regulations.
The revision also deletes the Air Force payment office for missile propellants as these contracts are now paid by Defense
Financial and Accounting Service (DFAS). 



Item XXXVI_Reports of Government Property 


DFARS section 245.505-14 is revised to transfer requirements for contractor reporting on Government property
to a new clause at section 252.245-7001, Reports of Government Property. In addition, the DD Form 1662, DoD Property
in the Custody of Contractors, has been revised to delete the certification requirement and to clarify reporting
instructions. 



Item XXXVII_Precious Metals 


DFARS section 245.607-2(b) is revised to reflect the procedure initiated to streamline the process associated
with the recovery of precious metals. The Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service is prepositioning annual
disposition instructions for certain categories of precious metals with DoD contract administration offices.




Item XXXVIII_Notification of Proposed Program Termination or Reduction 



This interim rule replaces the interim rule which was issued as Departmental Letter 93-007 on August 9, 1993.
It incorporates revisions necessitated by section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
1994 (Pub. L. 103-160). 



Item XXXIX_Title to Contractor Acquired Property 


DFARS section 251.106(b) is deleted because the inconsistency in FAR, that section 251.106(b) was designed to correct,
has been remedied. FAR section 51.106(b) was amended by FAC 90-16 to raise the threshold under which title to
contractor acquired property in contracts with educational institutions vests in the contractor. The $1,000 threshold
in FAR section 51.106(b) was increased to $5,000 to be consistent with the $5,000 threshold in Alternate II of the clause
at FAR section 52.245-2 and Alternate I of the clause at FAR section 52.245-5. 



Item XL_Carbonyl Iron Powders 


DFARS sections 225.7014 through 225.7014-3 and the clause at section 252.225-7023 were removed by departmental
letter 94-001, effective February 14, 1994, to delete the restriction on acquisition of carbonyl iron powders.
Language restricting acquisition to powders manufactured in the United States or Canada was in the FY 93 Defense Appropriations
Act but was not in the FY 94 Defense Appropriations Act. 



Item XLI_Coordinated Acquisition Assignments 



DFARS appendix B is amended to show that the Defense Logistics Agency has only a partial assignment for certain classes
of items within Federal Supply Group 36. 



Item XLII_Appendix G Update 


DFARS Appendix G is amended to update activity address codes. 



Item XLIII_Reflagging or Repair Work 


DFARS sections 247.571 and 247.573 were revised and section 252.247-7025 was added as an interim rule by departmental
letter 94-002, effective February 25, 1994, to implement section 315 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization
Act (Pub. L. 103-160). Section 315 places restrictions on performance of reflagging or repair work on any vessel
used under a time charter contract. 



Item XLIV_Aircraft Fuel Cells 


DFARS sections 225.7021, 225.7021-1, 225.7021-2, 225.7021-3, and 252.225-7038 were added
as an interim rule by departmental letter 94-003, effective March 7, 1994, to implement section 8090 of the Fiscal
Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103-139). Section 8090 prohibits using fiscal year 1994 appropriated
funds to procure aircraft fuel cells unless such cells are produced or manufactured in the United States by a domestic-operated
entity. The clause in section 252.225-7038 is to be included in all solicitations and contracts involving fiscal
year 1994 funds, unless a waiver has been granted in accordance with section 225.7021.2.

Item XLV_Preference for Local and Small Business



DFARS section 219.504 was revised and subpart 226.71 was added as an interim rule by departmental letter 94-004,
effective March 8, 1994, to implement section 2912 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103-160).
Section 2912 requires DoD, when entering into contracts as part of the closure or realignment of a military installation
under a base closure law, to give preference, to the greatest extent practicable, to qualified businesses located
in the vicinity of the installation and to small business and small disadvantaged business concerns. This includes
contracts awarded to carry out activities for the environmental restoration and mitigation at military installations
to be closed or realigned. The guidance in subpart 226.71 is to be used when entering into contracts as part of the closure
or realignment of a military installation. If there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be received from
responsible business concerns located in the vicinity of the military installation that is being closed or realigned,
do not set aside the acquisition for small or small disadvantaged businesses unless an offer can be expected from a
small or small disadvantage business located in the vicinity of the installation.



Item XLVI_Lifeboat Survival Systems



DFARS Sections 225.7022, 225.7022-1, 225.70222-2, and 252,225-7039 were added as an interim rule
by departmental letter 94-005, effective April 13, 1994, to implement section 8124 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense
Appropriations Act, Public Law 103-139. Section 8124 prohibits the purchase of totally enclosed lifeboat
survival systems, which consist of the lifeboat and associated davits and winches, if less than 50 percent of the entire
system's components are manufactured in the United States, and if less than 50 percent of the labor in the manufacture
and assembly of the entire system is performed in the United States.



Item XLVII_Small Disadvantaged Business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority Institutions



DFARS sections 219.301, 226,7005, 252,219-7000, 252,219-7003, 252.219-7006, 252.226-7000,
and 252.226-7001 were revised by departmental letter 94-006, effective April 21, 1994, to implement
subsections 811(a), (b), and (c) of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 103-160). Subsections
811 (a) and (b) revise the definitions for historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority institutions
(MI). Subsection 811(c) deletes the requirement for an offeror, that represents itself on a DoD solicitation as small
disadvantaged business, HBCU, or MI, to maintain its status as such at the time of award. Under this interim rule, the
offeror must qualify as an ADB, HBCU, or MI only at time of submission of the offer.



Item XLVIII_Economy Act



By memorandum of February 8, 1994, the Secretary of Defense established requirements for approval of a written determination
before an Economy Act order may be released outside of DoD for contracting action. DFARS subpart 217.5 was revised
by departmental letter 94-007, effective April 25, 1994, to define the role of the contracting officer in the
approval process for Economy Act orders. Contracting officers should provide advice, if requested, to assist requirements
personnel in the preparation of written determinations to support Economy Act orders.



Item XLXIX_Petroleum Products



DFARS sections 225.401, 225,403, and 225.403-70 were revised by departmental letter 94-008, effective
April 26, 1994, to implement section 8094 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103-139).
Section 8094 requires the Department of Defense to treat offers of petroleum products from eligible countries under
the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act the same as offers from designated countries under the Trade Agreements
Act.

Under the Trade Agreements Act, designated country end products and Caribbean Basin country end products are evaluated
without regard to the Buy American Act or Balance of Payments Program. However, petroleum products were previously
excluded from the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products. The revisions of DFARS sections 225.401, 225.403,
and 225.403-70 remove the exclusion of petroleum products from the definition of ``Caribbean Basin country
end product.'' This will result in treating offers of petroleum from Caribbean Basin countries as if they were offers
from designated countries under the Trade Agreements Act.

Subpart 219.71_Pilot Mentor-Protege Program



 219.7100

Scope.



This subpart implements the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program established under section 831 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, Public Law 101-510, as amended. The purpose of the Program is to provide
incentives for DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged businesses in enhancing their capabilities and to
increase participation of such firms in Government and commercial contracts. Qualified organizations employing
the severely disabled, as defined in section 8064A of Public Law 102-172, are also eligible to participate as
protege firms.



 219.7101 

Policy.



DoD policy and procedures for implementation of the Program are contained in Appendix I to chapter 2, Policy and Procedures
for the DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program.



 219.7102 

General.



The Program includes_

(a) Mentor firms, which are prime contractors with at least one active subcontracting plan negotiated under FAR subpart
19.7.

(b) Protege firms, which are small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns or qualified organizations employing
the severely disabled, eligible for receipt of Federal contracts and selected by the mentor firm.

(c) Mentor-protege agreements, which establish a developmental assistance program for a protege firm.

(d) Incentives, which may be provided to mentor firms by the DoD including:

(1) Reimbursement for developmental assistance costs through_

(i) A separate contract;

(ii) A separately priced contract line item on a DoD contract; or 

(iii) Inclusion of program cost in indirect expense pools.

(2) Credit toward SDB subcontracting goals, established under a subcontracting plan negotiated under FAR subpart
19.7, for developmental assistance costs which are either reimbursed through indirect expense pools or are not reimbursed;
or

(3) A combination of reimbursement and credit.



 219.7103

Procedures.



 219.7103-1

General.



The procedures for application, acceptance, and participation in the program are in appendix I to chapter 2, Policy
and Procedures for the DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program. The Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization,
Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) approves contractors as mentor firms, approves
mentor-protege agreements, and forwards approved mentor-protege agreements to the contracting officer when program
funding is available through a DoD Program Manager.



 219.7103-2 

Contracting officer responsibilities.



Contracting officers shall_

(a) Negotiate an advance agreement on the treatment of developmental assistance costs for credit, reimbursement,
or both, if the mentor firm proposes such an agreement, or delegate authority to negotiate to the administrative contracting
officer (see FAR section 31.109).

(b) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to incorporate the clause at section 2523.232-7005,
Reimbursement of Subcontractor Advance Payments-DoD Pilot Mentor-Protege Program, when advance payments are
provided by a mentor firm to a protege firm under the Program and the mentor firm requests reimbursement of advance
payments.

(c) Modify (without consideration) applicable contract(s) to incorporate other than customary progress payments
for small disadvantaged businesses in accordance with FAR section 32.504(c) if such payments are provided by a mentor
firm to a protege firm and the mentor firm requests reimbursement.

(d) Modify applicable contract(s) to establish a contract line item for reimbursement of developmental assistance
costs_

(1) When funds have been made available for that purpose by a DoD program manager; and

(2) The contractor has an approved mentor-protege agreement.

(e) Advise contractors of reporting requirements in appendix I to chapter 2.



 219.7104

Developmental assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit.



(a) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not
duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's
subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter shall be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's
approved accounting practices. Mentor firm costs which are eligible for reimbursement are set forth in appendix
I to chapter 2.

(b) Before incurring any costs under the Program, mentor firms need to establish the accounting treatment of developmental
assistance costs eligible for reimbursement or credit. Advance agreements are encouraged. To be eligible for reimbursement
under the Program, costs must be incurred before October 1, 1996.

(c) If the mentor firm is suspended or debarred while performing under an approved mentor-protege agreement, the
mentor firm may not be reimbursed or credited for developmental assistance costs incurred more than 30 days after
the imposition of the suspension or debarment.

(d) Developmental assistance costs, incurred by a mentor firm before October 1, 1999, that are eligible for crediting
under the Program may be credited towards subcontracting plan goals as set forth in appendix I to chapter 2.



 219.7105

Reporting.



Mentor firms shall report on the progress made under active mentor-protege agreements semi-annually as indicated
in section I-111 of appendix I to chapter 2.

(a) 

Definitions. 

``Major defense program'' means a program that is carried out to produce or acquire a major system (as defined in 10
U.S.C. 2302) (see also DoD Instruction 5000.2, Defense Acquisition Management Policies and Procedures, Acquisition
Categories I and II). ``Substantial reduction'' means a reduction of 25 percent or more in the total dollar value of
contracts under the program.

(b) Section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 is intended to help establish benefit
eligibility under the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1661 and 1662) for employees of DoD contractors and
subcontractors adversely affected by termination or substantial reductions in major defense programs.

(c) 

Notice to employees and state and local officials.

 Within two weeks after the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor that a major defense program is proposed for,
or likely to be, terminated or substantially reduced, the contractor shall provide notice of such proposed or anticipated
termination or reduction to_

(1) Each employee representative of the Contractor's employees whose work is directly related to the program; or

(2) If there is no such representative, each such employee; 

(3) The State dislocated worker unit or office described in section 311(b)(2) of the Job Training Partnership Act
(29 U.S.C. 1661(b)(2)); and

(4) The chief elected official of the unit of general local government within which the adverse effect may occur.

(d) 

Notice to subcontractors.

 As soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer's notice
of the proposed termination or reduction in a major defense program, the Contractor shall_

(1) Provide notice of the proposed termination or reduction to each first-tier subcontractor with a subcontract
of $500,000 or more under the program; and

(2) Require that each such subcontractor_

(i) Provide notice to each of its subcontractor with a subcontract of $100,000 or more under the program; and

(ii) Impose a similar notice and flowdown requirement to subcontractors with subcontracts of $100,000 or more.

(e) The notice provided an employee under paragraph (c) of this clause shall have the same effect as a notice of termination
to the employee for the purposes of determining whether such employee is eligible for training, adjustment assistance,
and employment services under section 325 or 325A of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1662d, 1662d-1).
If the Contractor has specified that the proposed program termination or reduction is not likely to result in plant
closure or mass layoff, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 2101, the employee shall be eligible only for services under section
314(b) and paragraphs (1) through (14), (16), and (18) of section 314(c) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C.
1661c(b) and paragraphs (1) through (14), (16), and (18) of section 1661c(c)).

(f) If the Contracting Officer subsequently withdraws a notice referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this clause,
the Contractor, as soon as practicable but not later than two weeks after receipt of the withdrawal notice, shall provide
notice of the withdrawal to_

(1) The representatives, employees, officers, officials, and subcontractors specified in paragraphs (c) and (d)
of this clause; and

(2) Each grantee under section 325(a) or 325A(a) of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1662d, 1662d-1),
which provides training, adjustment assistance, and employment services to the employees.

(g) An employee who receives notice of withdrawal shall not be eligible for training, adjustment assistance, or employment
services under section 325 or 325A of the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1662d, 1662d-1), beginning
on the date the employee receives such notice.

Appendix H to Chapter 2



117. A new DFARS Appendix H_Debarment and Suspension Procedures is added to Chapter 2 to read as follows:



Appendix H_Debarment and Suspension Procedures



Sec.



H-100 Scope.
H-101 Notification.
H-102 Nature of proceeding.
H-103 Presentation of matters in opposition.
H-104 Fact-finding.
H-105 Timing requirements.
H-106 Subsequent to fact-finding.






Authority:

 41 U.S.C. 421 and FAR subpart 1.3.



H-100 

Scope.



This appendix provides uniform debarment and suspension procedures to be followed by all debarring and suspending
officials.



H-101 

Notification.



Contractors will be notified of the proposed debarment or suspension in accordance with FAR 9.406-3 or 9.407-3.
A copy of the record which formed the basis for the decision by the debarring and suspending official will be made available
to the contractor. If there is a reason to withhold from the contractor any portion of the record, the contractor will
be informed of what is withheld and the reasons for such withholding.



H-102 

Nature of proceeding.



There are two distinct proceedings which may be involved in the suspension or debarment process. The first is the presentation
of matters in opposition to the suspension or proposed debarment by the contractor.

The second is fact-finding which occurs only in cases in which the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition
raises a genuine dispute over one or more material facts. In a suspension action based upon an indictment or in a proposed
debarment action based upon a conviction or civil judgment, there will be no fact-filling proceeding concerning
the matters alleged in the indictment, or the facts underlying the convictions or civil judgment. However, to the
extent that the proposed action stems from the contractor's affiliation with an individual or firm indicted or convicted,
or the subject of a civil judgment, fact-finding is permitted if a genuine dispute of fact is raised as to the question
of affiliation as defined in FAR 9.403.



H-103 

Presentation of matters in opposition.



(a) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), matters in opposition may be presented in person,
in writing, or through a representative. Matters in opposition may be presented through any combination of the foregoing
methods, but if a contractor desires to present matters in person or through a representative, any written material
should be delivered at least 5 working days in advance of the presentation. Usually, all matters in opposition are
presented in a single proceeding. A contractor who becomes aware of a pending indictment or allegations of wrongdoing
that the contractor believes may lead to suspension or debarment action may contact the debarring and suspending
official or designee to provide information as to the contractor's present responsibility.

(b) An in-person presentation is an informal meeting, nonadversarial in nature. The debarring and suspending official
and/or other agency representatives may ask questions of the contractor or its representative making the presentation.
The contractor may select the individuals who will attend the meeting on the contractor's behalf; individual respondents
or principals of a business firm respondent may attend and speak for themselves.

(c) In accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and 9.407-3(c), the contractor may submit matters in opposition
within 30 days from receipt of the notice of suspension or proposed debarment.

(d) The opportunity to present matters in opposition to debarment includes the opportunity to present matters concerning
the duration of the debarment.



H-104 

Fact-finding.



(a) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether the contractor's presentation has raised a genuine
dispute of material fact(s). If the debarring and suspending official has decided against debarment or continued
suspension, or the provisions of FAR 9.4 preclude fact-finding, no fact-finding will be conducted. If the debarring
and suspending official has determined a genuine dispute of material fact(s) exists, a designated fact-finder will
conduct the fact-finding proceeding. The proceeding before the fact-finder will be limited to a finding of the facts
in dispute as determined by the debarring and suspending official.

(b) The designated fact-finder will establish the date for a fact-finding proceeding, normally to be held within
45 working days of the contractor's presentation of matters in opposition. An official record will be made of the fact-finding
proceeding.

(c) The Government's representative and the contractor will have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to
the facts at issues. The contractor may appear in person or through a representative in the fact-finding proceeding.

(d) Neither the Federal Rules of Evidence nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure govern fact-finding. Hearsay evidence
may be presented and will be given appropriate weight by the fact-finder.

(e) Witnesses may testify in person. Witnesses will be reminded of the official nature of the proceeding and that any
false testimony given is subject to criminal prosecution. Witnesses are subject to cross-examination.



H-105 

Timing requirements.



All timing requirements set forth in these procedures may be extended by the debarring and suspending official for
good cause.



H-106 

Subsequent to fact-finding.



(a) Written findings of fact will be prepared by the fact-finder as mandated by FAR 9.406-3(d)(2)(i) and 9.407-3(d)(2)(i).

(b) The fact-finder will determine the disputed fact(s) by a preponderance of the evidence. A copy of the findings
of fact will be provided to the debarring and suspending official, the Government's representative, and the contractor.

(c) The debarring and suspending official will determine whether to continue the suspension or to debar the contractor
based upon the entire administrative record, including the findings of fact.

(d) Prompt written notice of the debarring and suspending official's decision will be sent to the contractor and any
affiliates involved, in compliance with FAR 9.406-3(e) and 9.407-3(d)(4).

Purpose.


(a) Appendix I to 48 CFR chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Program'')
established under section 831 of Pub. L. 101-510, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991,
as amended. The purpose of the Program is to_
(1) Provide incentives to major DoD contractors, performing under at least one active approved subcontracting plan
negotiated with DoD or other Federal agencies, to assist small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) in enhancing their
capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements;
(2) Increase the overall participation of SDBs as subcontractors and suppliers and DoD contracts, other Federal
agency contracts and commercial contracts and;
(3) Foster the establishment of long term business relationships between SDBs and such contractors.
(b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with
eligible SDBs as protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of SDBs
to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. According to the law, the DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost
reimbursement, credit against SDB subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies,
or a combination of credit and reimbursement.
(c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in_
(1) An increase in the dollar value of subcontracts awarded to SDBs by mentor firms under DoD contracts;
(2) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts
awarded by other Federal agencies and under commercial contracts) since the date of their entry into the Program;
(3) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by
its mentor firm (or former mentor firm);
(4) An improvement in the participation of SDBs in DoD, other Federal agencies, and commercial contracting opportunities
that can be attributed to the development of SDBs as protege firms under the Program;
(5) An increase in subcontracting with SDB concerns in industry categories where SDBs have not traditionally participated
within the mentor firm's vendor base;
(6) The involvement of emerging SDBs in the Program;
(7) An expanded relationship between mentor firms and protege firms to include non-DoD programs; and
(8) The development of protege firms that are competitive as subcontractors and suppliers to DoD or in other Federal
agencies or commercial markets.
(d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested
in receiving_
(1) A separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered into between DoD and the mentor firm_company
is interested in reimbursement through a separate contract, cooperative agreement or other agreement with DoD or,
a combination of reimbursement through such agreement with DoD and credit against SDB subcontract goals for any unreimbursed
costs incurred under the Program.
(2) Program Manager funded reimbursement_company has identified a DoD program manager willing to fund the Program
and the company is interested in reimbursement for technical assistance costs to a protege firm(s) through a separately
priced cost reimbursement contract line item added to a DoD contract, with credit against SDB subcontracting goals
for any unreimbursed costs.
(3) Indirect reimbursement and credit_company is interested in receiving reimbursement for indirect costs incurred
under the Program as well as credit against SDB subcontract goals for these indirect costs.
(4) Credit only_company is interested in receiving credit only against SDB subcontracting goals for costs incurred
under the Program.

plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9.

(b) For crediting purposes only, costs that have been reimbursed via inclusion in indirect expense pools may also
be credited as subcontract awards for determining the performance of such mentor firm in attaining an SDB subcontracting
goal(s) established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to FAR 52.219-9. However,
costs that have not been reimbursed because they are not reasonable, allocable, or allowable under I-108(b),
shall not be recognized for crediting purposes.

(c) Other costs that are not eligible for reimbursement pursuant to I-108(a) may be recognized for credit only
if requested, identified, and incorporated in an approved mentor-protege agreement. Such costs are not eligible
for reimbursement.

(d) The amount of credit a mentor firm may receive for any such unreimbursed developmental assistance costs shall
be equal to_

(1) Four times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance provided by small business development centers
(SBDC), historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), minority institutions (MI), and procurement technical
assistance centers (PTAC).

(2) Three times the total amount of such costs attributable to assistance furnished by the mentor's employees.

(3) Two times the total amount of other such costs incurred by the mentor in carrying out the developmental assistance
program.

(e) A mentor firm may receive credit toward the attainment of an SDB subcontracting goal(s) for each subcontract awarded
for a product or a service by the mentor firm to an entity that qualifies as a protege firm pursuant to I-104(a).
With respect to a former SDB protege (firm(s), a mentor may take credit for awards to such concern(s) that, except for
its size would be a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,
but only if_

(1) The size of such business concern is not more than two times the appropriate size standard;

(2) The business concern formerly had a mentor-protege agreement with such mentor firm that was not terminated for
cause; and

(3) The credit is taken not later than October 1, 1999.

(f) Amounts credited toward the SDB goal(s) for unreimbursed costs under the Program shall be separately identified
from the amounts credited toward the goal resulting from the award of actual subcontracts to protege firms. The combination
of the two shall equal the mentor firm's overall accomplishment toward the SDB goal(s).

(g) Adjustments may be made to the amount of credit claimed under paragraphs I-109(a) and (b) if the DoD Director
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization determines that_

(1) A mentor firm's performance in the attainment of its SDB subcontracting goals through actual subcontract awards
declined from the prior fiscal year without justifiable cause.

(2) Imposition of such a limitation on credit appears to be warranted to prevent abuse of this incentive for mentor
firm's participation in the Program.

(h) The mentor firm shall be afforded the opportunity to explain the decline in SDB participation before imposition
of any such limitation on credit. In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, the DoD Director shall
consider_

(1) The mentor firm's overall SDB participation rates (in terms of percentages of subcontract awards and dollars
awarded) as compared to the participation rates existing during the two fiscal years prior to the firm's admission
to the Program;

(2) The mentor firm's aggregate prime contract awards during the prior two fiscal years and the total amount of subcontract
awards under such contracts; and

(3) Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.

(i) The decision of the Director regarding the imposition of a limitation on credit shall be final.

(j) Any prospective limitation on credit imposed by the Director shall be expressed as a percentage of otherwise eligible
credit and shall apply beginning on a specific date in the future and continue until a date certain during the current
fiscal year.

(k) Any retroactive limitation on credit imposed by the Director shall reflect the actual costs incurred for developmental
assistance (not exceeding the maximum amount reimbursed).

(l) For purposes of calculating any incentives to be paid to a mentor firm for exceeding an SDB subcontracting goal
pursuant to 252.219-7009, incentives shall be paid only if an SDB subcontracting goal has been exceeded as a
result of actual subcontract awards to SDBs (excluding credit under paragraphs I-109 (a), (b) and (c)).

(m) Developmental assistance costs that are incurred pursuant to an approved mentor-protege agreement, and have
been charged to, but not reimbursed through a separate contract, cooperative agreement, or other agreement entered
into between the DoD and the mentor firm, or through a separately priced contract line item added to a DoD contract,
shall not be otherwise reimbursed, either as a direct or indirect cost, under any other DoD contract, irrespective
of whether the costs have been recognized for credit against SDB subcontracting goals.

(n) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and shall not
duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's
subcontract. Costs associated with the latter shall be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's
approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit
or reimbursement under the Program.



I-110 

Advance agreements on the treatment of developmental assistance costs.



Pursuant to FAR 31.109, approved mentor firms seeking reimbursement, credit, or a combination thereof, are strongly
encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect
cost rates under FAR 42.705. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs
of the development assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the
mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent
dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental
assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting
treatment of such costs and address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from
the implementation of a mentor-protege agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs
will be reimbursed, credited or a combination thereof.

SUMMARY: 

The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI)
is amending its regulations governing the information that must be submitted in a permit application concerning
premining and postmining land use. The regulations are being amended for the purpose of eliminating duplicative
and/or unnecessary reporting requirements in order to simplify and reduce the reporting burden for permit applicants.

I. Background



On March 13, 1979, OSM promulgated permanent program rules (44 FR 14902) as required by section 501(b) of the Surface
Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1201 

et seq. 

In these rules, 30 CFR part 779 establishes the minimum permit application requirements for information on existing
environmental resources that may be impacted by the location and conduct of proposed surface mining activities.
(Part 783 for underground mining) (44 FR 15026, March 13, 1979).

Thirty CFR part 780 establishes the minimum permit application requirements for surface mining operation and reclamation
plans. (Part 784 for underground mining) (44 FR 15047, March 13, 1979).

The information requirements of parts, 779, 780, 783, and 784 accord with the prescriptions of sections 507, 508,
515, and 516 of the Act in two ways: First, the permit application submitted pursuant to these parts must contain sufficient
information to meet the public disclosure requirements of the Act. Second, the permit application must also contain
sufficient information for the regulatory authority to be able to find in writing, on the basis of that information
and information otherwise available, whether the proposed operation should be permitted.
The level of detail and scope of information required in the permit application will vary depending on the needs of
the regulatory authority to fulfill its responsibility to make sound approval decisions based on the findings prescribed
under section 510(b) or SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(c). The information required in a permit application is, in the main,
intended to assist the regulatory authority in determining whether the applicant can comply with the performance
standards for surface and underground mining and whether reclamation of these areas is feasible.
The information requirements of parts 779, 780, 783, and 784 impose a significant reporting burden on permit applicants
to obtain, analyze, and present information to both the regulatory authority and the public when seeking to permit
a surface coal mining operation. Under the Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986, OSM is responsible for
ensuring that its rules do not impose any unnecessary reporting burden on the permit applicant (44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(B)).
In 1987, OSM established a work group to review its regulatory program and permitting rules. One purpose of the review
was to determine whether changes to the information requirements of the permitting rules could be made to reduce the
reporting burden on the permit applicant without compromising the implementation of the purposes and provisions
of the Act.
After reviewing the work group's recommendations regarding rule changes, OSM identified two changes to its regulations
governing surface and underground mining activities which are the subject of this rulemaking. While OSM recognizes
its obligation under the Paperwork Reduction Reauthorization Act of 1986 to ensure that public reporting burden
be minimized, the Office also recognizes the need to maintain a stable regulatory program implementing the Act. On
this basis, the balance of the work group's recommended rule changes were rejected because OSM felt the insignificant
reduction in reporting burden which they would afford did not justify the potential disruption to the regulatory
program which would be caused by such changes.
On January 8, 1993 (57 FR 3458), OSM proposed a rulemaking based on two of these recommendations. The public comment
period closed on March 9, 1993. For surface mining activities, this final rulemaking consolidates the land use information
requirements of sections 30 CFR 779.22 and 30 CFR 780.23 into final 30 CFR 780.23 and deletes the slope measurement
requirements of 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11). For the counterpart regulations governing underground mining activities,
this rulemaking consolidates the land use information requirmeents of 30 CFR 783.22 and 30 CFR 784.15 into final 30
CFR 784.15 and deletes the slope measurement requirements of 30 CFR 783.25 (a)(11).
Because the cited regulations governing underground activities are identical to counterpart regulations governing
surface mining activities, the discussion of changes or deletions to 30 CFR 779.22, 779.25(a)(11) and 780.23 will
also apply to 30 CFR 783.22, 783.25(a)(11) and 784.15.


A. Land Use Information Rules


Section 30 CFR 779.22 identified the premining land use information required in a permit application.
Section 779.22(a) required that the application contain a statement of the condition, capability, and productivity
of the land within the proposed permit area. Section 779.22(a)(1) required that the application contain a map and
a narrative that describes the use of the proposed permit area at the time of filing and the premining land use if its
use was changed within five years before the date of application. The map was used to compare premining land uses with
proposed postmining land uses. Section 779.22(a)(1) implemented section 508(a)(2)(A) of the Act.
Section 779.22(a)(2) required that the permit application include a narrative of the capability and productivity
of the land to support a number of uses which can be used in analyzing the land use description contained in section 779.22(a)(1).
Environmental information from  779.22(a)(2) together with land use information from  779.22(a)(1)
provided a foundation for the reclamation plan required by former section 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Postmining
land uses). Section 779.22(a)(2) and its two subsections, (i) and (ii), implemented sections 508 (a)(2) (B) and (C)
of the Act.
Section 779.22(b) required a description of premining land use conditions for previously mined areas. These regulations
provided that an application for a previously mined area identify the type of mining method used, the coal seams or
other mineral strata mined, the extent of coal or minerals removed, the approximate dates of past mining, and the uses
of the land preceding mining. According to the 1979 Preamble, this information, if available, was intended to be used
by the operator and the regulatory authority to assure that the mining operation will be conducted in a manner which
mitigates the environmental damage caused by the previous mining activities (44 FR 15041, March 13, 1979). The 779.22(b)(5)
informational requirements as to the uses of land preceding prior mining implemented sections 508(a)(2)(A) and
515(b)(2) of the Act. The balance of  779.22(b) is not specifically required by the Act.
Section 779.22(c) required that the application describe the proposed mining area's existing land uses and their
classifications under local law. Information from this section was used by the regulatory authority to evaluate
the proposed postmining land uses and to assess the compatibility of the proposed land use with the existing land use
policies and plans. The information required by this section was essentially the same information required by former
 780.23(a)(4) and (b). Section 779.22(c) implemented Section 508(a)(3) of the Act.
Section 30 CFR 780.23 established the criteria used to approve a postmining land use analysis and plan. Section 780.23
implemented Section 508(a) (3) and (4) of the Act.
Section 780.23(a) required that the applicant's reclamation plan describe the proposed postmining land use. Included
must be a discussion of the utility and capacity of the reclaimed land to support a variety of alternative uses which
must conform to the existing land use policies and plans. Section 780.23(a) implemented Section 508(a)(3) of the
Act.

<PARENT> FR940527-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Section 780.23(a)(1) required a description of the proposed postmining land use and the method in which the proposed
postmining land use is attained. Section 780.23(a)(1) implemented section 508(a)(4) of the Act.


Section 780.23(a)(2) required specific management plans when range and grazing is proposed as a postmining land
use. Range or grazing management plans are not specifically required by the Act.


Section 780.23(a)(3) required information needed to support approval for an alternative postmining land use when
requested under  816.133. Section 780.23(a)(3) implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act.


Section 780.23(a)(4) required that consideration be given to making proposed mining activities consistent with
the existing surface owner plans and applicable State and local land use plans and programs. Section 780.23(a)(4)
implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act.


Section 780.23(b) provided that the reclamation plan include a copy of the comments of the proposed land use by the
legal or equitable owner of record of the surface of the proposed permit area and the applicable State and local government
agency. Section 780.23(b) implemented section 508(a)(3) of the Act.



B. Slope Measurement




Section 30 CFR 779.25 (Cross sections, maps, and plans) required slope measurements against which new mining effects
can be compared. Section 779.25(a)(11) required the applicant to include the existing slopes of the proposed mine
site. The 1979 preamble indicates that slope can be derived from either a topographic map or from field calculations
(44 FR 15045, March 13, 1979). These slope measurements were to be used by the regulatory authority to evaluate the
applicant's ability to achieve approximate original contour. There is no specific requirement in the Act to provide
preexisting slope measurements.



II. Discussion of Comments and Final Rule




OSM received letters on the proposed rule from eight commenters representing industry, State regulatory authorities,
Federal and State agencies, and individual citizens. OSM has reviewed each comment carefully and has considered
the commenters' suggestions and remarks in writing this final rule.


The final rulemaking simplifies the current regulations by promulgating a single new rule, 30 CFR 780.23 (Land use
information), to replace the two former land use information rules. Final  780.23 combines sections from former
780.23 (Reclamation plan: Postmining land uses) and former 779.22 (Land use information). This rulemaking deletes
former  779.22 in its entirety. Paragraphs from former  779.22 needed to implement prescriptions of
the Act have been relocated to final 780.23. The final rule also deletes 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11) (Cross sections, maps,
and plans) in its entirety.



A. Land Use Information




Listed below is an outline of the informational requirements that are incorporated into final 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation
plan: Land use information). This rule is identical to proposed 30 CFR 780.23 except as indicated below.


1. Final section 780.23(a) requires that the applicant provide a statement of the condition, capability, and the
productivity of the land within the proposed permit area. Section 780.23(a) is identical to former  779.22(a).
No comments were received addressing the redesignation of this section. Section 780.23(a) implements section 508(a)(2)
of the Act.


2. Final  780.23(a)(1) requires a map and supporting narrative describing the uses of the land at the time of
the filing of the application. The description must also include any changes to the land use which occurred during
the past five years, except in a case where the application is for lands which were previously mined, in which case the
description must include the use of the land prior to any mining to the extent such information is available. Final
section 780.23(a)(1) incorporates the provisions of former  779.22 (a)(1) and (b)(5). Proposed section 780.23(a)(1)
was identical to former  779.22(a)(1) except that it would have deleted the five-year limit on the historical
land use description. As proposed,  780.23(a)(1) would have also subsumed the reporting requirements of  779.22(b)(5).


Several commenters felt that the proposed deletion of the five-year limit on the historical land use description
would have added to the reporting burden on the applicant and that the information collected would often be unnecessary.
One commenter supported the proposed change and believed that there was sufficient enabling language for the regulatory
agency's requirement of a historical land use description. OSM has reconsidered the proposal and agrees with the
concerns of the commenters opposing the deletion of the five-year time frame in that it may add an unnecessary reporting
burden on the applicant.

<TEXT>
 

Section 515(b)(2) of the Act requires that the operation restore the land affected to a condition capable of supporting
the uses which it was capable of supporting prior to any mining and section 508(a)(2)(A) requires the reclamation
plan to include a statement on the condition of the land to be covered by the permit prior to any mining, including the
uses existing at the time of the application and, if the land has a history of previous mining, the uses which preceded
any mining. Accordingly, final  780.23(a)(1) will retain the five-year limit on the historical land use description
of former  779.22(a)(1) and will include for previously mined areas the land use reporting provisions of former
 779.22(b)(5) which are required to implement sections 508(a)(2)(A) and 515(b)(2) of the Act.

3. Final  780.23(a)(2) requires that the applicant provide a narrative of the land capability and productivity,
which analyzes the land use description in conjunction with other environmental resource information. Final  780.23(a)(2)
is identical to former  779.22(a)(2). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(a)(2)(i)
implements section 508(a)(2)(B) of the Act and  780.23(a)(2)(ii) implements section 508(a)(2)(C) of the
Act.

4. Final section 780.23(b) requires that the applicant provide a statement on the utility and capacity of the reclaimed
land to support a variety of alternative uses. Final  780.23(b) is identical to former  780.23(a). No
comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(b) implements section 508(a)(3) of the Act.

5. Final  780.23(b)(1) requires that the applicant discuss how the proposed postmining land use will be achieved.
Final  780.23(b)(1) is identical to former  780.23(a)(1). No comments were received addressing this
redesignation. Section 780.23(b)(1) implements sections 508(a)(4) of the Act.

6. Final  780.23(b)(2) requires that the applicant include a detailed description of proposed postmining
land uses that are different from the premining land uses. Final  780.23(b)(2) is identical to former section
780.23(a)(3). No comments were received addressing this redesignation. Section 780.23(b)(2) implements sections
508(a)(2)(A) and 508(a)(3) of the Act.

7. Final  780.23(b)(3) requires that the applicant describe the consideration which has been given to making
all of the proposed surface mining activities consistent with surface owner plans and applicable State and local
land use plans and programs. These provisions are identical to those of former  780.23(a)(4) and the first sentence
of proposed  780.23(c) and have been redesignated as  780.23(b)(3) to enhance the organizational clarity
of the final rule. Section 780.23(b)(3) implements section 508(a)(8) of the Act.

8. Final  780.23(c) requires that the applicant describe comments by the legal or equitable owner of record
of the surface of the proposed permit area and the State and local government agencies which would have to initiate,
implement, approve, or authorize the proposed use of the land following reclamation. Final  780.23(c) is identical
to former  780.23(b). Section 780.23(c) implements section 508(a)(3) of the Act.

One comment was received alleging the impracticality of such a requirement and the lack of flexibility which it affords
the operator in obtaining comments. However, OSM is retaining this requirement as it implements specific statutory
prescriptions.



B. Deletion of Land Use Information Requirements



Listed below is an outline of the informational requirements that were deleted from former rules during the formulation
of final 30 CFR 780.23 (Reclamation plan: Land use information). This rule is identical to proposed 30 CFR 780.23 except
as indicated below.

1. This rulemaking deletes section 30 CFR 779.22(b). This section required that if specific information about mining
activities at previously mined areas is available, such information must be included in the permit application.
As will be discussed below, if the information required under this section is even available, it is either provided
elsewhere by the applicant in his permit application or is available from former program permitting records and is,
therefore, more accessible to the regulatory authority than to the applicant.

Two commenters agreed with OSM's proposed deletion of  779.22(b) in its entirety. They felt that much of the
information required under this provision will already be contained in the application through other applicable
provisions. 
 
a. Former  779.22(b)(1) required a description of the type of mining method used at any previously mined area.
To the extent that the applicant is able to submit the required cross sections, maps, and plans of prior mining operations
within and adjacent to the permit area under existing 30 CFR 779.25(a) (5) and (8), the regulatory authority can determine
from this information the type of mining methods which were used. OSM agrees with the one comment received regarding
the deletion of 779.22(b)(1) that the information provided by this section has historically been of minimal benefit.

 
b. Former   779.22(b) (2) and (3) required a description of the coal seams or other mineral strata mined
and the extent of coal or other minerals removed from the previously mined area. This information can easily be calculated
by the regulatory authority from other information required to be submitted by the applicant under 30 CFR 779.25(a)
(3), (4), (8), and 30 CFR 780.11(a). OSM agrees with the one comment received regarding the deletion of 779.22(b) (2)
and (3) that the information provided by these sections has historically been of minimal benefit. 
 
c. Former  779.22(b)(4) required a statement of the approximate dates of previous mining activities. In its
1979 rules, OSM did not require the precise dates of these activities because of the acknowledged difficulty of obtaining
such information with any degree of accuracy (44 FR 15041, March 13, 1979). In practice, information as to the approximate
dates of previous mining activities has proven to be generally unnecessary. The only time that the approximate dates
of previous mining activities might be necessary is when the applicant intends to reclaim in accordance with the requirements
of 30 CFR 816.106. Under those circumstances, the applicant is required by the authority, that of 30 CFR 773.15(c)
and (c)(12), to affirmatively include in the permit application information as to the cessation dates of previous
activities. The regulatory authority must then find in writing that the site of the proposed operation is a ``previously
mined area'' as defined in 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the continuance of  779.22(b) serves no useful regulatory
purpose. 
 
One commenter opposed this deletion claiming that the information of 779.22(b)(4) is necessary when judging the
success at 30 CFR 816.116(5). As this section is nonexistent, the apparent intended reference is 30 CFR 816.116(b)(5).
OSM rejects this comment as there is no clear relationship between the approximate date of premining operations required
under 779.22(b)(4) and establishment of the baseline level of vegetative cover before redisturbance required by
816.115(b)(5). As it is, there is more than sufficient information required under the other permit application provisions
of 30 CFR parts 779 and 780 for the regulatory authority to fulfill its responsibilities under  816.116(b)(5).

 
d. Former  779.22(b)(5) required a statement of the premining land use for lands previously affected by mining
to the extent such information is available. Final  780.23(a)(1) will include this requirement among its provisions.
One commenter supported the proposed deletion of 779.22(b)(5) on the basis that the scope of information required
by that section served little useful purpose. Another commenter contended that because the same historical land
use information required by 779.22(b)(5) would also be required by proposed 780.23(a)(1), the stated purpose of
the rulemaking of eliminating or reducing paperwork would not really be accomplished. In partial response to this
comment and as discussed above, OSM decided not to finalize the expanded reporting requirement of proposed 780.23(a)(1)
but instead retain that section's existing, less burdensome requirements. This necessitated the inclusion of former
 779.22(b)(5) in final  780.23(a)(1) in order to ensure that   515(b)(2) and 508(a)(2)(A)
of the Act are implemented and that the land use of previously mined land is described. This description helps to ensure
the restoration of the land affected by mining will be to the same or higher or better land use than existed prior to any
mining as required by the Act. The permit applicant's historical land use reporting burden continues to be reduced
as the consolidation of requirements into final  780.23(a)(1) eliminates duplicative reporting requirements.

 
2. This rulemaking deletes 30 CFR 779.22(c) which required a description of the existing land uses and land use classifications
under local law of the proposed permit area and adjacent areas. While OSM considers the information required by this
provision to be important land use information, it is essentially the same information required by former   780.23
(a)(4) and (b) redesignated in the final rule as   780.23 (b)(3) and (c). These redesignated sections
provide that the application indicate the consideration given to making the surface mining activities consistent
with applicable State and local land use plans and programs as well as comments on the proposed use by applicable State
and local agencies.

One commenter opposed this deletion alleging that proposed 780.23(c) does not specifically require the same information
as was provided to the regulatory authority by former 779.22(c) deleted in this rulemaking. The commenter characterized
 779.22(c) as serving to eliminate any doubt as to the regulatory agency's authority for requiring a description
and classification of the land uses under local law. In deleting former  779.22(c), OSM does not intend to infer
that final 780.23(c) does not continue to convey sufficient general authority for the regulatory authority to require
all the information previously and specifically required by the deleted section.
3. This rulemaking also deletes former 30 CFR 780.23(a)(2) which required the submission of a detailed management
plan where range or grazing was the proposed postmining land use. In 1979, OSM rejected comments to delete this section.
At that time, OSM stated its belief that a detailed management plan was necessary to determine the feasibility of a
proposed range/grazing postmining land use. (44 FR 15058, March 13, 1979). Since then, OSM has reconsidered the utility
of requiring such detailed plans. In concert with this rulemaking, OSM consulted the Bureau of Land Management regarding
its current views on the need for a detailed management plan to be included in the permit application for a surface coal
mining and reclamation operation. The Bureau indicated that the proposed deletion of the requirement for submitting
such plans would not affect its program which also required detailed management plans. OSM understands that for legitimate
economic and/or ecological reasons the actual management plan implemented for a reclaimed area may often vary greatly
from the detailed plan originally submitted under  780.23(a)(2). The uncertain benefit which may be derived
from the submission of these plans is not felt to justify the burden of their preparation.
One commenter supported the deletion of  780.23(a)(2) stating that a detailed management plan was unnecessary.
Two other commenters disagreed with the deletion but suggested a change in the regulatory language of  780.23(a)(2)
to require a ``general'' instead of a ``detailed'' management plan. OSM does not accept that suggestion. Former  780.23(a)(1)
which required an explanation of how the postmining land use is to be achieved has been redesignated as final section
780.23(b)(1) and should allow for the level of reporting detail necessary for the regulatory authority to determine
the feasibility of any proposed range land/grazing land use.


B. Vegetation Information


The Proposed Rules discussed the deletion of 30 CFR 779.19 (Vegetation information). This section authorizes a regulatory
authority to require a map and a description of the plant communities within the proposed permit area and within any
proposed reference area. OSM originally envisioned that this detailed information could be helpful in completing
the vegetative land use analysis required by  779.22 (land use information). (44 FR 15037, March 13, 1979).
In revisiting this issue in its proposed rule, OSM justified the deletion of  779.19 on the grounds that it was
felt to be redundant and that other specified permit application provisions provide the regulatory authority with
sufficient authority to require the level of detailed information necessary to complete  779.22(a)'s vegetative
land use information requirements.
Numerous comments were received strongly opposing this deletion. The commenters stressed that the information
of   779.19 and 779.22 was ``complementary and not duplicative.'' The commenters expressed their view
that section 779.19 serves an essential and wider purpose than merely helping to complete  779.22(a)'s land
use information requirements. These commenters further questioned whether the other permit application provisions
cited by OSM in its proposed rule actually provide the regulatory authority with sufficient authority to require
the detailed information relative to species diversity and ground cover which is needed to properly evaluate an operator's
ability to revegetate the disturbed area. In light of the comments opposing the proposed deletion of  779.19,
OSM has determined to retain that section unaffected by this rulemaking.


C. Premining Slope Measurement

This rulemaking deletes section 30 CFR 779.25(a)(11) (Cross sections, maps, and plans) requiring slope measurements.
OSM recognizes that premining slope measurements are needed to ensure that restored contours meet approximate original
contour (AOC) conditions. The former rule was, however, redundant as it provided no additional information beyond
that already available to the regulatory authority under 30 CFR 777.14(a) and OSM's technical information processing
system (TIPS). In the 1979 preamble to  779.25, OSM acknowledged that the required slope measurements could
be derived from existing topographic maps or from measurements taken in the field (44 FR 15045, March 13, 1979). Since
that time, OSM has found that most permit applicants derive the required measurements from a topographic map rather
than from field measurements. Section 777.14(a) requires a permit applicant to submit a topographic map of the permit
area which includes U.S. Geological Survey topographic features. Therefore, it makes no difference whether the
applicant measures the slope from a topographic map, in fulfillment of the requirements under  779.25(a)(11),
or the regulatory authority measures the slope from the same or similar topographic map submitted under  777.14(a)
so long as the regulatory authority has adequate information on the slope of the proposed permit area to assure that
approximate original contour will be achieved. Subsequent to the 1979 promulgation and issuance of  779.25(a)(11),
OSM has also made available to regulatory authorities the TIPS software and data analysis capabilities which allows
both premining slopes and cross sections to be computed.


Several commenters agreed with the proposal to delete  779.25(a)(11) as they felt that the information is already
available to the regulatory authority independent of any submission by the applicant. One commenter opposed the
proposal on the basis that it is the operator's responsibility to supply the baseline slope measurement data. However,
as discussed above, the operator is already required by  777.14(a) to supply the appropriate topographic maps
of the permit area which represent the baseline information for slope measurement calculations. All regulatory
authorities also have access to TIPS systems and have the capability to calculate premining slopes and cross sections
from the topographic maps provided. This same commenter alleged that the operator may not be able to demonstrate AOC
if the regulatory authority is the only party with the slope data. OSM does not agree. Irrespective of the deletion
of  779.25(a)(11), the permit applicant must demonstrate in the plan, under the requirement of  816.102,
the ability to meet the performance standards for AOC. Thus, the deletion of this section does not relieve the applicant
of the responsibility to demonstrate how AOC is achieved in the reclamation plan.



IV. Procedural Matters



Federal Paperwork Reduction Act



The collections of information contained in this rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under
44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

and assigned clearance numbers 1029-0035 and 1029-0038.




Executive Order 12866



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act




The Department of Interior has determined, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

., that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The final
rule consolidates requirements for premining and postmining land use and thereby eliminates redundancies in the
regulations with a resulting reduction in the reporting burden on the public. This should result in a cost savings
to the public.




National Environmental Policy Act



OSM has prepared an environmental assessment (EA), and has made a finding that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42
U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). The EA and finding of no significant impact are on file in the OSM Administrative Record, room 660,
800 North Capitol Street NW., Washington, DC.
