OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Reduction in Force Permissive Temporary Exception



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing regulations that would give agencies broader authority to
use permissive temporary exceptions to the regular order of release in reduction in force (RIF) competition. These
proposed regulations would assist an agency in meeting a Government obligation to an employee (such as delaying the
effective date of an employee's release by RIF long enough to allow a full 60- or 120-day notice to the employee). These
proposed regulations would also allow an agency to consider only subgroup standing in releasing employees during
the 120-day period immediately before an installation closes.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The liquidation provision is contained in section 5 CFR 351.605. Under the current regulations, a liquidation situation
exists when an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 90 days. In separating employees by RIF,
the agency must release employees in group and subgroup order consistent with 5 CFR 351.601(a). However, the liquidation
provision permits the agency, at its discretion, to release employees within a subgroup regardless of the employees'
relative retention standing for up to 90 days before closure of an activity. An agency may not apply this section to
release an employee who is entitled to retention in the subgroup under section 5 CFR 351.606 because of reemployment
after military service.




We are proposing to revise section 5 CFR 351.605 to provide that the liquidation provisions are applicable when an
agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 120 days. This change conforms with section 4433 of
Public Law 102-484, which provides that employees of the Department of Defense are entitled to a minimum specific
RIF notice period of 120 days when a significant number of employees will be separated.

The present provisions covering permissive temporary exceptions are contained in  351.608, as revised January
22, 1993, at 58 FR 5561. Section 351.608(b)(3) would be revised to delete the restriction that an agency may use a permissive
temporary exception for not more than 90 days to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained employee.

Present  351.608(c) would be redesignated as  351.608(d) and present  351.608(d) would be redesignated
as  351.608(e). Section 351.608(c) would be added to provide that an agency may use a permissive temporary exception
without time limitation to satisfy a Government obligation to the retained employee. This new section also conforms
to the longer RIF notice requirement applicable to certain employees of the Department of Defense under section 4433
of Public Law 102-484.

2. Section 351.605 is revised to read as follows:


 351.605

Liquidation provisions.


When an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 120 days, it must release employees in group
and subgroup order consistent with  351.601(a). At its discretion, the agency may release the employees in
group order without regard to retention standing within a subgroup, except as provided in  351.606. When an
agency releases an employee under this section, the notice to the employee must cite this authority and give the date
the liquidation will be completed. An agency may also apply  351.607 and  351.608 in a liquidation.

3. In  351.608, paragraphs (c) and (d) are redesignated as paragraphs (d) and (e) respectively, paragraph (b)
is revised, and paragraph (c) is added to read as follows:


 351.608

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Hamilton Standard
14RF, 247F, 14SF, and 6/5500/F (formerly Hamilton Standard/British Aerospace 6/5500/F) series propellers, that
currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal
spline (BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo BIS assemblies. This action would increase
the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in service (TIS) since last inspection for propellers
that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. This proposal is prompted by the availability of improved hardware
that enhances the lubrication of the BIS and significantly reduces BIS wear. The actions specified by the proposed
AD are intended to prevent inability to control the propeller blade angle due to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS assembly.

Discussion 


On August 13, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93-16-02,
Amendment 39-8659 (58 FR 44441, August 23, 1993), to require initial and repetitive inspections of the propeller
control unit (PCU) servo ballscrew internal spline (BIS) teeth for wear, and replacement, if necessary, of PCU servo
BIS assemblies. That action was prompted by a report of an incident where the crew experienced difficulties in feathering
and controlling the propeller blade angle. Investigation of the PCU servo BIS assembly revealed excessively worn
spline teeth. That condition, if not corrected, could result in inability to control the propeller blade angle due
to tooth wear in the PCU servo BIS assembly. 
Since the issuance of that AD, Hamilton Standard has developed a damper to be installed between the end of the ballscrew
and the shoulder of the quill shaft. The damper preloads the quill against the retaining ring and eliminates axial
motion between the quill and the ballscrew. This reduces vibration, enhances ballscrew lubrication, and results
in an extension of the useful life of the BIS assembly. 
In addition, the manufacturer has issued revisions to the alert service bulletins (ASB) referenced in the current
AD. The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of the following Hamilton Standard ASB's, all dated April
7, 1994: No. 14SF-61-A59, Revision 4; No. 14RF-9-61-A53, Revision 5; No. 14RF-19-61-A25,
Revision 4; No. 14RF-21-61-A38, Revision 4; No. 247F-61-A3, Revision 3; and No. 6/5500/F-61-A11,
Revision 4. These revisions enable affected propellers with a ballscrew quill damper installed in accordance with
the following Hamilton Standard SB's to extend the repetitive inspection interval from 500 to 1,500 hours time in
service (TIS) since last inspection: No. 14SF-61-67, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 14RF-9-61-61,
dated December 9, 1993; No. 14RF-19-61-29, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 14RF-21-61-48,
Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; No. 247F-61-6, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994; and No. 6/5500/F-61-19,
Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93-16-02 to increase the repetitive inspection interval from
500 to 1,500 hours TIS since last inspection for propellers that have a ballscrew quill damper installed. 
There are approximately 2,506 propellers of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1150
propellers installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
1.5 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, and on the average utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year equating to 4 inspections, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD per inspection on U.S. operators is estimated to be $379,500. However, based on an average
utilization rate of 2,000 hours TIS per year, the proposed AD would eliminate 2.7 inspections per year per propeller,
resulting in an approximate yearly cost savings to U.S. operators of $256,163. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, System Management Branch, ANM-530, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055-4056.
Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list
for future NPRM'S should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application
procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class
E airspace description for Ephrata Municipal Airport, Ephrata, Washington. A review of the airspace description
revealed an overlap of airspace between Ephrata Municipal Airport, Washington, and Moses Lake, Grant County Airport,
Washington. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations
for airspace areas designated as a surface area for an airport are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A
dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298;
July 6, 1993). The Class E designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend Class E airspace
at Spokane, Washington to accommodate arrival/departure aircraft transitioning between the en route and terminal
areas in Eastern Washington. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the
use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth
is now Class E airspace. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for
this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or
more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking by cross-reference to temporary regulations. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

, the Internal Revenue Service is issuing temporary regulations relating to the substantiation requirement for
certain charitable contributions under section 170(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code. The guidance contained
in those temporary regulations affects donors of charitable contributions of $250 or more. The text of the temporary
regulations also serves as the comment document for this notice of proposed rulemaking. Comments will be considered
not only on the temporary rules promulgated, but also on other issues arising under section 170(f)(8). These issues
include, but are not limited to, (a) what constitutes a good faith estimate of the value of goods and services, (b) what
is an intangible religious benefit, and (c) what is a contemporaneous acknowledgment. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act 


The collection of information contained in these regulations has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection
of information should be sent to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC
20503, with copies to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224.

The collection of information in this notice of proposed rulemaking is in  1.170A-13T. This information
is required by the Internal Revenue Service to substantiate certain charitable contributions. The likely recordkeepers
are individuals, business or other for-profit institutions, and small businesses. 
Estimated total annual recordkeeping burden: 51,500 hours. The estimated annual burden per recordkeeper varies
from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated average of 30 minutes. Estimated
number of recordkeepers: 16,000. 


Background 


For the text of the temporary regulations adding  1.170A-13T to 26 CFR part 1, see TD 8544, published in
the Rules and Regulations section of this issue of the 

Federal Register

. The preamble to the temporary regulations explains the regulations. 


Special Analyses 


It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
Executive Order 12866. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.
chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore,
an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these proposed regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business. 


Comments and Request for a Public Hearing 


Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments
that are timely submitted (preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All comments
will be available for public inspection and copying in their entirety. A public hearing will be scheduled and held
upon written request by any person who timely submits written comments on the proposed rules. Notice of the date, time,
and place for the hearing will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of these proposed regulations is Joel S. Rutstein, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel (Income
Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service. However, other personnel from the Service and Treasury Department
participated in their development.

Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a permanent safety and security zone on Lake Michigan, over all waters and shoreline
areas within 1000 yards of the shoreline surrounding Merrill C. Meigs Airfield. This zone is needed to safeguard all
vessels and waterfront facilities in these areas against destruction, loss, or injury from sabotage or other subversive
acts, accidents, or other causes of a similar nature. This safety and security zone will be in effect at various times;
these times will be published in the Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners or broadcasted via Marine Radio VHF-FM
Channels 16 & 22. When in effect, entry into this zone in prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port
Chicago.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Request for Comments 



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments which may
consist of data, views, arguments, or proposals for amendments to the proposed regulation. The Coast Guard does not
currently plan to have a public hearing, but consideration will be given to holding such a hearing if it is requested.
Such a request should indicate how a public hearing would contribute substantial information or views which cannot
be received in written form. If it appears that a public hearing would substantially contribute to revisions or further
refinements of this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will announce such a hearing by a later notice in the 

Federal Register. 



Background and Purpose 



The purpose of this regulation is to support the U.S. Secret service in performing statutory protective duties. The
goal is ensure the safety and security of the President and other officials that may periodically arrive at Merrill
C. Meigs Airfield on short notice; and to protect all members of the public in the area. This safety and security zone
will be in affect at various times; these times will be published in the Coast Guard Local Notice to Mariners or broadcasted
via Marine Radio VHF-FM Channels 16 & 22. This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 and 50 U.S.C
191 as a set out in the authority citation for all 33 CFR part 165. 



Drafting Information 



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant (junior grade) Benjamin L. Smith, Project
Manager, and Commander Robert G. Blythe, Project Counsel. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.




Federalism 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. This regulation does not impose any new regulatory requirements in an
area not heretofore regulated by the Federal Government, and does not impose any requirements or restrictions on
State or local authorities. 



Regulatory Evaluation 


Proposal is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and
Review and is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034
of February 26, 1979).

Small Entities



The impact of this regulation is expected to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The Coast
Guard therefore certifies that, if adopted, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Regulation. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Library of Congress is authorized to collect debts owed by current and former staff members to the Federal Government
by making deductions from the current pay account of the individual. The Library of Congress issues this proposed
regulation to prescribe the procedures the Library will follow when collecting a debt owed to the Federal Government
via deductions from an employee's pay. It also describes the rights of current employees, former employees who owe
debts to other agencies, and former employees who are currently employed by other agencies in the collection of debts
owed to the Federal Government by them and sets out the procedures for collecting debts through deductions from their
pay following due process.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 5514 of title 5 U.S.C. and 5 CFR 550.1101, when an agency head or his/her designee determines that an employee
is indebted to the Federal Government, he/she will authorize the collection of that indebtedness in monthly installments
or at officially established pay intervals, by deduction from the current pay account of the individual. The amount
deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a greater percentage may be deducted
upon the written consent of the individual involved. If the individual retires or resigns, or if his employment otherwise
ends, before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, deductions shall be made from subsequent
payments of any nature due the individual from the agency concerned. This proposed Regulation sets out the procedures
the Library of Congress will follow when collecting debts through deductions from the employee's pay following due
process.

(c) 

Procedures_

(1) 

Notification of indebtedness.

 The Director of Human Resources, or designee, shall notify the staff member, in writing, of the individual's indebtedness
to the Library and the intention of the Library to collect this debt by deductions from the individual's pay. This notice
shall be given not less than 30 days before any deduction is made. This notice shall state, at a minimum: 
(i) The Library's determination that a debt is owed, including the origin, nature, and amount of the debt; 
(ii) The Library's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction from the staff member's disposable pay account;

(iii) The amount, frequency, proposed beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions; 
(iv) An explanation of the Library's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, including
a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused; 
(v) The staff member's right to inspect and to copy Government records relating to the debt or, if he or she or his or her
representative cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of such records; 
(vi) If not previously provided, the opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Library) to establish a schedule for
the voluntary repayment of the debt or to enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for the repayment of
the debt in lieu of offset (the agreement must be in writing, signed by both the staff member and the Library, and documented
in the Library's files); 
(vii) The staff member's right to a hearing conducted by an official arranged for or engaged by the Library (an administrative
law judge or, alternatively, a hearing official not under the control of the Librarian of Congress) if a petition is
filed as prescribed by the Library; 
(viii) The method and time period for petitioning for a hearing; 
(ix) That the timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay the commencement of collection proceedings; 
(x) That a final decision on the hearing, if one is requested, will be issued at the earliest practicable date, but not
later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing unless the staff member requests and the
hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

(xiii) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted
for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the staff member;

(xiv) That if the staff member elects not to contest the determination of indebtedness or the amount or the terms of
a repayment schedule, the staff member may still wish to exercise the right to request a waiver of the collection of
the indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of Library of Congress Regulation 1556, Claims (if the amount of the indebtedness
exceeds $1,500, the staff member should be advised that a final determination must be made by the Comptroller General
of the United States); and 
(xv) That any involuntary payments already made or withheld from salary of any portion of the indebtedness will not
be construed as a waiver by the staff member of any rights that he or she may have under this part. 
(2) 

Amount of deduction.

 If possible, the debt shall be collected in one lump sum. If multiple deductions are necessary, however, the amount
deducted from a staff member's pay for any single period will not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a
greater percentage may be deducted upon the written consent of the individual involved. The staff member may enter
into a written agreement for a repayment schedule different from that proposed so long as the terms are approved by
the Library. If the individual retires or resigns or if his or her employment otherwise ends before collection of the
amount of the indebtedness is completed, deduction shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature due the individual.

(3) 

Petitions for hearing.

 (i) To elect a hearing, the staff member must notify the Director, Human Resources, no later than 15 days after the receipt
of the notification of indebtedness. A timely filing of a petition for hearing will stay any further commencement
of collection proceedings. A final decision on the hearing will be issued at the earliest practicable date, but not
later than 60 days after the filing of petition, unless the individual requests and the hearing official grants a delay
in the proceedings. 
(ii) The petition or statement must be signed by the staff member and must fully identify and explain with reasonable
specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, which he or she believes supports his or her position.

(iii) Petitions for hearings made later than 15 days after the receipt of the notification of indebtedness will be
accepted provided the staff member can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or
because of failure to receive notice of the time limit (unless otherwise aware of it). 
(4) 

Form of hearings and final decisions.

 (i) The staff member shall be provided an appropriate hearing as decided by the hearing official, based on the nature
of the transactions giving rise to the debt. The hearing official shall be guided by the procedures set out in 4 CFR 102.3(c)
in deciding on the type of hearing to provide. 
(ii) A written decision will be provided to the staff member and must, at a minimum, state the fact(s) purported to support
the nature and origin of the alleged debt; the hearing official's analysis, findings, and conclusions, in light of
the hearing, as to the staff member's or the Library's grounds; the amount and validity of the alleged debt; and, where
applicable, the repayment schedule. 
(d) 

Creditor agency is not the Library of Congress.

 When the Library receives from a creditor agency a debt claim properly certified in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1108(a),
deductions shall be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. The Director, Human Resources,
shall provide the employee with written notice stating that the Library has received a certified debt claim from the
creditor agency (including the amount) and written notice of the date deductions from salary will commence and of
the amount of such deductions. When the Library receives an incomplete debt claim from a creditor agency, the Director,
Human Resources, shall return the debt claim with a written notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 must be followed
and a properly determined debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's pay account.

(e) 

Exclusions and exceptions.

 (1) This part does not apply to debts where collection of the debt is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another
statute, or to debts of $1 or less, which, it is hereby determined, is not cost effective to attempt to collect (65 Comp.
Gen. 843, September 29, 1986). 
(2) An exception to the entitlement of notice, hearings, written responses, and final decisions provided for under
paragraph (c) of this section is made for overpayments arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change
in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered
was accumulated over four pay periods or less.

Revision of Patent Fees 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is proposing 
to amend the rules of practice in patent cases, Part 1 of 
title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, to adjust certain 
patent fee amounts to reflect fluctuations in the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) and to recover costs of operation. No 
trademark fees will be affected by this rulemaking. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed rule change is 
designed to adjust the PTO fees in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of title 35, United States Code, and 
section 10101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1990 (Public Law 101-508), as amended by the Patent and 
Trademark Office Authorization Act of 1991 (Public Law 
102-204). 



Background 





Statutory Provisions:

 Patent fees are authorized by 35 
U.S.C. 41 and 35 U.S.C. 376. A fifty percent reduction in 
the fees paid under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 41(b) by independent 
inventors, small business concerns, and nonprofit 
organizations who meet prescribed definitions is required by 
35 U.S.C. 41(h). 

Subsection 41(f) of title 35, United States Code, provides 
that fees established under 
35 U.S.C. 41(a) and (b) may be adjusted on October 1, 1992, 
and every year thereafter, to reflect fluctuations in the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the previous 12 months. 

Section 10101 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 
1990 (Pub. L. 101-508) provides that there shall be a 
surcharge on all fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 
41(b) to collect $107 million in fiscal year 1995. 

For fiscal year 1995, the PTO has proposed appropriation 
language that credits directly to the agency all patent fee 
surcharges collected pursuant to sections 10101(a) and (c) 
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 
101-508). Under the proposal, the PTO will not request 
appropriations from fees deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund 
as has been the practice from fiscal years 1991 through 
1994. 

Subsection 41(d) of title 35, United States Code, authorizes 
the Commissioner to establish fees for all other processing, 
services, or materials related to patents to recover the 
average cost of providing these services or materials, 
except for the fees for recording a document affecting 
title, for each photocopy, and for each black and white copy 
of a patent. 

Section 376 of title 35, United States Code, authorizes the 
Commissioner to set fees for patent applications filed under 
the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). 

Subsection 41(g) of title 35, United States Code, provides 
that new fee amounts established by the Commissioner under 
Section 41 may take effect thirty days after notice in the 


Federal Register

 and the Official Gazette of the Patent and 
Trademark Office. 



Recovery Level Determinations:

 The proposed rule would 
adjust fees for a planned recovery of $571,439,000 in fiscal 
year 1995, as proposed in the Administration's budget 
request to the Congress. 

The patent statutory fees established by 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 
41(b) are proposed to be adjusted on October 1, 1994, to 
reflect any fluctuations occurring during the previous 12 
months in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). In calculating 
these fluctuations, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
has determined that the PTO should use CPI-U data as 
determined by the Secretary of Labor. However, the 
Department of Labor does not make public the CPI-U until 
approximately 21 days after the end of the month being 
calculated. Therefore, the latest CPI-U information 
available is for the month of April 1994. In accordance with 
previously proposed rulemaking methodology, the PTO uses the 
Administration's projected CPI-U for the 12-month period 
ending September 30, 1994, which is 3.0 percent. Based on 
this projection, patent statutory fees are proposed to be 
adjusted by 3.0 percent. Before the final fee schedule is 
published, the fees may be slightly adjusted based on actual 
data available from the Department of Labor. 

The proposed patent statutory fee amounts were rounded by 
applying standard arithmetic rules so that the amounts 
rounded would be convenient to the user. Fees of $100 or 
more were rounded to the nearest $10. Fees between $2 and 
$99 were rounded to an even number so that the comparable 
small entity fee would be a whole number. 

Certain non-statutory patent processing fees established 
under 35 U.S.C. 41(d) and PCT processing fees established 
under 35 U.S.C. 376 are proposed to be adjusted up to the 
three percent fluctuation in the CPI in order to recover 
their estimated average costs in 1995. Three patent service 
fees that are set by statute will not be adjusted. The 
three fees that are not being adjusted are assignment 
recording fees, printed patent copy fees and photocopy 
charge fees.

Workload Projections:

 Determination of workloads varies by 
fee. Principal workload projection techniques are as 
follows: 

Patent application workloads are projected from statistical 
regression models using recent application filing trends. 
Patent issues are projected from an in-house patent 
production model and reflect examiner production 
achievements and goals. Patent maintenance fee workloads 
utilize patents issued 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years prior to 
payment and assume payment rates of 80 percent, 57 percent 
and 25 percent, respectively. Service fee workloads follow 
linear trends from prior years' activities. 



General Procedures:

 Any fee amount that is paid on or after 
the effective date of the fee increase, would be subject to 
the new fees then in effect. For purposes of determining 
the amount of the fee to be paid, the date of mailing 
indicated on a proper Certificate of Mailing or 
Transmission, where authorized under 37 CFR 1.8, will be 
considered to be the date of receipt in the PTO. A 
Certificate of Mailing or Transmission under Section 1.8 is 
not ``proper'' for items which are specifically excluded from 
the provisions of Section 1.8. Section 1.8 should be 
consulted for those items for which a Certificate of Mailing 
or Transmission is not proper.'' Such items include, inter 
alia, the filing of national and international applications 
for patents. However, the provisions of 37 CFR 1.10 
relating to filing papers and fees with an ``Express Mail'' 
certificate do apply to any paper or fee (including patent 
applications) to be filed in the PTO. If an application or 
fee is filed by ``Express Mail'' with a proper certificate 
dated on or after the effective date of the rules, as 
amended, the amount of the fee to be paid would be the fee 
established by the amended rules. 

A comparison of existing and proposed fee amounts is 
included as an Appendix to this notice of proposed 
rulemaking. 

In order to ensure clarity in the implementation of the 
proposed fees, a discussion of specific sections is set 
forth below. 



DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC RULES 



37 CFR 1.16 National application filing fees. 



Section 1.16, paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (f)-(i), if 
revised as proposed, would adjust fees established therein to reflect 
fluctuations in the CPI. 



37 CFR 1.17 Patent application processing fees. 



Section 1.17, paragraphs (b)-(g) and (m), if revised as 
proposed, would adjust fees established therein to reflect 
fluctuations in the CPI. 

Section 1.17, paragraphs (j), and (n)-(p), if revised as 
proposed, would adjust fees established therein to recover 
costs. 



37 CFR 1.18 Patent issue fees. 



Section 1.18, paragraphs (a)-(c), if revised as proposed, 
would adjust fees established therein to reflect 
fluctuations in the CPI. 



37 CFR 1.20 Post-issuance fees. 



Section 1.20, paragraphs (c), (i)(1), and (j), if revised as 
proposed, would adjust fees established therein to recover 
costs. 

Section 1.20, paragraphs (e)-(g), if revised as proposed, 
would adjust fees established therein to reflect 
fluctuations in the CPI. 



37 CFR 1.445 International application filing, processing, 
and search fees. 



Section 1.445, paragraph (a), if revised as proposed, would 
adjust the fees authorized by 35 U.S.C. 376 to recover 
costs. 



37 CFR 1.482 International preliminary examination fees. 



Section 1.482, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii), if revised 
as proposed, would adjust the fees authorized by 35 U.S.C. 
376 to recover costs. 



37 CFR 1.492 National stage fees. 



Section 1.492, paragraphs (a), (b) and (d), if revised as 
proposed, would adjust fees established therein to reflect 
fluctuations in the CPI. 



Other Considerations 



This proposed rule change is in 
conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 12612, 
and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et 
seq. There are no information collection requirements 
relating to patent fee rules. This proposed rule has been 
determined not to be significant for purposes of Executive 
Order 12866. 

The PTO has determined that this proposed rule change has no 
Federalism implications affecting the relationship between 
the National Government and the States as outlined in 
Executive Order 12612. 

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has 
certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business 
Administration, that the rule change would not have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities 
(Regulatory Flexibility Act,


Pub. L. 96-354). The proposed 
rule change increases fees by changes in the CPI as 
authorized by 35 U.S.C. 41(f). Further, the principal 
impact of the major patent fees has already been taken into 
account in 35 U.S.C. 41(h), which provides small entities 
with a 50-percent reduction in the major patent fees.

Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of inquiry.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Inquity (

Inquiry

) in CS Docket No. 94-48 results from a directive to the Commission included in the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (``1992 Cable Act''), to prepare snd submit a report on the status of competition
in the market for the delivery of video programming to Congress, 18 months after promulgation of the program access
regulations, or, October 1, 1994, and annually, thereafter. In this 

Inquiry

, the Commission intends to gather information to prepare a preliminary analysis on the current state of competition
to cable television provided by alternative distribution technologies, to collect data and information on the practices
of video programming vendors and distributors, to identify the information required to write subsequent comprehensive
annual reports to Congress, and to identify the appropriate means for collecting such information in the future.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Inquiry (

Inquiry

) in CS Docket No. 94-48, adopted May 19, 1994, and released May 19, 1994. The full text of this 

Inquiry

 is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919
M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.


Synopsis of Notice of Inquiry 


1. The 

Inquiry 

stesses that a primary goal of the 1992 Cable Act was to promote increased competition in the delivery of cable television
services. Section 19(g) of the 1992 Cable Act directed the Commission to annually report to Congress on the status
of competition in the market for the delivery of video programming. The first report must be submitted to Congress
no later than October 1, 1994. The Commission believes that it must engage in an ongoing process of evaluating the status
of competition to cable television in order to meet this annual reporting requirement. 
2. The goals of this 

Inquiry

 are threefold: (1) To gather information sufficient to prepare a preliminary analysis for Congress of the current
state of competition to cable provided by alternative distribution technologies; (2) to collect information on
whether and the extent to which the conduct and practices of multichannel video programming vendors and distributors
have changed; and (3) to identify the information required to enable the Commission to prepare more comprehensive
analyses in our future reports and the appropriate means of obtaining it. 
3. The 

Inquiry

 asks questions about the suitable means of analyzing the relevant programming and distribution markets. To assist
the Commission in conducting its analysis, the 

Inquiry

 seeks comment on relevant economic methodologies, including structure-conduct-performance analyses and their
complementary antitrust concepts, contestable market theory, and transaction cost economics. 
4. The 

Inquiry

 also seeks to establish a reference point for future comparisons of the status of the multichannel video programming
marketplace by updating the information contained in Appendix G of the Commission's 1990 Cable Report to Congress
(``1990 Report'') with respect to horizontal ownership levels and vertical integration. 55 FR 32631 (8/10/90).

5. For this first annual report to Congress, the Commission will undertake a preliminary assessment of the status
of competition at the local level in the video programming marketplace. The 

Inquiry

 notes that competition to cable television is currently provided to a limited extent by ``wireless cable'' systems,
high-power and medium-power direct broadcast satellite (``DBS'') services, direct-to-home satellite services,
satellite master antenna television (``SMATV'') systems, telephone technologies (such as video dialtone), cable
overbuilds, and over-the-air television broadcasting. 
6. The 

Inquiry

 notes that there have been various significant technological changes since the 1990 Report. For example, since local
telephone exchange carriers are now seen as providing competition to cable, the 

Inquiry

 seeks comment on how the Commission should approach and address video dialtone in the context of its report. Also,
the 

Inquiry

 addresses digital compression, as well as entry into the video programming distribution market by other providers
such as electric or other utility companies, and the implications of their entry.

7. With respect to analysis of horizontal ownership and vertical integration in the cable industry, the 

Inquiry

 notes that substantial reliance was placed on the 1990 Report when establishing the subscriber and channel occupancy
limits. The 

Inquiry

 seeks to gather data to create a baseline that may be used to provide a comprehensive report, and that will also aid the
Commission in its periodic review of the appropriateness of those limits.

8. In addition, the 

Inquiry

 proposes to gather information on the existence and extent of affiliations, including, but not limited to, investments,
joint ventures, and partnerships between multichannel video programming distributors and other communications
companies. Comment is sought on how these and other types of business relationships will affect the cost, quality,
and variety of video programming. The 

Inquiry

 acknowledges that some information that could be requested might include proprietary or otherwise confidential
information or data. Comment is requested on how the Commission should gather, examine, protect or release such information
and data, and on possible methods for protecting individual confidentiality.

9. The 

Inquiry

 seeks comments on the effect that the 1992 Cable Act and the Commission's implementing rules, and the effect of the
changes in the multichannel video marketplace resulting from the 1992 Act and rules, have had on the entry and development
of competitors in the marketplace, 

e.g., 

negotiations, sales, marketing, and carriage practices.

10. The 

Inquiry

 also seeks to determine whether anticompetitive practices in the multichannel video programming and distribution
markets have diminished, and whether new and potentially anticompetitive conduct has developed. To the extent commenters
express continued concerns about the existence of undue market power by cable operators, other multichannel video
programming distributors, or vertically integrated programming vendors engaging in conduct that is not encompassed
within the Commission's rules, they are requested to suggest regulatory responses that will address them.

11. Since the 

Inquiry

 acknowledges that it may be desirable in the future to establish more systematic reporting procedures, it seeks comments
on specific studies, survey methodologies, etc. that the Commission might undertake to gather the information that
will enable it to prepare accurate and comprehensive reports. The 

Inquiry

 seeks comment on whether the Commission should adopt annual reporting requirements on various licensees providing
multichannel video programming distribution services and on vertically integrated programming vendors, and what
such reporting requirements should entail.

12. The 

Inquiry

 emphasizes that the Commission wishes to gather and compile all of this information without unduly burdening the
information providers. Thus, the 

Inquiry

 seeks comment on the least intrusive means for gathering the necessary information and data.

Listing Endangered and Threatened Species and Designating Critical Habitat: Petition To List Steelhead Throughout
its Range in Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of finding; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS has received a petition to list steelhead (

Oncorhynchus

 

mykiss

) throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho and to designate critical habitat under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973 (ESA). In accordance with section 4 of the ESA, NMFS has determined that the petition presents substantial
scientific information indicating that the request for a listing may be warranted. Therefore, NMFS is initiating
a status review to determine if the petitioned action is warranted. To ensure that the review is comprehensive, NMFS
is soliciting information and data regarding this action. Information received during the comment period for this
status review will be used in NMFS' ongoing review of coastal steelhead populations in California, Oregon, and Washington
(including Puget Sound).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




Background


Section 4 of the ESA contains provisions allowing interested persons to petition the Secretary of the Interior or
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to add a species to or remove a species from the List of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife and to designate critical habitat. Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the maximum extent practicable,
within 90 days after receiving such a petition, the Secretary determine whether the petition presents substantial
scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted.


Petition Received


On February 16, 1994, the Secretary received a petition from the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC) and 15 co-petitioners
to list steelhead (

O

. 

mykiss

) throughout its range in Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho and to designate critical habitat under the ESA.
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) found that the petition presents substantial scientific
information indicating that a listing may be warranted based on the criteria specified in 50 CFR 424.14(b)(2), and
based on evidence presented in the petition that the petitioned populations may qualify as a ``species'' under the
ESA in accordance with NMFS' ``Policy on Applying the Definition of Species Under the Endangered Species Act to Pacific
Salmon'' (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991). Under section 4(b)(3)(B) of the ESA, this finding requires that a review
of the status of steelhead populations in Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho be conducted to determine if
the petitioned action is warranted. In keeping with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the ESA, the Secretary will make his determination
on the ONRC 

et

 

al

. petition within 12 months of February 16, 1994, the date it was received.


Ongoing Status Review


On May 6, 1992, the Secretary received a petition from ONRC and ten co-petitioners to list the Illinois River (tributary
to the Rogue River, Southern Oregon) winter steelhead and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. The AA determined
that while ``there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Illinois River winter steelhead by themselves
represent an evolutionary significant unit (ESU), and hence a 'species' under the ESA, Illinois River winter steelhead
are undoubtedly part of a larger ESU whose extent has not yet been determined.'' Moreover, in light of the general decline
in many West Coast populations of steelhead, NMFS initiated its own comprehensive status review that will assess
steelhead populations in coastal streams of California, Oregon, and Washington (including Puget Sound). The first
objective of the larger steelhead status review is to define the boundaries of the ESU that contain Illinois River
winter steelhead and determine whether they are threatened or endangered. In accordance with section 4 of the ESA,
NMFS published a notice of determination and request for information (58 FR 29390, May 20, 1993) on an expanded status
review of coastal steelhead populations. Although the geographic scope of the ONRC 

et

 

al

. petition is similar to the area addressed in the ongoing NMFS coastal steelhead status review, additional information
about steelhead populations east of the Cascade Mountain Range is needed. Therefore, information received during
the comment period for the ONRC 

et

 

al

. petition will be used in NMFS' ongoing review of steelhead populations in coastal streams of California, Oregon,
and Washington (including Puget Sound). 


Listing Factors and Basis for Determination


Under section 4(a)(1) of the ESA, a species can be determined to be endangered or threatened for any of the following
reasons: (1) Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (2) overutilization
for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (3) disease or predation; (4) inadequacy of
existing regulatory mechanisms; or (5) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. All
listing determinations are made solely on the best scientific and commercial data available.


Biological Information Solicited


NMFS is soliciting information and comments concerning: (1) Whether or not the stocks qualify as a ``species'' under
the ESA (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991) and (2) whether or not the stocks are endangered or threatened based on the above
listing criteria. Specifically, NMFS is soliciting information in the following areas: Migration timing and behavior
of juvenile and adult steelhead; age structure of steelhead; interactions of steelhead with other salmonids; alteration
of steelhead freshwater and marine habitats; disease epizootiology of steelhead; influence of historical and present
hatchery fish releases on naturally spawning stocks of steelhead; and separation of hatchery and natural steelhead
escapement. This information should address all steelhead populations in California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho,
and British Columbia. Because a very similar request for information was published in the May 20, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice announcing NMFS' decision to conduct a review of coastal steelhead populations, it is not necessary for parties
to submit the same information for this request. Copies of the petition are available (see 

ADDRESSES

).
It is important to note that the determination to list a species is based solely on the best available scientific and
commercial information regarding a species' status, without reference to possible economic or other impacts of
such a determination (50 CFR 424.11(b)).


Critical Habitat


NMFS is also requesting information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for Washington, Oregon, California,
and Idaho stocks of steelhead (see also October 15, 1991, 56 FR 51684). Areas that include the physical and biological
features essential to the recovery of the species should be identified. Areas outside the present range should also
be identified if such areas are essential to the recovery of the species. Essential features should include, but are
not limited to: (1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light,
minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for reproduction
and rearing of offspring; and (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic
geographical and ecological distributions of the species.
For areas potentially qualifying as critical habitat, NMFS is requesting information describing: (1) the activities
that affect the area or could be affected by the designation, and (2) the economic costs and benefits of additional
requirements of management measures likely to result from the designation.
The economic cost to be considered in the critical habitat designation under the ESA is the probable economic impact
``of the (critical habitat) designation upon proposed or ongoing activities'' (50 CFR 424.19). NMFS must consider
the incremental costs specifically resulting from a critical habitat designation that are above the economic effects
attributable to listing the species. Economic effects attributable to listing include actions resulting from section
7 consultations under the ESA to avoid jeopardy to the species and from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the
ESA. Comments concerning economic impacts should distinguish the costs of listing from the incremental costs that
can be directly attributed to the designation of specific areas as critical habitats.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


A. Summary 


Under section 1886(d) of the Social Security Act (the 
Act), a system of payment for the operating costs of acute 
hospital inpatient stays under Medicare Part A (Hospital 
Insurance) based on prospectively-set rates was established 
effective with hospital cost reporting periods beginning on 
or after October 1, 1983. Under this system, Medicare 
payment for hospital inpatient operating costs is made at a 
predetermined, specific rate for each hospital discharge. 
All discharges are classified according to a list of 
diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The regulations governing 
the hospital inpatient prospective payment system are 
located in 42 CFR part 412. On September 1, 1993, we 
published a final rule with comment period (58 FR 46270) to 
implement changes to the prospective payment system for 
hospital operating costs beginning with Federal fiscal year 
(FY) 1994. 
For cost reporting periods beginning before 
October 1, 1991, hospital inpatient operating costs were the 
only costs covered under the prospective payment system. 
Payment for capital-related costs had been made on a 
reasonable cost basis because, under sections 1886(a)(4) and 
(d)(1)(A) of the Act, those costs had been specifically 
excluded from the definition of inpatient operating costs. 
However, section 4006(b) of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-203) revised 
section 1886(g)(1) of the Act to require that, for hospitals 
paid under the prospective payment system for operating 
costs, capital-related costs would also be paid under a 
prospective payment system effective with cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. As required 
by section 1886(g) of the Act, we replaced the reasonable 
cost-based payment methodology with a prospective payment 
methodology for hospital inpatient capital-related costs. 
Under the new methodology, effective for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a 
predetermined payment amount per discharge is made for 
Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. (See subpart M of 
42 CFR part 412, and the August 30, 1991, final rule (56 FR 
43358) for a complete discussion of the prospective payment 
system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs.) 


B. Major Contents of This Proposed Rule 


In this proposed rule, we are setting forth proposed 
changes to the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective 
payment systems for both operating costs and capital-related 
costs. This proposed rule would be effective for discharges 
occurring on or after October 1, 1994. Following is a 
summary of the major changes that we are proposing to make: 


1. Changes to the DRG Classification and Relative Weights 


As required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act, we 
must adjust the DRG classifications and relative weights at 
least annually. Our proposed changes for FY 1995 are set 
forth in section II of this preamble. 


2. Changes to the Hospital Wage Index 


In section III of this preamble, we discuss revisions 
to the wage index and the annual update of the wage data. 
Specific issues addressed in this section include: 
 FY 1995 wage index update. 
 Changes in the reporting of hospital wage index 
data. 
 Revisions to the wage index based on hospital 
redesignations. 
 Impact of the revised hospital wage index. 
 Occupational mix adjustment. 
 Research on refinements to labor market areas. 
 State labor market options. 


3. Other Changes to the Prospective Payment System for 
Inpatient Operating Costs 


In section IV of this preamble, we discuss several 
provisions of the regulations in 42 CFR parts 412, 413, 485, 
and 489 and set forth certain proposed changes concerning 
the following: 
 Definition of and payment for transfer cases. 
 Review of DRG assignments. 
 National average standardized amounts for FY 1995. 
 Outliers. 
 Rural referral centers. 
 Determination of number of beds in determining the 
indirect medical education adjustment. 
 Disproportionate share adjustment. 
 Changes affecting essential access community 
hospitals (EACHs) and rural primary care hospitals (RPCHs). 
 Clarification of payments to rural referral 
center/EACH hospitals. 
 Direct graduate medical education payment. 
 Other technical changes. 


4. Changes and Clarifications to the Prospective Payment 
System for Capital-Related Costs 


In section V of this preamble, we discuss several 
provisions of the regulations in 42 CFR parts 412 and 413 
and set forth certain proposed changes concerning the 
following: 
 Evaluation of provisions relating to obligated 
capital for hospitals subject to lengthy certificate-of-need 
(CON) process.

5. Changes for Hospitals Excluded from the Prospective 
Payment System 


In section VI of this preamble, we discuss changes to 
the regulations at 42 CFR parts 412 and 413 for hospitals 
and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment 
system. The proposed changes concern the following: 
 New requirements for certain long-term care 
hospitals excluded from the prospective payment systems. 
 Removal of the 1986 malpractice rule. 
 Related technical changes. 


6. Determining Prospective Payment Rates and 
Rate-of-Increase Limits 


In the addendum to this proposed rule, we set forth 
proposed changes to the amounts and factors for determining 
the FY 1995 prospective payment rates for operating costs 
and capital-related costs. We are also proposing new update 
factors for determining the rate-of-increase limits for cost 
reporting periods beginning in FY 1995 for hospitals and 
hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system. 


7. Impact Analysis 


In Appendix A, we set forth an analysis of the impact 
that the proposed changes described in this rule would have 
on affected entities. 


8. Capital Acquisition Model 


Appendix B contains the technical appendix on the 
proposed FY 1995 capital acquisition model and budget 
neutrality adjustment. 


9. Report to Congress on the Update Factor for Prospective 
Payment Hospitals and Hospitals Excluded from the 
Prospective Payment System 


Section 1886(e)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the 
Secretary report to Congress no later than March 1, 1994 on 
our initial estimate of an update factor for FY 1995 for 
both prospective payment hospitals and hospitals excluded 
from the prospective payment system. This report is 
included as Appendix C to this proposed rule. 


10. Proposed Recommendation of Update Factor for Hospital 
Inpatient Operating Costs 


As required by sections 1886 (e)(4) and (e)(5) of the 
Act, Appendix D provides our recommendation of the 
appropriate percentage change for FY 1995 for the following: 
 Large urban, other urban, and rural average 
standardized amounts (and hospital-specific rates applicable 
to sole community hospitals) for hospital inpatient services 
paid for under the prospective payment system for operating 
costs. 
 Target rate-of-increase limits to the allowable 
operating costs of hospital inpatient services furnished by 
hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective 
payment system. 


11. Framework for Capital Update 


In Appendix E, we are setting forth a preliminary 
framework for developing the annual update factor for 
inpatient hospital capital-related costs. 


12. Discussion of Prospective Payment Assessment Commission 
Recommendations 


The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) 
is directed by section 1886(e)(2)(A) of the Act to make 
recommendations on the appropriate percentage change factor 
to be used in updating the average standardized amounts. In 
addition, section 1886(e)(2)(B) of the Act directs ProPAC to 
make recommendations regarding changes in each of the 
Medicare payment policies under which payments to an 
institution are prospectively determined. In particular, 
the recommendations relating to the hospital inpatient 
prospective payment systems are to include recommendations 
concerning the number of DRGs used to classify patients, 
adjustments to the DRGs to reflect severity of illness, and 
changes in the methods under which hospitals are paid for 
capital-related costs. Under section 1886(e)(3)(A) of the 
Act, the recommendations required of ProPAC under sections 
1886(e)(2) (A) and (B) of the Act are to be reported to 
Congress not later than March 1 of each year. 
We are printing ProPAC's March 1, 1994 report, which 
includes its recommendations, as Appendix F of this 
document. The recommendations, and the actions we are 
proposing to take with regard to them (when an action is 
recommended), are discussed in detail in the appropriate 
sections of this preamble, the addendum, or the appendices 
to this proposed rule. See section VII of this preamble for 
specific information concerning where individual 
recommendations are addressed. For a brief summary of the 
ProPAC recommendations, we refer the reader to the beginning 
of the ProPAC report as set forth in Appendix F of this 
proposed rule. ProPAC also produced technical appendices in 
its March 1, 1994 report that provide background material 
and detailed analyses used in preparation of the ProPAC 
recommendations. For further information relating 
specifically to the ProPAC report or to obtain a copy of the 
technical appendices, contact ProPAC at (202) 401-8986.

II. Proposed Changes to DRG Classifications and Relative 
Weights 


A. Background 


Under the prospective payment system, we pay for 
inpatient hospital services on the basis of a rate per 
discharge that varies by the DRG to which a beneficiary's 
stay is assigned. The formula used to calculate payment for 
a specific case takes an individual hospital's payment rate 
per case and multiplies it by the weight of the DRG to which 
the case is assigned. Each DRG weight represents the 
average resources required to care for cases in that 
particular DRG relative to the average resources used to 
treat cases in other DRGs. 
Congress recognized that it would be necessary to 
recalculate the DRG relative weights periodically to account 
for changes in resource consumption. Accordingly, section 
1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act requires that the Secretary adjust 
the DRG classifications and relative weights annually. 
These adjustments are made to reflect changes in treatment 
patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change 
the relative use of hospital resources. The proposed 
changes to the DRG classification system and the proposed 
recalibration of the DRG weights for discharges occurring on 
or after October 1, 1994 are discussed below. 


B. DRG Reclassification 


1. General 


Cases are classified into DRGs for payment under the 
prospective payment system based on the principal diagnosis, 
up to eight additional diagnoses, and up to six procedures 
performed during the stay, as well as age, sex, and 
discharge status of the patient. The diagnosis and 
procedure information is reported by the hospital using 
codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). The 
Medicare fiscal intermediary enters the information into its 
claims system and subjects it to a series of automated 
screens called the Medicare Code Editor (MCE). These 
screens are designed to identify cases that require further 
review before classification into a DRG can be accomplished. 
After screening through the MCE and any further 
development of the claims, cases are classified by the 
GROUPER software program into the appropriate DRG. The 
GROUPER program was developed as a means of classifying each 
case into a DRG on the basis of the diagnosis and procedure 
codes and demographic information (that is, sex, age, and 
discharge status). It is used both to classify past cases 
in order to measure relative hospital resource consumption 
to establish the DRG weights and to classify current cases 
for purposes of determining payment. The records for all 
Medicare hospital inpatient discharges are maintained in the 
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file. The 
data in this file are used to evaluate possible DRG 
classification changes and to recalibrate the DRG weights. 
Currently, cases are assigned to one of 491 DRGs in 25 
major diagnostic categories (MDCs). Most MDCs are based on 
a particular organ system of the body (for example, MDC 6, 
Diseases and Disorders of the Digestive System); however, 
some MDCs are not constructed on this basis since they 
involve multiple organ systems (for example, MDC 22, Burns). 
In general, principal diagnosis determines MDC 
assignment. However, there are four DRGs to which cases are 
assigned on the basis of procedure codes rather than first 
assigning them to an MDC based on the principal diagnosis. 
These are the DRGs for liver and bone marrow transplant 
(DRGs 480 and 481, respectively) and the two DRGs for 
tracheostomies (DRGs 482 and 483). Cases are assigned to 
these DRGs before classification to an MDC. 
Within most MDCs, cases are then divided into surgical 
DRGs (based on a surgical hierarchy that orders individual 
procedures or groups of procedures by resource intensity) 
and medical DRGs. Medical DRGs generally are differentiated 
on the basis of diagnosis and age. Some surgical and 
medical DRGs are further differentiated based on the 
presence or absence of complications or comorbidities 
(hereafter CC). 
Generally, GROUPER does not consider other procedures; 
that is, nonsurgical procedures or minor surgical procedures 
generally not performed in an operating room are not listed 
as operating room (OR) procedures in the GROUPER decision 
tables. However, there are a few non-OR procedures that do 
affect DRG assignment for certain principal diagnoses, such 
as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for patients with a 
principal diagnosis of urinary stones. 
The changes we are proposing to make to the DRG 
classification system for FY 1995 are set forth below. 


2. MDC 2 (Diseases and Disorders of the Eye) 


When a case is coded with a principal diagnosis of 
subcorneal pustular dermatosis (diagnosis code 694.1), it is 
classified to MDC 2 (Diseases and Disorders of the Eye), 
where it is assigned to DRGs 46, 47, and 48 (Other Disorders 
of the Eye).
 We recently received a suggestion from the 
public that we should review the DRG classification of 
subcorneal pustular dermatosis because it is a 
dermatological condition and is not a disease or disorder of 
the eye.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Since this issue involves a possible medical misclassification of a diagnosis, we asked our medical consultants
to evaluate the condition. They determined that subcorneal pustular dermatosis is indeed a dermatological condition
and not an eye condition. Based on their determination and recommendations, we propose to remove diagnosis code 694.1
from its current classification in MDC 2 and assign it to MDC 9 (Diseases and Disorders of the Skin, Subcutaneous Tissue
and Breast). 

In order to determine the appropriate DRG assignment in MDC 9, we first made a clinical evaluation of the medical DRGs.
Based on the current MDC 9 configuration, the only possible DRGs appear to be DRGs 272 and 273 (Major Skin Disorders)
or DRGs 283 and 284 (Minor Skin Disorders). After reviewing the average standardized charges and the types of costs
assigned to DRGs 272 and 273, we believe the best assignment for 694.1 is DRGs 283 and 284. We note that the proposed FY
1995 relative weights of DRGs 46, 47, and 48 (0.7573, 0.4330, and 0.4182, respectively) are approximately equal to
those of DRGs 283 and 284 (0.7142 and 0.4358, respectively). Therefore, we propose to move diagnosis code 694.1 to
DRGs 283 and 284. 



3. MDC 15 (Newborns and Other Neonates with Conditions Originating in the Perinatal Period) 



In the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46283), we stated that we would be evaluating the newborn and neonate DRG classifications
and relative weights for possible improvements. Because of the low volume of cases in these DRGs in the MedPAR file,
we stated that we intended to rely on data bases outside the Medicare claims file to supplement our data. We expect that
any major reclassification changes to MDC 15 will be based on an evaluation of actual neonate case data, including
charges and clinical information. 

As we have not yet completed this evaluation, we will not be proposing our MDC 15 revisions for FY 1995. However, since
publication of the September 1, 1993 final rule, we have received several suggestions from the public concerning
improvements for the neonate DRG classifications. Some commenters suggested that we reevaluate the diagnoses that
are currently considered significant problems in determining the assignment of a neonate case to DRG 390 (Neonate
with Other Significant Problems) rather than DRG 391 (Normal Newborn). These commenters believe that many of the
diagnoses currently assigned to DRG 390 are not truly significant clinically and in terms of resource use. These commenters
also identified specific diagnoses within this group that are problematic. Even though we are not ready to proceed
with a comprehensive proposal for revising MDC 15, we did ask our medical specialists to evaluate the specific conditions
that were identified as problematic in the assignment of newborns to DRG 390. 

Currently, cases of otherwise normal newborns with one of the following diagnoses are assigned to DRG 390 rather than
DRG 391:




752.5_Undescended testicle 

795.4_Other nonspecific abnormal histological findings 

V05.3_Need for prophylactic vaccination against viral hepatitis 

V05.4_Need for prophylactic vaccination against Varicella 

V20.1_Other healthy infant or child receiving care




All of these diagnoses were identified by the commenters as nonsignificant conditions that are either not problems
or require only minimal diagnostic work-up, no treatment, and result in the consumption of minimal or no additional
resources. For these reasons, the commenters believe that these diagnoses should be added to the list of conditions
that may be found as secondary diagnoses for DRG 391. 

Specifically, a healthy newborn with undescended testicles requires only a minimal diagnostic work-up and no treatment
at the time of birth. In addition, the conditions that are assigned to diagnosis code 795.4 (Other nonspecific abnormal
histological findings) are nonsignificant problems and require no additional resources to treat. 

Commenters also pointed out that it has become standard practice to inoculate newborns against viral hepatitis,
and that a prophylactic vaccination against Varicella is normal and routine and does not indicate a problem with the
newborn. Diagnosis code V20.1 is generally used to identify a healthy infant that remains in the hospital for an extended
period of time because of maternal illness, and should not be considered a significant problem. 

All of the conditions listed above were reevaluated on a clinical basis by our medical specialists, who determined
that these diagnoses are not significant problems in neonates. Therefore, we are proposing to add them to the list
of secondary diagnoses that would assign an otherwise normal newborn to DRG 391. 

Based on comments received, we also reevaluated perinatal jaundice (diagnosis codes 774.0 through 774.7) and its
DRG assignments. Currently, all of these diagnosis codes except 774.6 (unspecified fetal and neonatal jaundice)
are considered major problems and are assigned to DRGs 387 (Prematurity with Major Problems) and 389 (Full Term Neonate
with Major Problems). Diagnosis code 774.6 is not considered a significant problem and is assigned to DRG 388 (Prematurity
without Major Problems) and DRG 391. Some commenters did not believe that 774.6 should be assigned to DRG 391 when all
the other perinatal jaundice codes are considered major problems. Other commenters believe that some of the perinatal
jaundice diagnoses that are currently considered major are really not that resource intensive. 

Our medical specialists reevaluated these perinatal jaundice conditions, and, based on their determinations,
we are proposing several revisions to the neonatal DRG assignments. First, the following diagnosis codes would be
removed from the major problems list in DRGs 387 and 389 and would be added to the significant problems list:


 

774.0_Perinatal jaundice from hereditary hemolytic anemias 

774.1_Perinatal jaundice from other excessive hemolysis 

774.2_Neonatal jaundice associated with preterm delivery

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Thus, a premature newborn with one of these codes would be assigned to DRG 388 and a full-term newborn with one of these
codes would be assigned to DRG 390.

 


The following diagnosis codes would be removed from the major problems list in DRGs 387 and 389 and would not be added
to the significant problems list: 




774.30_Neonatal jaundice due to delayed conjugation, cause unspecified 

774.31_Neonatal jaundice due to delayed conjugation in diseases classified elsewhere 

774.39_Other neonatal jaundice due to delayed conjugation from other causes 

774.5_Perinatal jaundice from other causes




Therefore, a premature newborn with one of these conditions would be assigned to DRG 388 and a full-term newborn with
one of these conditions would be assigned to DRG 391. 



The following diagnosis codes would remain on the major problems list and continue to result in assignment to DRGs
387 and 389:

 


774.4_Perinatal jaundice due to hepatocellular damage 

774.7_Kernicterus not due to isoimmunization




Finally, diagnosis codes 774.6 (Unspecified fetal and neonatal jaundice) would continue to be considered a nonsignificant
condition and result in assignment to DRGs 388 and 391. 

We note again that these proposals are based only on clinical considerations and respond to specific requests made
by the public. We will continue our work on a more comprehensive evaluation of the MDC 15 DRGs and will announce our proposal
when that evaluation is completed. 



4. Surgical Hierarchies 



Some inpatient stays entail multiple surgical procedures, each one of which, occurring by itself, could result in
assignment of the case to a different DRG within the MDC to which the principal diagnosis is assigned. It is, therefore,
necessary to have a decision rule by which these cases are assigned to a single DRG. The surgical hierarchy, an ordering
of surgical classes from most to least resource intensive, performs that function. Its application ensures that
cases involving multiple surgical procedures are assigned to the DRG associated with the most resource-intensive
surgical class. 

Because the relative resource intensity of surgical classes can shift as a function of DRG reclassification and recalibration,
we reviewed the surgical hierarchy of each MDC, as we have for previous reclassifications, to determine if the ordering
of classes coincided with the intensity of resource utilization, as measured by the same billing data used to compute
the DRG relative weights. 

A surgical class can be composed of one or more DRGs. For example, in MDC 5, the surgical class ``heart transplant''
consists of a single DRG (DRG 103) and the class ``coronary bypass'' consists of two DRGs (DRGs 106 and 107). Consequently,
in many cases, the surgical hierarchy has an impact on more than one DRG. The methodology for determining the most resource-intensive
surgical class, therefore, involves weighting each DRG for frequency to determine the average resources for each
surgical class. For example, assume surgical class A includes DRGs 1 and 2 and surgical class B includes DRGs 3, 4, and
5, and that the average charge of DRG 1 is higher than that of DRG 3, but the average charges of DRGs 4 and 5 are higher than
the average charge of DRG 2. To determine whether surgical class A should be higher or lower than surgical class B in
the surgical hierarchy, we would weight the average charge of each DRG by frequency (that is, by the number of cases
in the DRG) to determine average resource consumption for the surgical class. The surgical classes would then be ordered
from the class with the highest average resource utilization to that with the lowest, with the exception of ``other
OR procedures'' as discussed below. 

This methodology may occasionally result in a case involving multiple procedures being assigned to the lower-weighted
DRG (in the highest, most resource-intensive surgical class) of the available alternatives. However, given that
the logic underlying the surgical hierarchy provides that the GROUPER searches for the procedure in the most resource-intensive
surgical class, which may sometimes occur in cases involving multiple procedures, this result is unavoidable. 

We note that, notwithstanding the foregoing discussion, there are a few instances when a surgical class with a lower
average relative weight is ordered above a surgical class with a higher average relative weight. For example, the
``other OR procedures'' surgical class is uniformly ordered last in the surgical hierarchy of each MDC in which it
occurs, regardless of the fact that the relative weight for the DRG or DRGs in that surgical class may be higher than
that for other surgical classes in the MDC. The ``other OR procedures'' class is a group of procedures that are least
likely to be related to the diagnoses in the MDC but are occasionally performed on patients with these diagnoses. Therefore,
these procedures should only be considered if no other procedure more closely related to the diagnoses in the MDC has
been performed.

<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A second example occurs when the difference between the average weights for two surgical classes is very small. We
have found that small differences generally do not warrant reordering of the hierarchy since, by virtue of the 
hierarchy change, the relative weights are likely to shift such that the higher-ordered surgical class has a lower
average weight than the class ordered below it. 

Based on the preliminary recalibration of the DRGs, we are proposing to modify the surgical hierarchy as set forth
below. As we stated in the September 1, 1989 final rule (54 FR 36457), we are unable to test the effects of the proposed
revisions to the surgical hierarchy and to reflect these changes in the proposed relative weights due to the unavailability
of revised GROUPER software at the time this proposed rule is prepared. Rather, we simulate most major classification
changes to approximate the placement of cases under the proposed reclassification and then determine the average
charge for each DRG. These average charges then serve as our best estimate of relative resource use for each surgical
class. We test the proposed surgical hierarchy changes after the revised GROUPER is received and reflect the final
changes in the DRG relative weights in the final rule. Further, as discussed below in section II.C of this preamble,
we anticipate that the final recalibrated weights will be somewhat different from those proposed, since they will
be based on more complete data. Consequently, further revision of the hierarchy, using the above principles, may
be necessary in the final rule.

At this time, we would revise the surgical hierarchy for MDC 2 (Diseases and Disorders of the Eye) and MDC 3 (Diseases
and Disorders of the Ear, Nose, Mouth and Throat).

 In MDC 2, we would reorder Extraocular Procedures Except Orbit (DRGs 40 and 41) above Intraocular Procedures
Except Retina, Iris and Lens (DRG 42).

 In MDC 3, we would reorder Rhinoplasty (DRG 56) above Salivary Gland Procedures Except Sialoadenectomy (DRG
51).



5. Refinement of Complications and Comorbidities List



There is a standard list of diagnoses that are considered complications or comorbidities (CCs). We developed this
list using physician panels to include those diagnoses that, when present as a secondary condition, would be considered
a substantial complication or comorbidity. In preparing the original CC list, a substantial CC was defined as a condition
that, because of its presence with a specific principal diagnosis, would increase the length of stay by at least 1 day
for at least 75 percent of the patients.

In previous years, we have made changes to the standard list of CCs, either by adding new CCs or deleting CCs already
on the list. For FY 1995, we are not proposing to make any changes to the current CC list. 

In the September 1, 1987 final notice concerning changes to the DRG classification system (52 FR 33143), we modified
the GROUPER logic so that certain diagnoses included on the standard list of CCs would not be considered a valid CC in
combination with a particular principal diagnosis. Thus, we created the CC Exclusions List. We made these changes
to preclude coding of CCs for closely related conditions, to preclude duplicative coding or inconsistent coding
from being treated as CCs, and to ensure that cases are appropriately classified between the complicated and uncomplicated
DRGs in a pair.

In the May 19, 1987 proposed notice concerning changes to the DRG classification system (52 FR 18877), we explained
that the excluded secondary diagnoses were established using the following five principles:

 Chronic and acute manifestations of the same condition should not be considered CCs for one another (as subsequently
corrected in the September 1, 1987 final notice (52 FR 33154)).

 Specific and nonspecific (that is, not otherwise specified (NOS)) diagnosis codes for a condition should
not be considered CCs for one another.

<TEXT>
 

 Conditions that may not co-exist, such as partial/total, unilateral/bilateral, obstructed/unobstructed,
and benign/malignant, should not be considered CCs for one another. 

 The same condition in anatomically proximal sites should not be considered CCs for one another. 

 Closely related conditions should not be considered CCs for one another. 

The creation of the CC Exclusions List was a major project involving hundreds of codes. The FY 1988 revisions were intended
to be only a first step toward refinement of the CC list in that the criteria used for eliminating 
certain diagnoses from consideration as CCs were intended to identify only the most obvious diagnoses that should
not be considered complications or comorbidities of another diagnosis. For that reason, and in light of comments
and questions on the CC list, we have continued to review the remaining CCs to identify additional exclusions and to
remove diagnoses from the master list that have been shown not to meet the definition of a CC stated above, as 
appropriate. (See the September 30, 1988 final rule for the revision made for the discharges occurring in FY 1989 (53
FR 38485), the September 1, 1989 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1990 (54 FR 36552),
the September 4, 1990 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1991 (55 FR 36126), the August
30, 1991 final rule for the revision made for discharges occurring in FY 1992 (56 FR 43209), the September 1, 1992 final
rule for the revisions made for discharges occurring in FY 1993 (57 FR 39753), and the September 1, 1993 final rule for
the revisions made for 
discharges occurring in FY 1994 (58 FR 46278).) 

We are proposing a limited revision of the CC Exclusions List to take into account the changes that will be made in the
ICD-9-CM diagnosis coding system effective October 1, 1994. (See section II.B.7, below, for a discussion
of these changes.) These proposed changes are being made in accordance with the principles established when we created
the CC Exclusions List in 1987. 

In addition, upon review of our current CC Exclusions List, we found that there are some diagnosis codes that do not
exclude themselves as CCs. In the September 1, 1987 final notice, we noted that a very few codes were not 
excluded from themselves because they may signify the bilateral occurrence of a particular condition (for example,
diagnosis code 730.02 (acute osteomyelitis of upper arm)) (52 FR 33154). However, we found some diagnosis codes that
do not meet this criterion. Therefore, we are proposing to add the following diagnosis codes to the CC Exclusions List
as excluding themselves when they are secondary diagnoses: 




710.0_Systemic lupus erythematous 
710.1_Systemic sclerosis 
710.3_Sicca syndrome 
710.4_Dermatomyositis 
710.8_Other specified diffuse diseases of connective tissue 




Based on a comment we received, we are also proposing to exclude diagnosis code 707.1 (Ulcer of lower limb, except decubitus)
as a CC when the principal diagnosis is 440.23 (atherosclerosis of the extremities with ulceration). The 
commenter believes that this exclusion is similar to the current exclusion of 785.4 (Gangrene) when the principal
diagnosis is 440.24 (Atherosclerosis of the extremities with gangrene), and we agree with the commenter's assessment.


Finally, it was brought to our attention by another commenter that when a patient's principal diagnosis is complication
of a transplant condition (diagnosis codes 996.71 and 996.8x), the diagnosis codes used to denote transplant status
(V42.x) should not be considered CCs. Thus, for the following principal diagnoses, we are proposing to delete the
indicated status code: 

 For code 996.71 (Complications due to heart valve prosthesis) delete code V42.2 (Heart valve transplant influencing
health status) as a CC. 

 For code 996.80 (Complications of unspecified organ transplant) delete codes V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing
health status), V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health status), V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health
status), V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health status), and V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue transplant
influencing health status) 
as CCs. 

 For code 996.81 (Complications of kidney transplant) delete code V42.0 (Kidney transplant influencing health
status) as a CC. 

 For code 996.82 (Complications of liver transplant) delete code V42.7 (Liver transplant influencing health
status) 

 For code 996.83 (Complications of heart transplant) delete code V42.1 (Heart transplant influencing health
status) as a CC. 

 For code 996.84 (Complications of lung transplant) delete code V42.6 (Lung transplant influencing health
status) as a CC.

 For code 996.86 (Complications of pancreas transplant) delete code V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue
transplant influencing health status) as a CC. 

 For code 996.89 (Complications of other specified organ transplant) V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue
transplant influencing health status) as a CC. 

All of the changes discussed above have been added to Table 6f, Additions to the CC Exclusions List, in section V of the
addendum to this proposed rule. 

Tables 6f and 6g in section V of the addendum to this proposed rule contain the proposed revisions to the CC Exclusions
List that would be effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. Each table shows the principal diagnoses
with proposed changes to the excluded CCs. Each of these principal diagnoses is shown with an asterisk and the additions
or deletions to the CC Exclusions List are provided in an indented column immediately following the affected principal
diagnosis. 

CCs that are added to the list are in Table 6f_Additions to the CC Exclusions List. Beginning with discharges on or after
October 1, 1994, the indented diagnoses will not be recognized by the GROUPER as valid CCs for the asterisked principal
diagnosis. 

CCs that are deleted from the list are in Table 6g_Deletions from the CC Exclusions List. Beginning with discharges
on or after October 1, 1994, the indented diagnoses will be recognized by the GROUPER as valid CCs for the asterisked
principal diagnosis. 

Copies of the original CC Exclusions List applicable to FY 1988 can be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) of the Department of Commerce. It is available in hard copy for $84.00 and on microfiche for $20.50,
plus $3.00 for shipping and handling. A request for the FY 1988 CC Exclusions List (which should include the identification
accession number, (PB) 88-133970) should be made to the following address: National Technical Information
Service; United States Department of Commerce; 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161; or by calling
(703) 487-4650. 

Users should be aware of the fact that all revisions to the CC Exclusions List (FYs 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and
1994) and those in Tables 6f and 6g of this document must be incorporated into the list purchased from NTIS in 
order to obtain the CC Exclusions List applicable for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994.

6. Review of Procedure Codes in DRGs 468, 476, and 477 



Each year, we review cases assigned to DRG 468 (Extensive OR Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), DRG 476
(Prostatic OR procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), and DRG 477 (Nonextensive OR Procedure Unrelated 
to Principal Diagnosis) in order to determine whether procedures are properly assigned among these DRGs. 

DRGs 468, 476, and 477 are reserved for those cases in which none of the OR procedures performed is related to the principal
diagnosis. These DRGs are intended to capture atypical cases, that is, those cases not occurring with 
sufficient frequency to represent a distinct, recognizable clinical group. DRG 476 is assigned to those discharges
in which one or more of the following prostatic procedures are performed and are unrelated to the principal diagnosis:

 


60.0_Incision of prostate 
60.12_Open biopsy of prostate 
60.15_Biopsy of periprostatic tissue 
60.18_Other diagnostic procedures on prostate and periprostatic tissue 
60.2_Transurethral prostatectomy 
60.61_Local excision of lesion of prostate 
60.69_Prostatectomy NEC 
60.81_Incision of periprostatic tissue 
60.82_Excision of periprostatic tissue 
60.93_Repair of prostate 
60.94_Control of (postoperative) hemorrhage of prostate 
60.95_Transurethral balloon dilation of the prostratic urethra 
60.99_Other operations on prostate 



All remaining OR procedures are assigned to DRGs 468 and 477, with DRG 477 assigned to those discharges in which the
only procedures performed are nonextensive procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis. The original
list of the ICD-9-CM procedure codes for the procedures we consider nonextensive procedures if performed
with an unrelated principal diagnosis was published in Table 6C in section IV of the addendum to the September 30, 1988
final rule (53 FR 38591). As part of the final rules published on September 4, 1990, August 30, 1991, September 1, 1992,
and September 1, 1993, we moved several other procedures from DRG 468 to 477. (See 55 FR 36135, 56 FR 43212, 57 FR 23625,
and 58 FR 46279, respectively.) 



a. Adding Procedure Codes to MDCs.

 We annually conduct a review of procedures producing DRG 468 or 477 assignments on the basis of volume of cases in these
DRGs with each procedure. Our medical consultants then identify those procedures occurring in conjunction with
certain principal diagnoses with sufficient frequency to justify adding them to one of the surgical DRGs for the MDC
in which the diagnosis falls. On the basis of this review, 
we are proposing the following DRG classification changes in order to reduce unnecessary assignment of cases to DRG
468 or 477.

 MDC 1 (Diseases and Disorders of the Nervous System) 

We have observed that surgical pacemaker procedures are being performed with increasing frequency for anatomical
nerve problems associated with heart block. These diagnoses, diagnosis codes 337.0 (Idiopathic peripheral autonomic
neuropathy), 742.8 (Other specified anomalies of nervous system), and 742.9 (Unspecified anomaly of brain, spinal
cord, and nervous system), are assigned to MDC 1, but the surgical pacemaker procedures are not. Consequently, when
a pacemaker procedure is performed on a patient with one of these diagnoses, the case is assigned to DRG 468. Therefore,
we propose to add the following procedure codes to DRGs 7 and 8 (Peripheral and Cranial Nerve and Other Nervous System
Procedures): 




37.74_Insertion or replacement of epicardial lead (electrode) into epicardium 
37.75_Revision of lead (electrode) 
37.76_Replacement of transvenous atrial and/or ventricular lead(s) (electrode) 
37.77_Removal of lead(s) (electrode) without replacement 
37.79_Revision or relocation of pacemaker pocket 
37.80_Insertion of permanent pacemaker, initial or replacement, type of device not specified 
37.85_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with single-chamber device, not specified as rate responsive 
37.86_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with single-chamber device, rate responsive 
37.87_Replacement of any type pacemaker device with dual-chamber device 
37.89_Revision or removal of pacemaker device 




In addition, during our review of DRG 468 cases, we found that there are several hundred cases of lower limb amputation
procedures with a principal diagnosis from MDC 1. Patients with diabetes often develop complications that 
require the performance of a lower limb amputation. Although the majority of the diagnosis codes for diabetes are
assigned to MDC 10 (Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases and Disorders), cases with a principal diagnosis
of diabetes with neurological manifestations (diagnosis codes 250.60, 250.61, 250.62 and 250.63) are assigned
to MDC 1. Therefore, we are proposing to move the following procedures to DRGs 7 and 8:

 


84.11_Amputation of toe 
84.12_Amputation through foot 
84.13_Disarticulation of ankle 
84.14_Amputation of ankle through malleoli of tibia and fibula 
84.15_Other amputation below knee 
84.16_Disarticulation of knee 
84.17_Amputation above knee 



 MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the Circulatory System) 

Closed endoscopic biopsy of lung (procedure code 33.27) and open biopsy of lung (procedure code 33.28), diagnostic
tools for vascular tumors, are often performed on patients with a principal diagnosis of 228.00 (Hemangioma of 
unspecified site) or 228.09 (Hemangioma of other sites). Although these principal diagnoses are assigned to MDC
5, the diagnostic procedures are not. Thus, if they are included together on the same claim, the case will be 
assigned to DRG 468. Therefore, we are proposing to assign procedure codes 33.27 and 33.28 to DRG 120 (Other Circulatory
System OR Procedures) in MDC 5. 

In addition, we identified the following nonextensive OR procedures (that is, procedures assigned to DRG 477) as
appropriate to move to MDC 5: 




40.11_Biopsy of lymph structure 
40.19_Other diagnostic procedures on lymphatic structures 
40.21_Excision of deep cervical lymph node 
40.23_Excision of axillary lymph node 
40.24_Excision of inguinal lymph node 
40.29_Simple excision of other lymphatic structure 
40.3_Regional lymph node excision

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These procedures are commonly performed with a variety of diagnoses found in MDC 5 such as disorders of the peripheral
vascular system (diagnosis codes 747.60 and 747.69) and peripheral angiopathy (diagnosis code 443.81), as well
as a number of heart conditions including malignant neoplasm of the heart (diagnosis code 164.1), and coxsackie carditis,
coxsackie pericarditis, coxsackie endocarditis, and coxsackie myocarditis (diagnosis codes 074.20, 074.21,
074.22, 074.23, respectively). We note that these commonly performed diagnostic procedures are assigned to virtually
every other MDC because they are associated with many diagnoses. Therefore, we propose to move these procedures to
DRG 120. 



We also note that hemangioma and anomalies of the peripheral vascular system may require open rectal biopsy (procedure
code 48.25) or excision of the rectal lesion (procedure code 48.35) as part of their treatment. At the present time,
neither of these procedure codes classify to MDC 5. Thus, we are proposing to move procedure codes 48.25 and 48.35 to
DRG 120. 

 MDC 6 (Diseases and Disorders of the Digestive System) 

A total splenectomy (procedure code 41.5) may be performed on patients with a principal diagnosis of secondary malignant
neoplasm of other digestive organs and spleen (diagnosis code 197.8). This diagnosis is included in MDC 6, but the
procedure is not, resulting in the assignment of cases to DRG 468. Thus, we propose to add procedure code 41.5 to DRG
170 and 171 (Other Digestive System OR Procedures) in MDC 6. 



b. Reassignment of Procedures Among DRGs 468, 476, and 477.

 We also reviewed the list of procedures that produce assignments to each of DRG 468, 476, and 477 to ascertain if any
of those procedures should be moved to one of the other DRGs based on average charges and length of stay. Generally,
we move only those procedures for which we have an adequate number of discharges to analyze the data. Based on our review
this year, we are proposing to move a limited number of procedures. 

In reviewing the list of OR procedures that produce DRG 468 assignments, we analyzed the average charge and length
of stay data for cases assigned to that DRG to identify those procedures that are more similar to the discharges that
currently group to either DRG 476 or 477. We identified three procedures that are significantly less resource intensive
than the other procedures assigned to DRG 468. Therefore, we are proposing to move the following procedures to the
list of procedures that result in assignment to DRG 477: 





24.5_Alveoloplasty 

53.61_Incisional hernia repair with prosthesis 

53.69_Repair of other hernia of anterior abdominal wall with prosthesis





We conducted a similar analysis of the procedures that assign cases to DRG 477 to determine if any of those procedures
might more appropriately be classified to DRG 468. Again, we analyzed charge and length of stay data to identify procedures
that were more similar to discharges assigned to DRG 468 than to those classified in DRG 477. We did not identify any
procedures in DRG 477 that should be assigned to DRG 468. 

All of the proposed reassignments of procedures in DRGs 468 and 477 would be effective with discharges beginning on
or after October 1, 1994. 



7. Changes to the ICD-9-CM Coding System 



As discussed above in section II.B.1. of this preamble, the ICD-9-CM is a coding system that is used for
the reporting of diagnoses and procedures performed on a patient. In September 1985, the ICD-9-CM Coordination
and Maintenance Committee was formed. This is a Federal interdepartmental committee charged with the mission of
maintaining and updating the ICD-9-CM. That mission includes approving coding changes, and developing
errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD-9-CM to reflect newly developed procedures and technologies
and newly identified diseases. The Committee is also responsible for promoting the use of Federal and non-Federal
educational programs and other communication techniques with a view toward standardizing coding applications
and upgrading the quality of the classification system. 

The Committee is co-chaired by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and HCFA. The NCHS has lead responsibility
for the ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes included in Volume 1_Diseases: Tabular List and Volume 2_Diseases:
Alphabetic Index, while HCFA has lead responsibility for the ICD-9-CM procedure codes included in Volume
3_Procedures: Tabular List and Alphabetic Index. 

The Committee encourages participation in the above process by health-related organizations. In this regard, the
Committee holds public meetings for discussion of educational issues and proposed coding changes. These meetings
provide an opportunity for representatives of recognized organizations in the coding fields, such as the American
Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) (formerly American Medical Record Association (AMRA)), the
American Hospital Association (AHA), and various physician specialty groups as well as physicians, medical record
administrators, health information management professionals, and other members of the public to contribute ideas
on coding matters. After considering the opinions expressed at the public meetings and in writing, the Committee
formulates recommendations, which then must be approved by the agencies. 

The Committee presented proposals for coding changes at public meetings held on May 6, August 5, and December 2, 1993,
and finalized the coding changes after consideration of comments received at the meetings and in writing within 30
days following the December 1993 meeting. The initial meeting for consideration of coding issues for implementation
in FY 1996 will be held on May 5, 1994. Copies of the minutes of these meetings may be obtained by writing to one of the co-chairpersons
representing NCHS and HCFA. We encourage commenters to address suggestions on coding issues involving diagnosis
codes to: Sue Meads, Co-Chairperson; ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee; NCHS; Rm. 9-58;
6525 Belcrest Road; Hyattsville, Maryland 20782.

Questions and comments concerning the procedure codes 
should be addressed to: Patricia E. Brooks, Co-Chairperson; 
ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee; HCFA, 
Office of Coverage and Eligibility Policy; Rm. 401 East High 
Rise Building; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland 
21207. 
The ICD-9-CM code changes that have been approved will 
become effective October 1, 1994. The new ICD-9-CM codes 
are listed, along with their proposed DRG classifications, 
in Tables 6a and 6b (New Diagnosis Codes and New Procedure 
Codes, respectively) in section IV of the addendum to this 
proposed rule. As we stated above, the code numbers and 
their titles were presented for public comment in the 
ICD-9-CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee meetings. 
Both oral and written comments were considered before the 
codes were approved. Therefore, we are soliciting comments 
only on the proposed DRG classification. 
Further, the Committee has approved the expansion of 
certain ICD-9-CM codes to require an additional digit for 
valid code assignment. Diagnosis codes that have been 
replaced by expanded codes, other codes, or have been 
deleted are in Table 6c (Invalid Diagnosis Codes). The 
invalid diagnosis codes will not be recognized by the 
GROUPER beginning with discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 1994. The corresponding new or expanded codes 
are included in Tables 6a and 6b. The committee did not 
delete any procedure codes effective for October 1, 1994. 
Revisions to diagnosis and procedure code titles are in 
Tables 6d (Revised Diagnosis Code Titles) and 6e (Revised 
Procedure Code Titles), which also include the proposed DRG 
assignments for these revised codes. 


8. DRG Refinements 


For several years, we have been analyzing major 
refinements to the DRG classification system to compensate 
hospitals more equitably for treating severely ill Medicare 
patients. These refinements, generally referred to as 
severity of illness adjustments, would create DRGs 
specifically for hospital discharges involving very ill 
patients who consume far more resources than do other 
patients classified to the same DRGs in the current system. 
This approach has been taken by various other groups in 
refining the DRG system, most notably the research done for 
Yale, the changes incorporated by the State of New York into 
its all patient (AP) DRG system, and the all-patient refined 
(APR) DRGs, which are a joint effort of 3M/HIS and the 
National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related 
Institutions. 
Our preliminary work on these refinements is finished, 
and we have prepared a paper available to the public for 
comment that describes our proposed severity DRG 
classification system as well as the analysis upon which our 
proposal was formulated. Briefly, our approach was to 
develop a list of secondary diagnoses that have a major 
effect on the resources used by hospitals in treating 
patients across DRGs and to evaluate the need to create DRGs 
for major CCs on a DRG-by-DRG basis. The following is a 
description of our methodology: 
 Our first step, similar to the process used by Yale, 
was to collapse the current paired DRG groupings (DRGs with 
and without CCs). We also evaluated the current DRGs to 
determine if any of them could be combined. Based on this 
analysis, we eliminated 24 DRGs. 
 Our next step was to evaluate individual diagnosis 
codes to determine if the presence of the diagnosis as a 
secondary condition resulted in increased resource use for 
hospitals across all DRGs. We analyzed how the presence of 
the secondary diagnosis affected resource use compared to 
other secondary diagnoses that have been classified as non-CC, CC, or major CC. 
 Although our final decisions of the CC designation of a 
secondary diagnosis were primarily data driven, we did make 
some designations based on other factors. Specifically, 
regardless of the data, we did not designate a diagnosis as 
major if it is indicative of poor quality of care or is 
prone to hospital upcoding.

<TEXT>
 

 After finalizing the classification of secondary 
diagnoses, we evaluated which collapsed DRGs should be split 
on the basis of the presence of a major CC, other CCs, or 
both. We developed criteria for this evaluation that allow 
a DRG to split only if the volume and difference in resource 
use is significantly different from the remainder of the 
cases in the DRG and there is a significant reduction in 
variance. The collapsed DRGs can be split into three 
variations: 



_DRG With CC or Major CC 
_DRG Without CC 
_DRG With Major CC 
_DRG Without Major CC 
_DRG With Major CC 
_DRG With CC 
_DRG Without CC 



There are 120 DRGs that do not split at all. This final 
step resulted in the creation of 652 DRGs compared to the 
491 DRGs we currently use. 


The paper we have prepared includes a listing of the 
revised DRGs as well as the relative weights that would have 
been assigned to the DRGs using the FY 1992 MedPAR data and 
a list of every diagnosis code in effect in FY 1993 with its 
current and proposed CC assignment (non-CC, CC, or major 
CC). In order to begin consultation with the hospital 
industry and other interested organizations before formally 
proposing our revised system, we will be distributing the 
paper to many hospital-related associations and 
organizations for their comment. In addition, requests for 
the DRG severity refinement paper may be made to the 
following address: Division of Hospital Payment Policy, 1-H-1 East Low Rise, 6325 Security Boulevard,
Baltimore, 
Maryland 21207, Attn: Nancy Edwards; or by calling (410) 
966-4532. Comments are due to HCFA by September 30, 1994. 
Similar to our usual practice for proposed DRG changes 
to the prospective payment system, we are making available 
to the public an FY 1992 Expanded Modified MedPAR File for 
Severity that contains the discharge records we used to 
calculate the severity DRG relative weights. Requests for 
this file can be made by following the instructions set 
forth in section VIII.B of this preamble (Requests for Data 
from the Public). Also available are Severity versions of 
the HCFA Medicare Case-Mix Index File, Table 5 DRG, and the 
AOR/BOR File. 
Our plan is to incorporate comments and suggestions we 
receive and to consider proposing the complete revised DRG 
system as part of the FY 1996 prospective payment system 
proposed rule, which will be published in the spring of 
1995. However, as the final rule published on September 1, 
1992 (57 FR 39761) indicates, we would not propose to make 
significant changes to the DRG classification system unless 
we are able either to improve our ability to predict coding 
changes by validating in advance the impact that potential 
DRG changes may have on coding behavior, or to make 
methodological changes to prevent building the inflationary 
effects of the coding changes into future program payments. 
Besides the mandate of section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of 
the Act, which provides that aggregate payments may not be 
affected by DRG reclassification and recalibration changes, 
we do not believe it is prudent policy to make changes for 
which we cannot predict the effect on the case-mix index 
and, thus, payments. Our goal is to refine our methodology 
so that we can fulfill, in the most appropriate manner, both 
the statutory requirement to make appropriate DRG 
classification changes and to recalibrate DRG relative 
weights (as mandated by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act) as 
well as to make DRG changes in a budget neutral manner. 
One approach to this problem would be to maintain the 
average case weight at 1.0 after recalibration, thereby 
eliminating the process of normalization. In other words, 
after recalibration, we would not scale the new relative 
weights upward to carry forward the cumulative effects of 
past case-mix increases. We would, instead, make an 
adjustment or include in the annual update factor a specific 
allowance for any real case-mix change that occurred during 
the previous year. This is a relatively simple and 
straightforward system for preventing the effects of year-to-year increase in the case-mix index from accumulating
in 
the DRG weights. 
In addition to the severity changes, we also intend to 
improve the classification and relative weights of the DRGs 
that apply to newborns, children, and maternity patients. 
The Medicare population does not include many of these 
individuals. The original DRG classification system was 
developed from analysis of claims data representative of the 
total inpatient population. When we calculated the original 
Medicare weights for the DRGs to which newborn, children and 
maternity patients are classified, we used non-MedPAR 
discharge records from Maryland and Michigan hospitals 
because there were either no MedPAR cases or too few cases 
assigned to these DRGs to provide a reasonably precise 
estimate of the average cost of care. (See the September 1, 
1983 prospective payment final rule with comment period 
(48 FR 39768).) Since that time, because of the lack of 
MedPAR data, these low-volume DRGs have not been analyzed 
and refined, and the relative weights assigned to them may 
no longer be entirely reflective of the resources needed to 
treat the patients. We again intend to rely on data bases 
outside the MedPAR file to supplement our data. 


C. Recalibration of DRG Weights 


We are proposing to use the same basic methodology for 
the FY 1995 recalibration as we did for FY 1994. (See the 
September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46290).) That is, we 
would recalibrate the weights based on charge data for 
Medicare discharges. However, we would use the most current 
charge information available, the FY 1993 MedPAR file, 
rather than the FY 1992 MedPAR file. The MedPAR file is 
based on fully-coded diagnostic and surgical procedure data 
for all Medicare inpatient hospital bills.

<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed recalibrated DRG relative weights are 
constructed from FY 1993 MedPAR data, received by HCFA 
through December 1993, from all hospitals subject to the 
prospective payment system and short-term acute care 
hospitals in waiver States. The FY 1993 MedPAR file 
includes data for approximately 10.5 million Medicare 
discharges. 
The methodology used to calculate the proposed DRG 
relative weights from the FY 1993 MedPAR file is as follows: 
 To the extent possible, all the claims were regrouped 
using the proposed DRG classification revisions discussed 
above in section II.B of this preamble. As noted in section 
II.B.4, due to the unavailability of revised GROUPER 
software, we simulate most major classification changes to 
approximate the placement of cases under the proposed 
reclassification. However, there are some changes that 
cannot be modeled. 
 Charges were standardized to remove the effects of 
differences in area wage levels, indirect medical education 
costs, disproportionate share payments, and, for hospitals 
in Alaska and Hawaii, the applicable cost-of-living 
adjustment. 
 The average standardized charge per DRG was calculated 
by summing the standardized charges for all cases in the DRG 
and dividing that amount by the number of cases classified 
in the DRG. 
 We then eliminated statistical outliers using the same 
criterion as was used in computing the current weights. 
That is, all cases outside of 3.0 standard deviations from 
the mean of the log distribution of charges per case for 
each DRG were eliminated. 
 The average charge for each DRG was then recomputed 
(excluding the statistical outliers) and divided by the 
national average standardized charge per case to determine 
the relative weight. 
 We established the relative weight for heart 
transplants (DRG 103) in a manner consistent with the 
methodology for all other DRGs except that the heart 
transplant cases that were used to establish the weight were 
limited to those Medicare-approved heart transplant centers 
that have cases in the FY 1993 MedPAR file. Similarly, we 
limited the liver transplant cases that were used to 
establish the weight for DRG 480 (Liver Transplant) to those 
hospitals that are Medicare-approved liver transplant 
centers. 
 Acquisition costs for kidney, heart, and liver 
transplants continue to be paid on a reasonable cost basis. 
Unlike other excluded costs, the acquisition costs are 
concentrated in specific DRGs (DRG 302 (Kidney Transplant); 
DRG 103 (Heart Transplant); and DRG 480 (Liver Transplant)). 
Because these costs are paid separately from the prospective 
payment rate, it is necessary to make an adjustment to 
prevent the relative weights for these DRGs from including 
the effect of the acquisition costs. Therefore, we 
subtracted the acquisition charges from the total charges on 
each transplant bill that showed acquisition charges before 
computing the average charge for the DRG and before 
eliminating statistical outliers. 
When we recalibrated the DRG weights for previous 
years, we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number 
of cases required to compute a reasonable weight. We 
propose to use that same case threshold in recalibrating the 
DRG weights for FY 1995. Using the FY 1993 MedPAR data set, 
there are 35 DRGs that contain fewer than 10 cases. We 
computed the weight for the 35 low-volume DRGs by adjusting 
the original weights of these DRGs by the percentage change 
in the average weight of the cases in the remaining DRGs. 
The weights developed according to the methodology 
described above, using the proposed DRG classification 
changes, result in an average case weight that is different 
from the average case weight before recalibration. 
Therefore, the new weights are normalized by an adjustment 
factor, so that the average case weight after recalibration 
is equal to the average case weight before recalibration. 
This adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration by 
itself neither increases nor decreases total payments under 
the prospective payment system. 
Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act requires that 
beginning with FY 1991, reclassification and recalibration 
changes be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate 
payments are neither greater than nor less than the 
aggregate payments that would have been made without the 
changes. Although normalization is intended to achieve this 
effect, equating the average case weight after recalibration 
to the average case weight before recalibration does not 
necessarily achieve budget neutrality with respect to 
aggregate payments to hospitals because payment to hospitals 
is affected by factors other than average case weight. 
Therefore, as discussed in section II.A.4.b. of the Addendum 
to this proposed rule, we are proposing to make a budget 
neutrality adjustment to assure the requirement of section 
1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act is met.

III. Proposed Changes to the Hospital Wage Index and 
Possible Refinements to Labor Market Areas 


A. Background 


Under the Medicare prospective payment system, 
different payment rates are calculated for hospitals located 
in rural, urban, and large urban areas. For purposes of the 
standardized payment amount, section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the 
Social Security Act requires that we use Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas (MSAs) as defined by the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) to determine whether hospitals 
are located in rural, urban or large urban areas (areas with 
a population over 1 million). However, section 
1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides for the elimination of 
separate urban and rural standardized payment amounts 
beginning in FY 1995. This change is discussed below in 
section IV.C. of this proposed rule. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that, as part 
of the methodology for determining prospective payments to 
hospitals, the Secretary shall adjust the standardized 
amounts ``for area differences in hospital wage levels by a 
factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the 
relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the 
hospital compared to the national average hospital wage 
level.'' In accordance with the broad discretion conferred 
by this provision, we currently define hospital labor market 
areas based on the definitions of MSAs issued by OMB. 
Additionally, as discussed below, we adjust the wage index 
to take into account the geographic reclassification of 
hospitals in accordance with sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 
1886(d)(10) of the Act. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also requires that the 
wage index be updated annually beginning October 1, 1993. 
This section further provides that the Secretary base the 
update on a survey of wages and wage-related costs of short-term acute care hospitals. The survey should measure,
to 
the extent feasible, the earnings and paid hours of 
employment by occupational category and must exclude data 
with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in 
furnishing skilled nursing services. 
For determining prospective payments to hospitals in 
FY 1994, the wage index is based on the data collected from 
the Medicare cost reports submitted by short-term acute care 
hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990 
(that is, cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1989 and before October 1, 1990). The current 
wage index includes wages and salaries paid by a hospital, 
home office salaries, fringe benefits, and certain contract 
labor costs and hours. The current computation for the wage 
index excludes salaries and wages associated with non-hospital type services, such as skilled nursing facility

services, home health agency services, or other subprovider 
components that are not subject to the prospective payment 
system. 
As discussed in detail below, we are proposing to use 
updated wage data to construct the wage index as required by 
section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act. The FY 1995 wage index 
would be based on data for hospital cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 
1991 (FY 1991). 


B. FY 1995 Wage Index Update 


We propose to base the FY 1995 wage index, effective 
for hospital discharges occurring on or after October 1, 
1994 and before October 1, 1995, upon the data collected 
from the Medicare cost report (Worksheet S-3, Part II) 
submitted by hospitals for cost reporting periods beginning 
in FY 1991. 
We propose to use all of the categories of data 
collected from Worksheet S-3, Part II. Therefore, the 
proposed FY 1995 wage index reflects the following: 
 Total short-term acute care hospital salaries and hours. 
 Home office costs and hours. 
 Fringe benefits associated with hospital and home 
office salaries. 
 Direct patient care related contract labor cost and 
hours. 
 The exclusion of salaries and hours for non-hospital 
type services such as skilled nursing facility services, 
home health services, or other sub-provider components that 
are not subject to the prospective payment system. 


1. Verification of Wage Data from the Medicare Cost Report 


The data for the proposed FY 1995 wage index was 
obtained from Worksheet S-3, Part II, of the HCFA-2552 
submitted by short-term acute care hospitals for cost 
reporting periods beginning during FY 1991. The wage data 
are reported electronically to HCFA through the Hospital 
Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). Because of 
substantial deficiencies in the initial data reported by 
hospitals on the cost report (including missing data items 
such as excluded hours and total paid hours), we initiated 
an intensive review of the wage data and made numerous edits 
to ensure quality and accuracy. Medicare intermediaries 
were instructed to transmit any revisions through HCRIS by 
early January 1994. 
We subjected the revised cost report data to several 
edit checks. Of the 5,294 providers in the data base, over 
1,400 providers had data elements that failed an edit; 53 of 
these involved mathematical errors and have been resolved.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The other edits involved data that appeared unusual and had 
to be verified by the intermediary. Only 74 providers had 
data elements that were unresolved as of March 14, 1994. 
Most of the unresolved data elements fall outside 
established edit parameters and require verification by the 
intermediary. None of the unresolved data elements failed 
critical edits (that is, edits indicating serious data 
errors that affect the wage index computation). 


The wage file used to construct the proposed wage index 
includes data obtained in late January 1994 from the HCRIS 
database and subsequent changes we received from 
intermediaries through March 14, 1994. We have instructed 
the intermediaries to complete their verification of 
questionable data elements and to transmit any changes to 
the wage data, via HCRIS, no later than June 15, 1994. We 
expect that all outstanding data elements will be resolved 
by that date and that we will be able to reflect the 
corrected data in the final rule. 
In the past, the hospital wage index data file was not 
available to the public until mid-May. However, to allow 
hospitals more time to evaluate the wage data used to 
construct the proposed hospital wage index, on March 16, 
1994, we made available to the public a diskette containing 
the raw hospital wage data that were used to construct the 
proposed FY 1995 wage index. We advised State and national 
hospital groups of the availability of the data. We also 
instructed all fiscal intermediaries to inform the 
prospective payment hospitals they service that we would not 
be sending out hospital-specific wage data as we had for the 
proposed FY 1994 wage index, but that we would make the FY 
1991 data available on a diskette. The fiscal 
intermediaries were instructed to advise hospitals of the 
availability of the data either through their representative 
hospital organizations or directly from HCFA using order 
forms provided to them. Additional details on the cost and 
ordering of this file will be found below in section 
VIII. B. of this proposed rule, Requests for Data from the 
Public. 
In addition, we note that Table 3c in the Addendum to 
this proposed rule contains each hospital's inflated average 
hourly wage used to construct the wage index values. By 
backing out the applicable inflation factors (set forth 
below in section III.B.3.), a hospital can determine its 
uninflated average hourly wage as reflected in the proposed 
wage index. This table will also be included in the final 
rule. If a hospital believes, based on its review of the 
data contained in Table 3c, that its average hourly wage is 
inconsistent with the data submitted on Worksheet S-3, the 
hospital should contact its intermediary. 


2. Requests for Wage Data Corrections 


As noted above we will use cost report data from FY 
1991 (that is, cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 1991) for the update 
to the wage index. As such, we believe hospitals have had 
ample time to ensure the accuracy of their FY 1991 wage 
data. Moreover, the ultimate responsibility for accurately 
completing the cost report rests with the hospital, which 
must attest to the accuracy of the data at the time the cost 
report is filed. However, if a hospital believes that its 
FY 1991 wage data have been incorrectly reported, the 
hospital must submit corrections along with complete 
supporting documentation to its intermediary in time to 
allow for review, verification and transmission of the data 
before the development of the final wage index. To allow 
sufficient time to process any changes, a hospital must 
submit requests for corrections to its fiscal intermediary 
by May 15, 1994. The request should include all 
documentation necessary to support the requested change. To 
be reflected in the final wage index, any wage data 
corrections must be reviewed by the intermediary and 
transmitted to HCFA via HCRIS on or before June 15, 1994.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00043 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This deadline is necessary to allow sufficient time to download and edit the data so that the final wage index calculation
can be completed for development of the final prospective payment rates to be published by September 1, 1994. We cannot
guarantee that corrections transmitted to HCFA after June 15, 1994, will be reflected in the final wage index. Therefore,
we suggest that hospitals wishing to submit corrected data do so as soon as possible and follow up with their intermediaries
to ensure inclusion of the 
corrected data in the final FY 1995 wage index. 

After reviewing requested changes submitted by hospitals, intermediaries will transmit any revised cost reports
to HCRIS and will forward to the hospitals a copy of the revised Worksheet S-3, Part II. If requested changes are
not accepted, fiscal intermediaries will notify hospitals in writing of reasons why the changes were not accepted.
This procedure will ensure that hospitals have an opportunity to verify the data that will be used to construct their
wage index values. We believe that fiscal intermediaries are in the best position to make evaluations regarding the
appropriateness of a particular cost and whether it should be included in the wage index data. 
However, in the event that a hospital disagrees with the intermediary's resolution of a requested change, the hospital
may contact HCFA to attempt to resolve the dispute. 

We have created the above-described process to resolve all substantive wage data correction disputes before we finalize
the raw wage data for the FY 1995 payment rates, Accordingly, hospitals that do not meet the procedural 
deadlines described above will not be afforded a later opportunity to submit wage corrections or to dispute the intermediary's
decision with respect to requested changes. We note that we intend to make a diskette available in mid-August that
will contain the finalized raw wage data that will be used to construct the wage index values in the final rule. As with
the diskette made available in March 1994, HCFA will make the August diskette available to hospital associations
and the public. This August diskette, however, is being made available only for the limited purpose of identifying
any potential errors made by HCFA or the intermediary in the entry of the finalized wage data, not for the initiation
of new wage data correction requests. Hospitals are encouraged to review their hospital wage data promptly after
the release of the second diskette. 

If after reviewing the August diskette, a hospital believes that its wage data is incorrect due to a fiscal intermediary
or HCFA error, it should send a letter to both its fiscal intermediary and HCFA. The letters to the 
intermediary and HCFA should outline why the hospital believes an error exists. These requests must be 

received

 by HCFA no later than September 23. Requests should be sent to: Charles R. Booth, Director; Office of Payment Policy;
181 East High Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland 21207. The intermediary will review requests upon
receipt and, if it is determined that an intermediary or HCFA error exists, the fiscal intermediary will notify HCFA
immediately. 

As indicated above, after mid-August, we will make changes to the hospital wage data only in those very limited situations
involving an error by the intermediary or HCFA that the hospital could not have known about before its 
review of the August diskette. Specifically, neither the intermediary nor HCFA will accept the following types of
requests in conjunction with this mid-August process: requests for wage data correction that were submitted too

late to be included in the data transmitted to the HCRIS system on or before June 15, 1994, requests for correction of
errors made by the hospital not identified during the hospital's review of the March 1994 data, or requests to 
revisit factual determinations or policy interpretations made by the intermediary or HCFA during the wage data correction
process. Verified corrections to the wage index made as a result of an intermediary or HCFA error received timely (that
is, by September 23, 1994) will be effective 
October 1, 1994. 

We continue to believe, as outlined in the final rule published September 1, 1992 (57 FR 39765), that midyear corrections
should not be made in most cases. We believe the wage data correction process described above provides 
hospitals with sufficient opportunity to bring errors made during the preparation of Worksheet S-3 to the intermediary's
attention. Moreover, because hospitals will have access to the raw wage data in mid-August, they will have the opportunity
to detect any ministerial data tabulation errors made by the intermediary or HCFA before the implementation of the
prospective payment rates on October 1. We believe that if hospitals avail themselves of this opportunity, the wage
index implemented on October 1 should be free of such errors. Nevertheless, in the unlikely event that such errors
should occur, we do not believe a hospital should be disadvantaged because actions 
taken by its intermediary or HCFA in the tabulation of its data resulted in an error of which the hospital could not have
been aware. Since the current regulations do not provide for midyear corrections in these situations, we are 
proposing to revise the regulations to specify that the Secretary retains the right to make midyear changes to the
wage index under very limited circumstances. Again, we believe that it is appropriate to reserve the right to make
midyear changes to the wage index in those limited circumstances where the hospital can show that an error was made,
and the hospital could not have known about, or sought to correct, the error by September 23, 1994.

<TEXT>
 

Specifically, we propose to revise  412.63(s)(2) to provide that the Secretary may make midyear corrections
to the wage index only in those limited circumstances where a hospital can show: (1) That the intermediary or HCFA made
an error in tabulating its data, and (2) that the hospital could not have known about the error, or did not have an opportunity
to correct the error, by September 23, 1994. As indicated earlier, since a hospital will have the 
opportunity to verify its data and the intermediary will notify the hospital of any changes, we do not foresee any specific
circumstances under which midyear corrections would be made. However, should a midyear correction be necessary,
the wage index change for the affected area will be made prospectively from the date the correction is made. If midyear
corrections are made, we will evaluate their impact to determine if a budget neutrality adjustment to the program
payments should be made at the beginning of the 
following fiscal year in accordance with  412.63(s)(4). 



3. Computation of the Wage Index 



As noted above, we are proposing to base the FY 1995 wage index on wage data reported on the FY 1991 cost report. The wage
index would be based on data from 5,294 hospitals paid under the prospective payment system and short-term acute care
hospitals in waiver States. The method used to compute the proposed wage index is as follows: 

Step 1_We gathered data from each of the non-Federal short-term acute care hospitals for which data were reported
on the Worksheet S-3, Part II of the Medicare cost report for the hospital's cost reporting periods beginning
on or 
after October 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1991. Each hospital was assigned to its appropriate urban or rural area
prior to any reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8) or 1886(d)(10) of the Act. In addition, we included data
from a few hospitals that had cost reporting periods beginning in September 1990 and had reported a cost reporting
period exceeding 52 weeks. The data were included because no other data from these hospitals would be available for
the cost reporting period described above, and particular labor market areas might be affected due to the omission
of these hospitals. However, we generally describe this wage data as FY 1991 data. 

Step 2_For each hospital, we subtracted the excluded salaries (that is, direct salaries attributable to skilled
nursing facility services, home health services, and other sub-provider components not subject to the prospective

payment system) from gross hospital salaries to determine net hospital salaries. To the net hospital salaries, we
added hospital contract labor costs, hospital fringe benefits, and any home office salaries and fringe benefits
reported by the hospital to determine total salaries plus fringe benefits. 

Step 3_For each hospital, we inflated or deflated, as appropriate, the total salaries plus fringe benefits resulting
from Step 2 to a common period to determine total adjusted salaries. To make the wage inflation adjustment, 
we used the percentage change in average hourly earnings for each 30-day increment from October 14, 1990 through September
15, 1992, for hospital industry workers from S.I.C. 806, Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment and 
Earnings Bulletin. The annual inflation rates used were 5.6 percent for FY 1990 and FY 1991 and 4.8 percent for FY 1992.
The inflation factors used to inflate the hospital's data were based on the midpoint of the cost reporting period as
indicated below.

<TEXT>
 

For example, the midpoint of a cost reporting period beginning January 1, 1991 and ending December 31, 1991 is June
30, 1991. An inflation adjustment factor of 1.033713 would be applied to the wages of a hospital with such a cost reporting
period. In addition, for the data for any cost reporting period that began in FY 1991 and covers a period of less than
360 days or greater than 370 days, we annualized the data to reflect a 1-year cost report. 
Annualization is accomplished by dividing the data by the number of days in the cost report and then multiplying the
results by 365. 



Step 4_For each hospital, we subtracted the reported excluded hours from the gross hospital hours to determine net
hospital hours. We increased the net hours by the addition of any reported contract labor hours and home office hours
to determine total hours. 

Step 5_As part of our editing process, we deleted data for 69 hospitals that are no longer participating in the Medicare
program or that are in bankruptcy status, and for which we lacked sufficient documentation to verify data that failed
edits. We retained the data for other hospitals that are no longer participating in the Medicare program because these
hospitals contributed to the relative wage levels in their labor market areas during their FY 1991 cost reporting
period. 

Step 6_Within each urban or rural labor market area we added the total adjusted salaries plus fringe benefits obtained
in Step 3 for all hospitals in that area to determine the total adjusted salaries plus fringe benefits for the labor
market area. 

Step 7_We divided the total adjusted salaries plus fringe benefits obtained in Step 6 by the sum of the total hours (from
Step 4) for all hospitals in each labor market area to determine an average hourly wage for the area. 

Step 8_We added the total adjusted salaries plus fringe benefits obtained in Step 3 for all hospitals in the nation
and then divided the sum by the national sum of total hours from Step 4 to arrive at a national average hourly 
wage. Using the data as described above, the national average hourly wage is $18.1808. 

Step 9_For each urban or rural labor market area, we calculated the hospital wage index value by dividing the area average
hourly wage obtained in Step 7 by the national average hourly wage computed in Step 8. 



C. Changes In the Reporting of Hospital Wage Index Data 



Currently, the data used to develop the wage index are submitted by hospitals on the Worksheet S-3, Part II of
the Medicare cost report. We developed this worksheet as part of the FY 1990 cost reports, and we used the worksheet
to calculate the wage index for FY 1994. The worksheet has been evaluated by HCFA and industry representatives to ensure
that this data collection mechanism captures relative wage costs as accurately as possible and to determine whether
any refinements are appropriate. The Medicare 
Technical Advisory Group (MTAG) established a task force to study and recommend changes to the cost reporting form
used to collect wage index data. The task force was comprised of hospital, intermediary, and HCFA representatives.
The MTAG task force recommended, and we are proposing, three major changes to the Worksheet S-3, Part II; the
provider cost report questionnaire (HCFA 339); and accompanying instructions as discussed below. We note that the
proposed changes outlined below are effective for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994. Therefore the proposed changes will not affect the proposed FY 1995
wage index, which is based on FY 1991 wage data. 



1. The Elimination of Part A Physicians' and CRNA Salaries 



Currently, a hospital that directly employs and pays the salary of a physician can include the Part A portion of the
physician's salary in total salaries reported on Worksheet S-3, Part II. (The Part B portion of physician 
salaries has always been excluded from the wage index.) However, if a hospital contracts for physician services,
it is not permitted to include the Part A physician services as contract labor because we consider Part A physician
services to be administrative, not direct patient-care related (to be 
included in the computation of the wage index, contract labor must be directly related to patient care). 

Not all hospitals directly employ physicians. There are currently five States in which State laws specifically restrict
hospitals from directly hiring physicians. Hospitals in these States are forced to contract out for 
physicians. The inability of those hospitals that contract for physician services to include the Part A portion of
the services as contract labor has been perceived as inequitable. In States where hospitals may directly employ 
physicians, the hospitals may include some of these characteristically high wages in the wage data, while in States
where hospitals must contract for their physician services, these contract wages cannot be included in their 
wage data. 

We agree with the MTAG task force recommendation and are proposing to exclude all Part A physician costs on the Worksheet
S-3, Part II, regardless of whether the physician is a hospital employee or contractor. For purposes of this
exclusion, physician's salaries are defined as salaries applicable to positions that require a licensed physician,
such as a medical director of a department. Salaries for physicians employed in other positions, such as hospital
administrator, that do not require a physician would not be excluded.

Since this change would apply equally to hospitals that are permitted to employ physicians and to those that must contract
for physician services, we believe this proposal will promote payment equity and provide more uniformity in the wage
data across areas. This action should not require any additional reporting burden since these Part A physician salaries
already are reported on the cost report (Worksheet A-8-2). 

We believe that this proposal to eliminate Part A physicians' salaries is more appropriate than the alternative of
allowing all Part A physician costs (whether salaried or under contract) for three reasons. First, physician costs
are not driven by normal labor market situations and, in many cases, hospitals must hire physicians from outside of
their recruiting areas. Second, many hospitals have indicated difficulty in accurately determining the hours for
the physicians attributable to Part A services, especially for those under contract.

Third, we have found that some hospitals that employ 
physicians are not appropriately eliminating Part B 
physician salaries from the total salaries reported for the 
wage index as required in the cost reporting instructions. 
Accordingly, we are proposing that hospitals exclude all 
physicians' salaries (both Part A and Part B related) from 
the wage data reported on the Medicare cost report. In 
addition, we are proposing that the salaries for teaching 
physicians also be excluded, since payment for these 
services does not fall under the prospective payment system. 


Regarding Part A CRNA (certified registered nurse 
anesthetist) costs, we propose to require hospitals to 
exclude these salaries from the wage data reported on the 
cost report. These Part A services are currently paid on a 
``pass-through'' basis, outside the prospective payment 
system. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to exclude 
these costs from the wage index. Moreover, this Part A 
pass-through provision is applicable to a limited number of 
hospitals (small rural hospitals). All other hospitals are 
paid for CRNA services under Part B of the Medicare program. 
Therefore, in order to ensure consistency across areas, we 
believe that no CRNA costs should be reflected in the wage 
index computation. CRNA services are generally excluded 
from the wage index as Part B services. Since the Part A 
portion was granted as a pass through for certain rural 
hospitals, it is currently included in wage index. 
We note that these changes are effective for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994 and 
will not affect the current reporting of physicians and CRNA 
salaries. 


2. Management Contracts 


The second major proposed change concerns the inclusion 
of certain management contracts in the hospital wage index 
data. Before FY 1994, the wage index did not include any 
costs associated with contract services. However, many 
hospitals indicated that they were inappropriately 
disadvantaged because they were forced to contract out for 
nurses and technicians due to shortages of these services in 
their areas. To alleviate this problem, we revised the cost 
report to collect the data associated with any direct 
patient care service contract (that is, nursing, 
therapeutic, etc.). We specifically excluded any Part B 
services, Part A physician services, management contracts, 
or any contract for services not directly involved with 
patient care. 
The hospital industry has expressed concern that we do 
not currently recognize the cost of certain contract 
management services. In particular, many rural hospitals 
that are either unable to recruit or cannot afford top 
managers such as hospital administrators must contract for 
the services of these individuals. Therefore, we believe it 
is appropriate to include the costs of certain management 
contracts in the wage index. We propose to expand the 
definition of contract services reported on the Worksheet


S-3 to include the personnel cost associated with contracts 
for any personnel hired in the top four positions within the 
hospital. Allowable contract management services would be 
limited to the personnel costs for those individuals who are 
working at the hospital facility in the capacity of the 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/Hospital Administrator, Chief 
Operating Officer (COO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), or 
Nursing Administrator. The exact titles assigned to 
individuals may vary but the individuals should be 
performing essentially the same duties as customarily 
assigned these management positions. 


The hospitals (via HCFA-339 form) would be required to 
provide the fiscal intermediary with complete details on all 
direct patient care related contracts and the description 
and aggregate totals for all management contracts. Because 
of the difficulty in accurately determining hours and 
isolating wage related costs for the other types of contract 
services, the wage data would continue to exclude all other 
non-patient care contract services except those limited 
management contracts discussed above. 
Since the current cost report does not provide for the 
collection of management contract data, this revised 
definition would not be effective until cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994. To provide 
consistent reporting of data, hospitals must continue to 
exclude all management contracts until the FY 1995 data is 
reported. 


3. Reporting of Wage-Related Costs 


Since we began including fringe benefits in the wage 
index, we have been concerned with the inconsistent 
reporting of fringe benefits, whether because of a lack of 
provider proficiency in identifying fringe benefit costs or 
varying interpretations across fiscal intermediaries of the 
definition for fringe benefits in PRM-I,  2144.1. Although 
we have attempted to promote consistent reporting of fringe 
benefits by providing fiscal intermediaries with general 
guidelines to be used in determining allowable fringe 
benefit costs, the intermediaries must necessarily make 
judgments as to whether certain costs qualify as a fringe 
benefit, and inconsistencies persist. 
Last summer, HCFA conducted a survey to determine what 
costs the health care industry thought should be recognized 
as fringe benefit costs. The survey consisted of a 
questionnaire with a yes/no response column and a column for 
comments. We received 238 responses from hospitals, fiscal 
intermediaries, state hospital associations, national 
hospital associations, state agencies, and bureaus and 
offices within HCFA. The results of those surveys were 
examined closely by the MTAG task force. 
Based on the recommendations of the task force, we are 
proposing several changes that we believe will promote more 
equitable and consistent reporting of wage-related costs for 
all hospitals. Where the term ``fringe benefit'' has been 
used in the past, we will now refer to these costs as ``wage- 
related costs'' for wage index purposes. We believe that 
this change in terminology will eliminate the confusion 
regarding those wage-related costs that we will allow to be 
incorporated in the wage index versus the definition of 
fringe benefits required by Medicare principles for cost 
reimbursement purposes. Accordingly, we are proposing to 
revise the Worksheet S-3, Part II to capture wage-related 
costs in three parts.

a. Wage-Related Costs (Core).

 For most hospitals, the wage-related costs used to 
develop the wage index would be limited to ``core'' wage-
related costs. The list of ``core'' wage-related costs 
includes all commonly recognized costs (which are similar to 
fringe benefits used for cost reimbursement purposes) that 
contribute significantly to the wage costs of a hospital and 
that are readily identifiable on the hospital records. 
These costs will also be listed on the revised HCFA-339 
form, and hospitals will be required to provide the 
intermediary with a detailed description of the wage-related 
costs in Exhibit 7. This description will allow the 
intermediary to review the appropriateness of each wage-
related cost. We believe that this core list includes 
virtually all significant wage-related costs, including 
those costs that are required by statute. 
To develop the list of core wage-related costs, the 
MTAG task force established a number of specific criteria. 
To be considered a core wage-related cost, one or more of 
the following criteria must be met: 
 The wage-related cost is provided at a significant 
financial cost to the employer. 
 The wage-related cost is of a type and nature that 
would generally be offered as a fringe benefit by most 
employers. 
 The perceived value of this wage-related cost is of 
such importance that it would influence an individual's 
employment decisions. 
 The wage-related cost is a mandatory requirement under 
Federal or State law (for example FICA, Federal and State 
unemployment, etc.). 
 Fees paid to external organizations that are directly 
associated with the core wage-related costs may be included 
as part of the wage-related cost (for example, actuarial 
fees, claim administration fees, IRS form preparation fees, 
etc.). 
The following is the proposed list of core wage-related 
costs:

 



(1) Retirement Costs: 
401(k) employer contributions 
Tax sheltered annuity (TSA) employer contributions 
Qualified and non-qualified pension plan cost 
Prior year pension service cost 
(2) Plan Administration Costs (Paid to external 
organization): 
401(k)/TSA plan administration fees 
Legal/accounting/management fees_pension plan 
Employee managed care program administration fees 
(3) Health and Insurance Costs: 
Health insurance (purchased or self-funded) 
Prescription drug plan 
Dental, hearing, vision plans

Life insurance (if employee is owner or beneficiary) 
Accident insurance (if employee is owner or beneficiary) 
Disability insurance (if employee is owner or beneficiary) 
Long-term care insurance (if employee is owner or 
beneficiary) 
Workmen's compensation insurance 
Retiree health care cost (only current year, not the 
extraordinary accrual required by FASB 106 (that is, the 
non-cumulative portion)) 
(4) Taxes: 
FICA_employers portion only 
Medicare taxes_employers portion only 
Unemployment insurance 
State or Federal unemployment taxes 
(5) Other: 
Executive deferred compensation 
Day care cost and allowances 
Tuition reimbursement 


b. Other Wage-Related Costs.

 A hospital may be able to report an additional wage-related cost that does not appear on the core list if it 
meets the following criteria: 
 The wage-related cost is provided at a significant 
financial cost to the employer. To meet this test the 
individual wage-related cost must be greater than 1 percent 
of total salaries after the direct excluded salaries are 
removed (Column 3, line 3 on Worksheet S-3, Part II). 
 Any wage-related cost that would be a fringe benefit if 
reported to the IRS as a fringe benefit. 
 The wage-related cost has not been furnished for the 
convenience of the provider. 
We note that those wage-related costs that are required 
to be reported to the IRS as salary (for example, loan 
forgiveness and sick pay accruals) would not be included as 
other wage-related costs, since the costs associated with 
these items are considered salaries and would already be 
included in the total salaries reported on line 1.01 of the 
Worksheet S-3, Part II. 


c. Wage-Related Costs (Excluded Area).

 
Wage-related costs associated with employees in areas 
of the hospital that are excluded from the data used to 
calculate the wage index (such as a hospital-based SNF) 
should be removed from the total wage-related costs. This 
is not a new policy; however, to ensure that hospitals are 
removing these costs, we have added a new line on the 
Worksheet S-3, Part II. 
In addition to the above changes, we are proposing 
that, beginning on or after October 1, 1994, hospitals use 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in 
developing the wage-related costs contained in the Worksheet 
S-3, Part II, for purposes of the hospital wage index. For 
all other purposes, however, Medicare principles will 
continue to apply in determining the allowability of fringe 
benefit costs. The MTAG task force recommended application 
of GAAP for purposes of developing wage-related costs used 
to construct the hospital wage index. We believe it is 
appropriate to apply GAAP for these purposes because the 
function of the wage index is to measure 

relative

 hospital 
labor costs across areas. This function is distinct from 
that of cost reimbursement, in which applicable Medicare 
principles (which may differ from GAAP) measure the actual 
costs incurred by individual hospitals. We believe the 
application of GAAP for purposes of compiling data on wage-related costs used to construct the wage index will more

accurately reflect relative labor costs, because certain 
wage-related costs (such as pension costs) as recorded under 
GAAP tend to be more static from year to year. Application 
of Medicare principles, on the other hand, could create 
large swings in these costs from year to year, particularly 
in years when there are large over- or under-funded pension 
estimates; such application might lead to a wage index that 
does not accurately reflect relative labor costs. Again, we 
emphasize that under this proposal, GAAP will apply 

only

 for 
purposes of developing wage-related costs on Worksheet S-3 
Part II. Our policy requiring the use of applicable 
Medicare principles for determining fringe benefits for all 
other purposes remains unchanged. 
The revised cost report and the HCFA-339 forms are 
currently being evaluated by the Office of Management and 
Budget. Once these forms are approved, we propose to 
implement the form to collect wage data for any cost report 
beginning on or after October 1, 1994. However, we will 
issue subsequent revisions to the forms and instructions to 
reflect any changes incorporated in the final rule based on 
public comments. 


D. Revisions to the Wage Index Based on Hospital 
Redesignation 


Under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act, hospitals in 
certain rural counties adjacent to one or more Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas (MSAs) are considered to be located in one 
of the adjacent MSAs if certain standards are met. Under 
section 1886(d)(10) of the Act, the Medicare Geographic 
Classification Review Board (MGCRB) considers applications 
by hospitals for geographic reclassification for purposes of 
payment under the prospective payment system.

The methodology for determining the wage index values 
for redesignated hospitals is applied jointly to the 
hospitals located in those rural counties that were deemed 
urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act and those 
hospitals that were reclassified as a result of the MGCRB 
decisions under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act. Section 
1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act provides that the application of 
the wage index to redesignated hospitals is dependent on the 
hypothetical impact that the wage data from these hospitals 
would have on the wage index value for the area to which 
they have been redesignated. Therefore, pursuant to section 
1886(d)(8)(c) of the Act, the wage index values were 
determined by considering the following: 
 If including the wage data for the redesignated 
hospitals reduces the MSA wage index value by 1 percentage 
point or less, the MSA wage index value determined exclusive 
of the wage data for the redesignated hospitals applies to 
the redesignated hospitals. 
 If including the wage data for the redesignated 
hospitals reduces the wage index value for the area to which 
the hospitals are redesignated by more than 1 percentage 
point, the hospitals that are redesignated are subject to 
the wage index value of the area that results from including 
the wage data of the redesignated hospitals (the ``combined'' 
wage index value). However, the wage index value for the 
redesignated hospitals cannot be reduced below the wage 
index value for the rural areas of the State in which the 
hospitals are located. 
 Rural areas whose wage index values would be reduced by 
excluding the data for hospitals that have been redesignated 
to another area continue to have their wage index calculated 
as if no redesignation had occurred. Those rural areas 
whose wage index value increases as a result of excluding 
the wage data for the hospitals that have been redesignated 
to another area have their wage index calculated exclusive 
of the redesignated hospitals. 
 The wage index value for an urban area is calculated 
exclusive of the wage data for hospitals that have been 
reclassified to another area. However, geographic 
reclassification may not reduce the wage index for an urban 
area below the Statewide rural average, provided the wage 
index prior to reclassification was greater than the 
Statewide rural wage index value. 
 Section 13501(b) of Public Law 103-66 amended section 
1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act to provide that a change in 
classification of hospitals from one area to another may not 
result in the reduction in the wage index for any urban area 
whose wage index is below the rural wage index for the 
State. This provision also applies to any urban area that 
encompasses an entire State. 
We note that, except for those rural areas where 
redesignation would reduce the rural wage index value, and 
in the situation described above that was addressed by 
section 13501(b) of Public Law 103-66, the wage index value 
for each area is computed exclusive of the data for 
hospitals that have been redesignated from the area for 
purposes of their wage index. As a result, several MSAs 
listed in Table 4a have no hospitals remaining in the MSA. 
This is because all the hospitals originally in these MSAs 
have been reclassified to another area by the MGCRB. For 
those areas, we have listed the Statewide rural wage index 
value. 
The proposed revised wage index values effective for 
discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 are shown 
in Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c of the addendum to this proposed 
rule. Hospitals that are redesignated should use the wage 
index values shown in Table 4c. For some areas, more than 
one wage index value will be shown in Table 4c. This occurs 
when hospitals from more than one State are included in the 
group of redesignated hospitals, and one State has a higher 
Statewide rural wage index value than the wage index value 
otherwise applicable to the redesignated hospitals. Tables 
4d and 4e list the average hourly wage for each labor market 
area based on the FY 1991 wage data. In addition, we have 
expanded Table 3c (Hospital Case-Mix Indexes for Discharges) 
to include the average hourly wage for each hospital based 
on the FY 1991 data. The average hourly wage published in 
the final rule will be used by the MGCRB to evaluate if a 
hospital meets the reclassification criteria. Hospitals 
that choose to apply before publication of the final rule 
can use the proposed wage data in applying to the MGCRB for 
wage index reclassifications that would be effective for FY 
1996. We note that in adjudicating these wage 
reclassification requests during FY 1995, the MGCRB will use 
the average hourly wages for each hospital and labor market 
area that are reflected in the final FY 1995 wage index. 
The proposed FY 1995 wage index values incorporate all 
reclassification decisions made by the MGCRB for FY 1995. 
At the time this proposed wage index was constructed, the 
MGCRB had completed its review. There were 429 hospitals 
redesignated for purposes of the wage index (including 
hospitals redesignated under both sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 
1886(d)(10) of the Act). This number does not include MGCRB 
decisions that are still under review by the Administrator. 
Any changes to the wage index that result from 
withdrawals of requests for reclassification, wage index 
corrections, appeals, and the Administrator's review process 
will be incorporated into the wage index values published in 
the final rule. The changes may affect not only the wage 
index value for specific geographic areas, but also whether 
redesignated hospitals receive the wage index value for the 
area to which they are redesignated or a combined wage index 
that includes the data for both the hospitals already in the 
area and the redesignated hospitals. Further, the wage 
index value for the area from which the hospitals are 
redesignated may be affected. 
Under  412.273, hospitals that have been reclassified 
by the MGCRB are permitted to withdraw their applications 
within 45 days of the publication of this 

Federal Register

 
document. The request for withdrawal of an application for 
reclassification that would be effective in FY 1995 must be 
received by the MGCRB by [OFR: Insert date 45 days after 
date of publication]. A hospital that requests to withdraw 
its application may not request that the MGCRB decision be 
reinstated after publication of the final wage index values.

E. Impact of the Revised Hospital Wage Index 



Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that the wage index be updated annually beginning October 1, 1993. In addition,
this section requires that updates to the hospital wage index be budget neutral. The FY 1995 wage index will represent
the second annual update to the wage data. We will use the wage data from the FY 1991 Medicare cost report to calculate
the updated wage index. For FY 1995, the wage index will continue to include salaries, fringe benefits, home office
salaries, and certain contract labor salaries. In the past, updates to the wage data have resulted in significant
payment shifts among hospitals. Since the wage index is now updated annually and there are no changes to the types of
costs included in the wage index data, we expect these payment fluctuations will be minimized. Based on the proposed
wage index calculation (after reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act), there
is a significant drop, compared with previous years, in the number of labor markets that experience major increases
or decreases in wage index values. We reviewed the data for any area that experienced a wage index change of 10 percent
or more to determine the reason for the fluctuation. When necessary, we contacted the intermediaries to determine
the validity of the data, or to obtain an explanation for the change. Our review indicated that most of the significant
changes were attributable to improved reporting by hospitals. 

The following chart compares the shifts in wage index values (after reclassifications) for labor markets for FY 1995
with those experienced as a result of last year's wage index update.

Under the proposed FY 1995 wage index, 86.4 percent of 
all prospective payment hospitals (4,778 hospitals) would 
experience a change in their wage index value of less than 
5.0 percent. Approximately 5.2 percent (283 hospitals) 
would experience a change of between 5 and 10 percent, and 
8.4 percent (469 hospitals) would experience a change of 
more than 10 percent. The following chart shows the 
projected impact for urban and rural hospitals. (The totals 
in this chart exceed the number of hospitals in our 
database, as our projection includes new hospitals and 
hospitals that for other reasons are not included in our 
wage file.)






F. Occupational Mix Adjustment 



In its March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC recommended that 
the Secretary develop methods to collect more timely 
hospital wage data by occupational categories and to adjust 
the HCFA wage index for occupational mix (Recommendation 
15). 

The HCFA wage index reflects variations in the cost of 
labor; that is, it includes the effects of variations in the 
mix of occupations as well as the price of labor. ProPAC 
believes that the wage index should reflect only variations 
in the price of labor, which are beyond the hospital's 
control and are not otherwise accounted for by adjustments 
in the prospective payment system. 

Previous ProPAC studies on the effect of adjusting the 
wage index for occupational mix using data collected from 
California hospitals found that a wage index adjusted for 
occupational mix would redistribute funds from urban to 
rural hospitals. Within urban areas, the occupational mix 
adjustment would redistribute funds from large to small 
hospitals. Within rural areas, the occupational mix 
adjustment would increase the wage index values of all bed-size groups. ProPAC also reanalyzed the California data
to 
examine the impact of an occupational mix adjustment on wage 
index values based on hospital-specific labor market areas. 
ProPAC currently believes that the implementation of revised 
labor areas, including nearest neighbor labor markets, would 
substantially improve payment equity among hospitals if an 
occupational adjustment was developed. 

We are not convinced that an occupational mix 
adjustment would improve the accuracy of the wage index, as 
we have discussed most recently in the August 30, 1991 final 
rule (56 FR 43222). Currently, the wage index measures the 
overall costs of labor. If the wage index were to measure 
the price of labor, then a set of occupational weights would 
have to be developed to determine a standard occupational 
mix. Hospitals would not be compensated for a mix of 
employees above the standard, while hospitals with a mix of 
employees below the standard would be overcompensated, 
relative to their cost of labor. If we were to adopt 
hospital-specific labor market areas in conjunction with an 
occupational mix adjustment, one concern would be the 
application of occupational weights to every prospective 
payment hospital in the country. Application of one set of 
occupational weights to every prospective payment hospital 
would conflict with the intended purpose of hospital-specific labor markets, which is to make the wage index more

responsive to local conditions. We cannot envision a single 
set of occupational weights that could be applied to all 
prospective payment hospitals in an equitable manner. 

Last year, ProPAC suggested that we convene a working 
group made up of representatives from HCFA and the hospital 
industry to try to improve the timeliness and accuracy of 
the wage data. HCFA assembled such a discussion work group 
and presented ProPAC comments concerning the equity of 
adopting a method to collect data to assist in the 
development of an occupational mix. The discussion 
workgroup's consensus was that the data required to 
implement the proposal is not currently available and the 
likelihood of obtaining such data would be minimal. There 
seems to be little support among hospital industry 
representatives for developing a system that in their 
opinion clearly creates additional reporting burdens with an 
unproven or minimal impact on the distribution of payments. 
Therefore, at this time we are not proposing any changes to 
the collection of data to be used in developing an 
occupational mix adjustment.

G. Research on Refinements to Labor Market Areas 


1. Background 


Almost from the beginning of the prospective payment 
system, we have received comments from hospitals and ProPAC 
objecting to the use of MSA-based labor market areas to 
construct the wage index. Common concerns have been that 
the Statewide rural areas are too large to distinguish 
differences in labor market conditions, and that the MSA-based wage index does not reflect the fact that hospitals
in 
the center cities (the ``urban core'') pay higher wages than 
suburban hospitals. Some commenters have argued that rural 
labor market areas should be subdivided into two smaller 
groups based on county populations and that MSA-based labor 
market areas should be divided into urban core and suburban 
ring labor markets to distinguish the differences in labor 
market conditions. 
In light of these concerns, we have continued to 
examine a variety of options for revising wage index labor 
market areas. In this proposed rule, we discuss in detail 
issues raised by commenters concerning ProPAC's ``nearest 
neighbor'' recommendation, our research and analysis on 
alternative labor market areas, and the possibility of 
allowing all hospitals in a State to opt out of the current 
labor market system. 


2. Discussion of Comments Concerning ProPAC's Nearest 
Neighbor Recommendation 


In its March 1, 1993 report, ProPAC recommended that 
the Secretary substantially revise the hospital wage index 
under the prospective payment system for FY 1994. In its 
March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC made the same recommendation 
(Recommendation 16). Specifically, ProPAC recommends that 
we develop hospital-specific labor market areas based on 
geographic proximity, using each hospital's ``nearest 
neighbors'' for purposes of a revised wage index. As in 
1993, ProPAC has also recommended that Congress repeal the 
current statutory provisions relating to geographic 
reclassification for the wage index. 
In ProPAC's 1993 report, the Commission discussed 
establishing each hospital's labor market area based on its 
10 nearest neighbors within a 50-mile radius. In its 1994 
report, ProPAC examined defining labor markets for each 
hospital by including the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile radius, and extending the radius up to 30 or 35 miles

when needed in order to include a total of at least 3 
hospitals. 
In our May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30242), we 
stated that we believed, and ProPAC agreed, that legislation 
would be required before we could use hospital-specific 
labor market areas in constructing the wage index due to the 
statutory requirements regarding hospital reclassifications 
for wage index purposes. We also stated that in addition to 
the statutory constraints, we did not believe that it would 
be feasible or advisable to attempt to implement ProPAC's 
recommendation in FY 1994. Although we acknowledged that 
ProPAC's recommendation might have promise, we indicated 
that careful analysis of the impact of such a proposal on 
hospitals was necessary before proposing to adopt such a 
significant change. In addition, we stated there were also 
a number of administrative issues that must be carefully 
considered before ProPAC's proposal could be implemented, 
including the possible development of an exceptions or 
appeals process to resolve disputes concerning the labor 
market areas. We agreed with ProPAC that if we adopted 
hospital-specific labor market areas using its methodology, 
the MGCRB as it is currently constituted might no longer be 
necessary. We also stated that we would not recommend that 
Congress repeal the MGCRB provisions of the Act until we had 
analyzed fully the implications of adopting hospital-specific labor market areas or some other revisions to labor

market areas. We noted that after our analysis was 
complete, we would decide whether to recommend that the 
mission of the MGCRB be altered to make it responsible for 
resolving disputes concerning hospital-specific labor market 
areas. 
To facilitate a thorough analysis of ProPAC's proposal, 
we published in the FY 1994 proposed rule hospital-specific 
wage index values using ProPAC's data on hospital locations 
and the new FY 1990 hospital wage data (58 FR 30457). The 
tables indicated what each hospital's wage index value would 
be if the wage index were based on the wage data for the 
hospital and its 10 nearest neighbors up to a radius of 50 
air miles. The tables also showed which hospitals were in 
each hospital's labor market area based on ProPAC's data 
base. Subsequently, we discovered a technical error in the 
wage index values and republished a revised wage index value 
for each hospital in a correction notice (June 29, 1993, 58 
FR 34742).

We solicited public comments on ProPAC's proposal and 
suggestions concerning the development of an exceptions or 
appeals process, if appropriate, for possible implementation 
in FY 1995. We also solicited comments on a number of other 
issues such as the feasibility of using road miles instead 
of air miles, a process to verify hospital locations, and 
what the process should be to establish a wage index for new 
hospitals. We stated that we planned to continue our 
analysis of alternatives based on the current MSA based 
system that have appeared promising in the past, and that we 
planned to evaluate all potential labor market revisions 
using the same basic criteria. Comments on these issues 
were due to HCFA by August 31, 1993. 
In both the proposed and final rules for FY 1994, we 
stated our intention to analyze the comments we received as 
well as to conduct the research we outlined. We also stated 
that we would continue to consult with ProPAC and study any 
additional information they developed. We stated our 
intention to publish a proposal for formal public comment in 
the FY 1995 proposed rule if hospital-specific labor market 
areas based on the nearest neighbor concept proved 
promising. We indicated that we would include information 
describing all aspects of our proposal, and consider all 
comments, before issuing a final rule for implementation. 
In response to the May 26, 1993 proposed rule, we 
received a total of 266 comments on the nearest neighbor 
wage index proposal, including 28 from national, State, and 
local organizations representing hospitals. In all, 33 
commenters were in favor of the nearest neighbors proposal, 
128 were opposed and 105 were in support if changes were 
made to satisfy their concerns. The areas of major concern 
raised by the commenters were the redistribution of Medicare 
payments that would occur if hospital-specific labor market 
areas were adopted, how the boundaries should be drawn 
around hospitals to define labor market areas, and the 
nature and extent of an exceptions process. Several 
commenters also had reservations about whether a hospital's 
nearest neighbors were reflective of its labor market area. 
We discuss these and other issues below. 
 

Redistribution of Medicare Payments

_Many commenters 
were concerned about whether instituting hospital-specific 
labor market areas would lead to major shifts in Medicare 
payments at the same time that hospitals face an uncertain 
financial future because of the impact of health care 
reform. One state hospital association noted that adoption 
of the nearest neighbors proposal would cause a major 
redistribution of payments among rural hospitals, and that 
many hospitals that would be adversely affected were already 
in precarious financial condition. Another state 
association commented that the effects of the proposal on 
the hospitals in its State would vary greatly, with 
substantially increased payments to some hospitals and 
decreased payments to others. Many commenters suggested 
that if we were to adopt the nearest neighbors proposal, 
some type of phase-in over several years would be essential. 
 

Definition of Labor Market Areas

_Several commenters 
stated that hospital characteristics such as size, services 
offered, and case mix are a more reliable determinant of who 
a hospital competes with for labor than who its nearest 
neighbors are. One state association stated that its 
analysis of the wage index computed under the nearest 
neighbors proposal demonstrates that geographic proximity 
does not provide an accurate measure of the amount a 
hospital must pay to compete for labor. Since there are a 
wide range of options for defining hospital-specific labor 
market areas, many of the commenters suggested variations 
depending on their perception of what new labor market areas 
should achieve. Some favored changing the size of labor 
market areas so as to increase payment to a particular 
hospital or type of hospital, while others favored defining 
labor markets in a way that would decrease the payment 
shifts that would occur under the options. 
In order to minimize the payment changes that would 
result from the wage index, some groups supported including 
a larger number of hospitals in each labor market, while 
others supported limiting the size of labor market areas. 
One state association asserted that both nearest neighbor 
and fixed boundary labor market alternatives are problematic 
because neither method allows a sufficient amount of 
flexibility for determining labor market areas. The 
association believes that it would be more accurate if the 
direction and distance of worker commuting patterns were 
incorporated into the determination of a hospital's nearest 
neighbors. Another association stated that it may be 
difficult to identify a uniform approach that is equitable 
for all areas of the country, and urged HCFA to consider 
using different methodologies in different regions as 
appropriate. A national association stated that while the 
nearest neighbors proposal has conceptual appeal, whether 
the association would support a nearest neighbor proposal 
ultimately would depend on where HCFA draws the line around 
hospitals.

Exceptions Process

_Most of the commenters agreed 
that some type of exceptions process would be needed 
regardless of which system for defining hospital labor 
market areas is developed. Several commenters stressed the 
need for an exceptions process to address geographic 
anomalies; cases in which air miles are not equivalent to 
road miles; and cases in which a hospital is grouped with 
unlike hospitals, such as a rural referral center (RRC) 
grouped with much smaller primary care hospitals or a 
tertiary care hospital in a single hospital MSA that is 
grouped with much smaller rural hospitals. Another 
commenter supported giving a hospital the right to appeal to 
add or delete hospitals from its labor market area if the 
target hospital can demonstrate substantial labor market 
competition (or a lack of it) with a specific hospital. 
Some commenters supported special exception criteria for 
RRCs. One group believes that the nearest neighbors 
proposal should be modified to accommodate RRCs that 
otherwise would have been reclassified, that have only other 
rural hospitals in their nearest neighbors group, or that 
would be significantly harmed by the proposal. Another 
group believes that RRCs should be excluded from a nearest 
neighbors wage index and that they should be allowed to use 
either their own hospital-specific wage index or be allowed 
to reclassify into the nearest MSA using the existing MGCRB 
rules. 
 

Multi-campus hospitals

_We received a wide range of 
comments concerning multi-campus hospitals. Some commenters 
suggested that the hospital's location should be its main 
address listed on the cost report. Other commenters 
suggested that the facility with the largest concentration 
of employees be defined as the hospital's location, or that 
a hospital should be allowed to pick which campus would be 
considered its location for labor market area purposes. 
 

Hospital Location Verification

_Some commenters 
suggested that we publish each hospital's longitude and 
latitude and require them to submit documentation to verify 
any requests for corrections to this data. Others suggested 
that we use the Global Positioning System to verify 
location. Some commenters suggested that the hospital's 
emergency room entrance should be used as the hospital's 
location, others suggested the main employee entrance, and 
still others suggested that a hospital be allowed to 
designate any point on its campus as its location. 
 

State Boundaries

_Some commenters stated that labor 
market areas should not be constructed across State lines 
because cost of living and labor costs can vary greatly from 
State to State due to differences in State tax structures, 
costs of health insurance and other employee benefit 
programs dependent on State law. 
 

Blend/Floor

_Some commenters suggested that a nearest 
neighbors wage index should not be adopted unless a 
hospital's own wage data were weighted more heavily than 
those of its neighbors. Other commenters suggested that we 
institute a floor below which a hospital's wage index could 
not fall or that we blend the current wage index with any 
index based on revised labor market definitions. 


3. Analysis of Alternative Labor Market Areas 


We agree with commenters, and with ProPAC, that 
improvements to the current labor market system should be 
explored. Below, we discuss the feasibility of several 
alternative methodologies for establishing labor markets, 
including revised versions of the current MSA-based system, 
various hospital-specific methodologies, as well as an 
alternative that combines the hospital-specific and MSA-based methodologies. In evaluating each of the alternatives

presented, we considered the major issues raised by 
commenters, ProPAC's recommendations, as well as our own 
internal research and analysis. ProPAC's data on air-mile 
distances between hospitals were used to develop wage 
indexes based on hospital-specific systems. 
We note that in our May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 
30244), we indicated that we would hold a meeting with a 
working group consisting of hospital industry 
representatives to review potential revisions to labor 
market areas, and other issues related to the wage index. 
On November 19, 1993, HCFA staff met with 17 representatives 
of State and national hospital associations to discuss 
options for redefining hospital labor market areas and other 
issues related to the current wage index. A ProPAC 
representative also attended and presented information on 
the status of the Commission's current research. HCFA staff 
presented information on each of the options under 
consideration. 
The group expressed no preference for any of the 
hospital-specific or MSA-based options with the possible 
exception of a hospital-specific wage index based in large 
part on the hospital's own wages. The group was extremely 
concerned about the redistribution of dollars that would 
occur if nearest neighbors labor market areas were adopted 
in the current budgetary climate. It was also concerned 
about how an exceptions process would function under any 
revised labor market scheme, fearing that it would be too 
subjective and that it would be impossible to predict how 
many hospitals would be reclassified. 


a. MSA-based and Hospital-Specific Alternatives.

 
In our labor market research, we reviewed a large 
number of options: nine hospital-specific wage indexes 
based on the nearest neighbor and fixed radius approaches 
and seven MSA-based indexes involving ways of subdividing 
MSAs or statewide rural areas. Following is a description 
of the options we reviewed. We have assigned each option a 
name to facilitate discussion and for use in tables that 
follow later in this section.

Hospital-Specific Alternatives 


10 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each 
hospital's own wage data and that of its 10 nearest 
neighbors, or all hospitals within a distance of 50 miles, 
if there are fewer than 10 other hospitals within 50 miles. 
One hundred ninety-five hospitals had no neighbor within 50 
miles. These hospitals were assigned their own relative 
wage level, which is computed by comparing its own wages to 
the national average hourly wage. The same 195 hospitals 
also were assigned their ``own wage index'' for the 15 Nearest 
Neighbors and 20 Nearest Neighbors wage indexes. 
10 Nearest Neighbors/Minimum of 2_A wage index based on 
each hospital's own wage data and that of its 10 nearest 
neighbors within 20 miles (with a minimum of at least 2 
nearest neighbors within 20 miles or all hospitals within 35 
miles). 
15 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each 
hospital's own wage data and that of its 15 nearest 
neighbors, or all hospitals within a distance of 50 miles if 
there are fewer than 15 other hospitals within 50 miles. 
15 Nearest Neighbors/Minimum of 2_A wage index based on 
each hospital's own wage data and that of its 15 nearest 
neighbors within 20 miles (with a minimum of at least 2 
nearest neighbors within 20 miles or all hospitals within 35 
miles). 
20 Nearest Neighbors_A wage index based on each 
hospital's own wage data and that of its 20 nearest 
neighbors, or all hospitals within 50 miles if there are 
fewer than 20 other hospitals within 50 miles. 
20-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own 
wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 20-mile 
radius. The 887 hospitals having no neighbor within 20 
miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 
25-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own 
wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 25-mile 
radius. The 522 hospitals having no neighbor within 25 
miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 
30-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own 
wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 30-mile 
radius. The 391 hospitals having no neighbor within 30 
miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 
35-Mile Radius_A wage index based on each hospital's own 
wage data and that of all its neighbors within a 35-mile 
radius. The 301 hospitals having no neighbor within 35 
miles were assigned their own relative wage level. 


MSA-Based Alternatives 


These alternatives represent various subdivisions (by 
counties) of the current MSA/rural labor market area 
definitions. As such, all counties in each subdivided 
category need not be contiguous. 
Central-Outlying_A wage index in which each MSA is 
divided into 2 areas based on its central and outlying 
counties. 
Rural-Population_A wage index in which each Statewide 
rural area is divided into 2 distinct labor market areas, 
one including all counties with populations greater than 
25,000 and one made up of counties with populations less 
than 25,000. 
Rural-Density_A wage index in which each Statewide rural 
area is divided into 2 areas if it contains counties with 
population densities greater and less than 35 persons per 
square mile. 
Rural-Population/Density_A wage index in which each 
Statewide rural area is divided into as many as 4 areas 
depending on whether populations are greater or less than 
25,000 person and population densities are greater or less 
than 35 persons per square mile. 
Rural-Adjacent_A wage index in which each Statewide rural 
area is divided into 2 areas, one including all counties 
adjacent to an MSA and the other made up of counties not 
adjacent to an MSA. 
Rural-Population/Adjacent_A wage index in which each 
Statewide rural area is divided into as many as 4 areas 
depending on the adjacent/non-adjacent status of its non-MSA 
counties and whether county populations are greater or less 
than 25,000 persons.

Rural-Density/Adjacent_A wage index in which each 
Statewide rural area is divided into as many as 4 areas 
depending on the adjacent/non-adjacent status of its non-MSA 
counties and whether county population densities are greater 
or less than 35 persons per square mile. 
As a basis of comparison for these alternatives, we 
also reviewed three variations of the current MSA-based wage 
index. 


Current MSA-based Indexes 


Geographic_The FY 1994 hospital wage index without the 
effects of geographic reclassification. 
Reclassification_The actual FY 1994 hospital wage index 
after reclassification. 
Estimated FY 1995_The FY 1994 hospital wage index revised 
to include an estimate of the effects of geographic 
reclassification in FY 1995 (based on FY 1990 data). 
We used three basic criteria to analyze each of the 
alternatives: 
(1) 

Wage Conformity Within Labor Markets.

 This 
criterion assesses the extent to which a wage index conforms 
to a hospital's own relative wage level. It also evaluates 
the extent to which a hospital's wages are aberrant for its 
labor market area (that is, are more than one standard 
deviation above the labor market wage index); 
(2) 

Wage Index Conformity Across Labor Markets (Boundary 
Problems).

 This criterion measures the extent to which the 
new labor market areas reflect uniform labor market 
conditions as indicated by the degree of similarity in the 
hospital wage rates across labor market areas. The 
boundaries should minimize inequitable treatment, that is, 
cases in which hospitals facing similar labor costs are 
grouped into different labor markets. 
(3) 

Distributional Equity Improvement.

 This criterion 
examines the impact of a labor market option to determine 
its effects on the distribution of hospital payments, and 
the extent to which the hospitals that would gain and lose 
under various proposals are already doing well or poorly 
under the current system. Redistribution of payments should 
fairly compensate both high-wage hospitals and low-wage 
hospitals. 
None of the options we initially reviewed were a 
significant improvement over the current reclassified wage 
index in terms of wage conformity within labor markets, wage 
conformity across labor markets, or distributional equity 
improvement. The following tables summarize our major 
results: 


Wage Conformity Within Labor Markets 


Table A displays the number of hospitals for which the 
difference between the area wage index value for a given 
alternative and the hospital's own relative wage index value 
(determined by dividing the hospital's average hourly wage 
by the national average hourly wage) is greater than .08 
either positive or negative. A .08 difference in the wage 
index was selected as it represents approximately a $200 
difference in payments per case. For each wage index 
option, the Lose and Gain columns show the number of 
hospitals for whom the difference represents a given 
decrease or increase in wage index value. 
Table B displays the number of hospitals whose wage 
index values are more than 108 percent above their labor 
market wage index value (that is, one standard deviation 
greater).

Wage Conformity Across Labor Markets 



Table C presents the assessment of wage conformity across labor markets. We determined that a ``boundary problem''
existed for a target hospital (that is, the hospital whose wage index value is being calculated) if_

 Among nearby hospitals, one or more other hospitals' wage index value is at least .04 greater than that of the
target hospital, corresponding to approximately a $100 difference in payments per case, and 

 The hospital with the lower wage index value pays higher wages than the hospital with the higher wage index value.


``Nearby hospitals'' were defined as the 20 nearest hospitals or if a hospital does not have 20 other hospitals within
a 35 mile radius, all hospitals within a 35 mile radius. Table C shows the number of hospitals with one or more boundary
problems and the average size of the wage index difference for those boundary problems. An average wage index difference
of .12 corresponds to a payment difference of about $300 per case. 

Table D shows the effects that different labor market alternatives would have when compared to the current FY 1994
pre-reclassified wage index.

As demonstrated by the above tables, our analyses showed that none of the MSA-based options consistently outperformed
the current estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index in terms of wage conformity within labor market 
areas and wage conformity across labor market areas. 

With respect to wage conformity within labor market areas, the results in Table A demonstrate that the 20-mile radius
hospital-specific option, with 549 losing hospitals, best reduces the number of hospitals with wage index values

more than .08 below their own wage level. The FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index was second best, with 590 hospitals
with wage index values more than .08 below their own wage level. The 20-mile radius approach also produced the fewest
number of hospitals (1014) with wage index values more than .08 above their own wage levels. However, as demonstrated
in Table B, the estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index outperformed the other labor market options, with
only 559 hospitals whose own average hourly wages were 108 percent or more of their respective labor market area's
average hourly wage. Therefore, the 20-mile radius and the estimated FY 1995 post-reclassified wage indexes 
demonstrated somewhat better outcomes for wage conformity within labor market areas than any of the other options
we studied. 

With respect to wage conformity across labor market areas (``boundary problems''), as indicated in Table C, the estimated
FY 1995 post-reclassified wage index generated the fewest hospitals having boundary problems (662), with the central-outlying
MSA option having the second lowest number of such hospitals (712). All of the nearest neighbor options, including
the 20-mile radius option (with 1,041 hospitals), had the effect of significantly increasing the number of boundary
problems that would occur, although the 
problems were of a smaller magnitude. 

Overall, none of the MSA-based options or the nearest neighbor options consistently outperformed the current estimated
FY 1995 post-reclassification wage index. While the 20-mile radius option performed well in terms of wage 
conformity within labor market areas, it performed significantly worse than the current system with respect to wage
conformity across labor market areas. Additionally, with respect to the distributional effects of all the options,
none demonstrated any measurable improvement in payment equity across hospital groups. Therefore, we are not presenting
any tables concerning the distributional effect in this discussion. We have decided not to propose 
changes to labor market areas for FY 1995 because we believe that neither revisions to the current MSA-based system
or the nearest neighbors labor market options that we studied constitute a clearly demonstrable improvement over
the current system. 



b. Options for Future Wage Index Refinements Using Combined 
MSA/Hospital-Specific Approach.

 While none of the alternative labor market areas that we studied, whether based on current MSA definitions or the ``nearest
neighbor'' approach, provided a distinct improvement over the current reclassification wage index, we believe
a classification system that uses a combination of both approaches has considerable potential for improving the
wage index. Discussed below are some options for further study that we believe may offer a viable alternative to the
current system by taking into consideration all of the varying factors that affect a hospital's labor market. Each
of these options is based on a weighted average of each hospital's own average hourly wages and the average hourly wages
of a group of other hospitals. The following concepts and assumptions underlie the wage index options that we are now
analyzing: 

 Empirically defining labor market areas in a highly accurate, definitive manner is extremely difficult,
if not impossible. MSAs and statewide rural areas may be reasonably accurate in many cases, but in other cases, these

areas may be larger than a hospital's ``true'' labor market area. None of the methodologies we studied for subdividing
MSAs and/or statewide rural areas or for designing nearest neighbor labor market areas proved to have been demonstrably
more accurate than the current system.

 Both a hospital's own wage data and that of other hospitals in its vicinity may contain relevant information
about the level of wages in the hospital's true labor market. In particular, a hospital's own data may reflect 
specific circumstances of the hospital's labor market that we have yet to discover in our analysis of the data, but
that reflect geographic variation that Medicare would want to capture in the wage index. 

 No matter how we determine labor market areas, both a hospital's own wage data and that of other hospitals assigned
to its labor market area may contain any number of spurious sources of variation, including data errors, that should
not be captured in the wage index. The larger the number of hospitals whose data are averaged, the more the effects of
spurious factors are reduced. 

To address all of these considerations, we have designed for comment and future study an approach that uses the current
MSA system but generally gives a hospital's own wages a higher weight than under the current system. (We 
have assigned each hospital's own wages a weight sufficient to ensure that in no case would the weight of a hospital's
own wages be reduced below its current level.) We believe that a hospital's own wages, to some degree, reflect its specific
labor market conditions. Hence, a hospital's wage 
index would be more representative of these labor market conditions if a higher weight was assigned to its own wages
than typically occurs in large MSA or statewide rural area labor markets. If this approach results in situations in
which a hospital's wage level continues to be significantly higher than the combined average hourly wage used to construct
its wage index, we would provide an exceptions mechanism whereby a hospital's wage index would be derived entirely
or in part from its ``nearest neighbor'' labor market area. 

We are considering two alternative wage indexes based on this approach. The first of two wage indexes we considered
places a 25 percent (.25) weight on each hospital's own average hourly wage and a 75 percent weight (.75) on the average
hourly wage of the other hospitals in each hospital's MSA or statewide rural area. However, if a hospital's data represent
more than 25 percent of the hours in the MSA or statewide rural area in which it is located, then, in calculating the hospital's
wage index, that higher percent was used instead of the 25 percent weight. The resulting weighted average hourly wage
is divided by the national average hourly wage to obtain each hospital's wage index value. For purposes of discussion,
this wage index is 
denoted as ``Minimum 25'' or ``M25''. 

The second wage index differs from the first alternative only in that a minimum weight of .50 is given the hospital's
own average hourly wage, instead of a minimum 25 percent. This wage index is denoted as ``Minimum 50'' or ``M50''. 

However, we recognize that in some cases a hospital's immediate labor market area as defined under a ``nearest neighbor''
approach may be more representative of its true labor market area than an MSA-based labor market area. To address such
situations, we have developed a mechanism that 
would essentially provide a hospital with an alternative wage index derived entirely or in part from its nearest neighbors
labor market. Currently, we are examining two methods for reclassification, a ``simple'' method and a 
``refined'' method. Both methods utilize the two wage indexes just introduced, and like the current MGCRB reclassification
system, also require a hospital's own wages to exceed certain thresholds to meet eligibility. These thresholds 
are as follows: 

The first threshold would be used to identify hospitals whose own wage levels are still aberrant when using the Minimum
25 or Minimum 50 wage indexes. We set this threshold at the mean plus 1.0 standard deviation of the 
ratio of each hospital's own average hourly wage to the weighted sum of its own average hourly wage plus the average
hourly wage of the other hospitals in the MSA or Statewide rural area in which the hospital is located. For the M25 
wage index, the threshold would be 1.07. That is, a hospital's average hourly wage would have to equal at least 107 percent
of the weighted average hourly wage used to develop its wage index in order to qualify for reclassification. For the
M50 wage index, the threshold would be 1.05. 

 The second threshold, which would be used to identify hospitals whose wages are comparable to the hospitals
in the immediate (that is, nearest neighbor) labor market area, was set at 83 percent, which equals the mean minus 1
standard deviation of the ratio of each hospital's average hourly wage to the average hourly wage of its nearest 10
neighbors. 

Under the ``simple'' reclassification methodology, there would be only a single adjustment available to a hospital
that demonstrates that its wages are aberrant within its labor market area (that is, it meets both thresholds 
discussed above). The basis for the adjustment is evidence that the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in its
MSA or statewide rural area is not representative of the average hourly wage in the hospital's actual labor market.
A common reason that the MSA's average hourly wage may not be representative of a particular hospital's actual wage
costs is that the MSA is too large and comprises multiple labor markets. 

To qualify for reclassification under this method, a hospital would have to meet a third criterion. The average hourly
wage of a hospital's nearest 10 neighbors (with a minimum of at least 2 neighbor hospitals within 20 miles or 
all hospitals within 35 miles) would have to exceed the average hourly wage of the other hospitals in its MSA or statewide
rural area. If this is the case, then the average hourly wage of the hospital's nearest 10 neighbors would be 
substituted for the MSA or statewide rural average hourly wage in calculating the numerator of the hospital's wage
index. Under this reclassification scheme a hospital's own wages would be given the same weight as in the MSA-based
alternative wage index (M25 or M50).

The ``refined'' reclassification methodology would add a 
second basis for adjusting a reclassified hospital's wage 
index. This was developed to assist hospitals whose 
situation warrants a different nearest neighbor approach. 
For example, it is possible that a hospital's data could 
represent more than 25 percent, or even 50 percent, of the 
total hours when combined with its 10 nearest neighbors. 
However, the same hospital's data very likely might 
represent a much lower percentage of the total hours in the 
MSA or statewide rural area in which it is located. This 
refined method would allow a hospital to use not only the 
average hourly wage of its 10 nearest neighbors, but also 
its hours weight when combined with its 10 nearest 
neighbors. So, in addition to the test of the 
representativeness of the other hospitals' average hourly 
wage described above, there would be a test of the 
appropriateness of substituting its hours weight from the 
hospital's immediate labor market for the weight that would 
otherwise be used (.25, .50, or its MSA/statewide rural 
hours weight). A reclassified hospital's hour weight 
reflected in the wage index would be adjusted under this 
method if two criteria are met. First, a hospital's share 
of the total hours in its nearest 10 neighbors ``labor 
market'' would have to exceed its hour weight in its 
MSA/statewide rural labor market. Second, the use of the 
nearest neighbors' hours weight would have to increase the 
average hourly wage that comprises the numerator of its wage 
index value. If both criteria were met, then the nearest 
neighbors' weight would be substituted for the hours weight 
that would have been used were the hospital not 
reclassified. 
This refined reclassification methodology would allow 
for three different types of reclassification groups under 
which a hospital's wage index would be calculated by using 
one of the following: (1) The nearest neighbors' average 
hourly wage and the MSA hour weight; (2) the nearest 
neighbors' hours weight and the MSA-based average hourly 
wage; or (3) both the nearest neighbors' weight and average 
hourly wage. The following tables summarize our findings 
under each of the options we examined in comparison with the 
current labor market system. 
Table E displays the number of hospitals for which the 
difference between the area wage index value for a given 
alternative and the hospital's own relative wage index value 
(determined by dividing the hospital's average hourly wage 
by the national average hourly wage) is greater than .08, 
either positive or negative. For each wage index option, 
the Lose and Gain columns show the number of hospitals for 
whom the difference represents a given decrease or increase 
in wage index value. 
Table F presents the assessment of wage conformity 
across labor markets. We determined that a ``boundary 
problem'' existed for a target hospital (that is, the 
hospital whose wage index value is being calculated) if_

 Among nearby hospitals, one or more other hospitals' 
wage index value is at least .04 greater than that of the 
target hospital, and 
 The hospital with the lower wage index value pays 
higher wages than the hospital with the higher wage index 
value. 
``Nearby hospitals'' were defined as the 20 nearest 
hospitals or if a hospital does not have 20 other hospitals 
within a 35 mile radius, all hospitals within a 35 mile 
radius. Table F shows the number of hospitals with one or 
more boundary problems and the average size of the wage 
index difference for those boundary problems. An average 
wage index difference of .12 corresponds to a payment 
difference of about $300 per case.

Table G shows the effects of the two possible 
reclassification schemes as compared to the current 
reclassification system. Table H shows the effects the 
different labor market alternatives would have when compared 
to the current FY 1994 pre-reclassified wage index.

As demonstrated in the above tables, we believe these 
options for refining the wage index show promising results. 
All four of the wage index options significantly reduce the 
number of boundary problems, as seen in Table F. Not only 
would the number of boundary problems be reduced, but the 
boundary problems that do remain would be smaller, 
especially for the M50 wage indexes where the average 
difference is 0.067 for both the simple and refined 
reclassification methods. As indicated in Table E, these 
wage index options produce wage index values that would more 
closely resemble a hospital's own wage level, as was 
expected. Table G demonstrates that the new 
reclassification methods would likely affect a larger number 
of hospitals than the current system. Whereas in the 
current system, we estimated that only 362 hospitals qualify 
for the wage index reclassification, under the M25 wage 
index the simpler reclassification method would lead to 411 
hospitals being adjusted to their nearest neighbors' average 
hourly wage. The refined reclassification method under the 
M25 wage index would make it possible for 250 hospitals to 
use the nearest neighbors' average hourly wage, 161 
hospitals to use both the nearest neighbors' average hourly 
wage and hours weight, and 110 hospitals to use just the 
nearest neighbors' hours weight. We show the effects the 
four new options would have when compared to the estimated 
1995 post-reclassified system against the current 1994 pre-
reclassified values in Table H. 
We plan to continue our evaluation of these new wage 
index options in the coming months and are soliciting public 
comment. We will continue to accept comments on these wage 
index refinements until August 31, 1994. We will respond to 
these comments in the FY 1996 prospective payment system 
proposed rule. Comments on this issue should be sent to: 
Lana Price, Director; Division of Hospital Payment Policy; 
1-H-1 East Low Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, 
Maryland 21207. 
While we believe the alternatives discussed above offer 
much promise with respect to refining the hospital wage 
index, we do not believe that sections 1886(d)(2), (3) and 
(8) of the Act authorize a hospital-specific wage index 
scheme that combines each hospital's own wages and the wages 
of other hospitals in its MSA or Statewide rural area using 
different hour weights. Moreover, the MGCRB provisions 
under section 1886(d)(10) of the Act contemplate wage index 
reclassifications from one area to another that cannot be 
reasonably implemented consistent with these alternatives. 
Therefore, before we could implement these alternatives, 
legislative changes would be necessary to allow the 
Secretary greater flexibility in refining the hospital wage 
index. Again, we invite public comments on these issues by 
August 31, 1994, so that we may consider them in our 
continuing evaluation of wage index refinements.

H. State Labor Market Option 


In addition to the alternatives discussed above, we are 
also considering a State labor market option (SLMO) under 
which hospitals would be able to voluntarily design labor 
market areas within their own State boundaries. Although we 
are not formally proposing the SLMO at this time, we welcome 
comments on this option. Under the SLMO, an application to 
design labor market areas could be submitted by a group of 
hospitals or any entity that represents hospitals that would 
be affected under the SLMO (for example, a state hospital 
association, the Office of the Governor, etc.). The 
application would have to include a statement signed by each 
hospital's chief executive or chief financial officer 
supporting participation in the SLMO. 
The SLMO is being considered on the premise that 
hospitals within a State may, in some circumstances, have 
better information than HCFA concerning local labor market 
competition between hospitals. Accordingly, we are 
considering the SLMO along with the alternatives discussed 
above, which we believe would require legislative changes. 
Absent changes to the statute, we believe that the SLMO 
would offer opportunities for hospitals to design labor 
market areas that are more reflective of local wage 
conditions than the current system. 


1. Criteria for Participating in a SLMO 


Below we describe some of the criteria we would apply 
to determine whether labor market areas under the SLMO could 
be approved. (We have not fully designed or specified the 
limitations for creating labor market areas under the SLMO, 
and we are interested in any comments from the public for 
developing criteria under which a SLMO would be approved.) 
However, we envision that hospitals participating in a SLMO 
could design labor market areas under the following 
restrictions: 
 We are considering limiting approval of labor market 
areas under the SLMO to cases in which there is unanimous 
support among hospitals. (We may also consider use of 
``overwhelming support'' as a criterion rather than unanimous 
support. We likely would specify a percentage of 
participating hospitals that must support the SLMO labor 
market areas (for example, 75 percent). Such a criterion 
may also specify that to be approved, the SLMO labor market 
area must be supported by each hospital that would lose more 
than 5 percent of payments relative to the current system.) 
 Aggregate payments to hospitals participating in the 
SLMO could be no higher than they otherwise would have been 
in the absence of the SLMO. 
 All hospitals that participate in the SLMO must sign an 
application for it to become effective. Although the 
application could come from a group of hospitals or its 
representatives, each participating hospital must sign the 
application and agree to its provisions. In addition, each 
participating hospital must indicate in the application (or 
a separate agreement) that: 
The participating hospital waives its rights to any 
wage index it would otherwise receive absent the SLMO, 
including a wage index it might receive through geographic 
reclassification. 
The hospital understands how its participation in the 
SLMO would affect its prospective payments, including an 
understanding that the hospital's wage index could be higher 
or lower under the SLMO in comparison to its wage index 
under labor market areas in the absence of the SLMO. (The 
SLMO application would only have to specify that the 
hospital understands the effect of HCFA regulations 
regarding SLMOs and that there may be a reduction of their 
wage index as a result of participation. The hospital would 
not have to indicate the precise level of its wage index in 
the SLMO application.) 
Labor market areas under the SLMO would be 
automatically renewed each year for the purpose of 
calculating the wage index until one or more participating 
hospitals withdraws its support for the SLMO. 
 Labor market areas under the SLMO generally would be 
prohibited from crossing State boundaries. The only 
exception would be that hospitals from a bordering State may 
be included in a SLMO labor market area if they are 
currently located in an MSA that crosses a State boundary. 
In this case, the wage index would be calculated as if 
hospitals in the bordering State were included under the 
SLMO labor market area. For hospitals in the bordering 
State, the wage index would continue to be calculated as it 
is under the current system.

<TEXT>
 

Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that the 
Secretary establish the wage index for the purposes of 
adjusting payment rates for hospital inpatient services to 
reflect wages in a geographic area relative to the national 
average. For this reason, we are considering establishing a 
criterion that labor market areas under the SLMO must 
include all hospitals within a contiguous area or must have 
defined geographic boundaries or distance parameters. 
However, we are concerned that such a requirement may 
prevent hospitals in noncontiguous areas within a State that 
share similar demographic features from being grouped in one 
labor market area under the SLMO. We are also concerned 
that hospitals may be able to meet the contiguity 
requirement but design an area with an illogical 
configuration that may not represent a labor market area. 
For example, we do not believe it would be appropriate to 
approve an application for a new labor market area that 
groups 2 hospitals 100 miles apart but excludes the 
hospitals located in between. We are also concerned about 
approving a SLMO application under which the wage index 
would be based only on hospital-specific wages. Such an 
application would not reflect local market conditions based 
on contiguous geographic areas. Because of these concerns, 
we are soliciting public comments regarding appropriate 
criteria for approving labor market areas under the SLMO. 


2. Calculation of Budget Neutrality 


As noted above, we would require payments to hospitals 
under the SLMO to be budget neutral in relation to payments 
in the absence of the SLMO. We are considering alternatives 
for applying a budget neutrality adjustment. Because the 
budget neutrality calculation for the SLMO labor market 
areas would be made after the effects of reclassification, 
we expect that hospitals under a SLMO will continue to apply 
for reclassification as they do under the current system. 
Such reclassifications would be recognized both for purposes 
of computing the budget neutrality adjustment and computing 
the wage index values applicable to reclassified hospitals. 
We envision two options for applying the budget neutrality 
adjustment: 
 

Adjusting the wage index for the SLMO labor market 
areas. 

Under this option, there would be a single 
adjustment to the wage index that would affect all hospitals 
participating in the SLMO in equal proportions. 
 

Adjusting the wage index for selected hospitals within 
the SLMO labor market areas. 

Under this option, the 
application to create labor market areas under SLMO would 
specify how the budget neutrality adjustment would be 
applied. For example, it could be applied equally to all 
SLMO hospitals or it could be limited to selected hospitals. 
If the SLMO application does not specify how to apply 
the budget neutrality adjustment, the adjustment to the wage 
index would have a proportional effect on payments to all 
hospitals participating in a SLMO labor market area. (As 
indicated above, reclassification granted to hospitals 
participating in a SLMO would be recognized in computing the 
wage index values applicable to non-SLMO reclassified 
hospitals under section 1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act.) 


3. Effect on Hospitals Not Participating in the SLMO 


Hospitals that are not part of labor market areas under 
the SLMO would continue to have their wage index calculated 
under the current labor market areas_including the effects 
of reclassification. The wage index for these hospitals 
would continue to reflect the average hourly wage in their 
current labor market area relative to the national average. 
If a non-SLMO hospital were reclassified to an MSA that 
includes hospitals that are part of a SLMO labor market 
area, the wage index for the non-SLMO hospital would be 
calculated as if the SLMO did not exist. 
We note that hospitals in SLMO States that are not part 
of a redesigned labor market area would not necessarily have 
to be part of the budget neutrality adjustment and their 
support for the SLMO would not be needed. However, if they 
chose to be part of the budget neutrality adjustment, their 
support for the SLMO would be needed even if they were not 
included in a redesigned labor market areas. 


4. Process for Submitting a SLMO Proposal 


We are considering establishing the process described 
below for establishing labor market areas under the SLMO. 
Given that hospitals may apply both for geographic 
reclassification by the MGCRB and for a revised labor market 
area under the SLMO in the same year, our time frames for 
SLMO decisions may parallel the time frames used for 
reclassification decisions by the MGCRB. However, we expect 
that approval or rejection of SLMO applications would be 
made by HCFA's Bureau of Policy Development. The potential 
process would consist of the following: 
(1) The initial SLMO application would be made to HCFA 
and would include a statement from each participating 
hospital attesting to their support for labor market areas 
under the SLMO. 
(2) We envision providing notification to applicants 
of approval of the SLMO labor market areas before 
publication of our annual prospective payment system 
proposed rule (usually published in the 

Federal Register

 by 
May of each year). For hospitals whose SLMO application has 
been denied, we are considering providing an opportunity to 
submit additional information in support of a SLMO 
application. This information would be used by HCFA in 
reconsidering a denial before publication of the proposed 
rule.

<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Approval of SLMO labor market areas and the 
resulting proposed wage indices would be announced in the 
proposed rule. The proposed rule would include the wage 
index under the current labor market areas (including the 
effects of reclassification) and under the SLMO labor market 
areas. 

(4) Hospitals participating in the SLMO would be able 
to withdraw support for the SLMO during the 60-day comment 
period following publication of the proposed rule. If one 
or more hospitals withdraws support for a labor market area 
under the SLMO, the SLMO would not go into effect in the 
following fiscal year. To withdraw from the SLMO, the 
participating hospital would submit a letter to HCFA 
referencing the appropriate proposed rule and stating its 
participation in the SLMO labor market area is being 
withdrawn. 

(5) Absent any withdrawal of support for labor market 
areas under the SLMO, HCFA would announce labor market areas 
and wage indices under the SLMO in the prospective payment 
system final rule (published by September 1 of each year). 

(6) The labor market areas under the SLMO would be in 
effect for at least 1 Federal fiscal year following approval 
by HCFA. The SLMO labor market areas would be automatically 
renewed for following years unless a participating hospital 
informed HCFA in writing of its decision to withdraw. 



5. Special Issues Affecting the SLMO 



We are considering the following policies that would 
address the effects of special situations on the SLMO 
concept. 

 

New Hospitals_

If a new hospital is established in a 
SLMO labor market area after its approval, the wage index 
for the new hospital would be determined as it is under the 
current system for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
order for the SLMO labor market area to be renewed for the 
following fiscal year, the new hospital would have to inform 
HCFA in writing of its support for the SLMO labor market 
area. 

 

Ownership Changes and Hospital Mergers

_If there is 
an ownership change or hospital merger during the period 
that the SLMO labor market area is in effect, the SLMO would 
remain in effect for the remainder of the fiscal year. In 
order for the SLMO labor market area to be renewed for the 
following fiscal year, the new ownership would have to 
inform HCFA in writing of its support for the SLMO labor 
market area. 

We will accept comments on the SLMO until August 31, 
1994. These comments should be sent directly to: Lana 
Price, Director; Division of Hospital Payment Policy; 1-H-1 
East Low Rise; 6325 Security Boulevard; Baltimore, Maryland 
21207. Responses to these comments will appear in the FY 
1996 prospective payment system proposed rule.



I. Conclusion



Since the inception of the prospective payment system, we have repeatedly solicited comments concerning how labor
market areas used to construct the wage index should be defined. In recent years, we have also solicited comments concerning
specific proposals to modify or replace our current use of MSAs. For example, we have offered for public comment the
reclassification criteria used by the MGCRB and alternatives to the MSA-based system such as ProPAC's nearest neighbor
proposal and the options outlined in the present rule. In essence, therefore, we have been engaged in a continuing
dialogue with the public concerning whether it is appropriate to use MSAs to define labor market areas to construct
the wage index.

On June 30, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget announced the revised definitions for Metropolitan Areas (MA)
to reflect the MA standards published on March 30, 1990, and the demographic data drawn from the 1990 Decennial Census.
In that bulletin, OMB stated that in cases where an agency is publishing for comment a proposed regulation that would
use the MA definitions for a nonstatistical purpose, the agency should seek public comment on the proposed use of the
MA definitions. As indicated above, we are not proposing the options outlined in sections III G and H at this time. However,
consistent with OMB's bulletin and as part of our continuing review of the definitions used to define labor market
areas for wage index purposes, we are soliciting comments on the use of MSA definitions as incorporated in the options
described in this document.

IV. Other Proposed Changes to the Prospective Payment 
System for Inpatient Operating Costs 



A. Definition of and Payment for Transfer Cases ( 412.4) 



The prospective payment system distinguishes between 
``discharges'', situations in which a patient leaves an 
acute-care hospital after receiving complete treatment, and 
``transfers'', situations in which the patient is transferred 
to another acute-care hospital for related care. If a full 
DRG payment were made to each hospital involved in a 
transfer situation irrespective of the length of time the 
patient spent in the ``sending'' hospital prior to transfer, 
this would create a strong incentive to increase transfers, 
thereby unnecessarily endangering patients' health. 
Therefore, the regulations at  412.4(d) provide that, in a 
transfer situation, full payment is made to the final 
discharging hospital and each transferring hospital is paid 
a per diem rate for each day of the stay, not to exceed the 
full DRG payment that would have been made if the patient 
had been discharged without being transferred. 

Currently, the per diem rate paid to a transferring 
hospital is determined by dividing the full DRG payment that 
would have been paid in a nontransfer situation by the 
geometric mean length-of-stay for the DRG into which the 
case falls. Transferring hospitals are also eligible for 
outlier payments for cases that meet the cost outlier 
criteria established for all other cases (nontransfer and 
transfer cases alike) classified to the DRG. They are not, 
however, eligible for day outlier payments. Two exceptions 
to the transfer payment policy are transfer cases classified 
into DRG 385 (Neonates, Died or Transferred to Another Acute 
Care Facility) or DRG 456 (Burns, Transferred to Another 
Acute Care Facility), which are not paid on a per diem basis 
but instead receive the full DRG payment. 



1. Definition of a Transfer Case 



Under current policy, cases that are transferred from an 
acute-care area paid under the prospective payment system to 
a hospital or unit excluded from the prospective payment 
system are considered to be discharges (as opposed to 
transfers) from the acute-care hospital. As a discharge, 
payment for the case is the full DRG amount. 

The rationale for this policy was set forth in the 
initial hospital inpatient prospective payment interim final 
rule with comment period, which was published on 
September 1, 1983. In that document, we stated that: ``* * * 
Hospitals and units excluded from the prospective payment 
system are organized for treatment of conditions distinctly 
unlike treatment encountered in short-term acute care 
facilities. Therefore, the services obtained in excluded 
facilities would not be the same services obtained in 
transferring hospitals (that is, paid under the prospective 
payment system), and payment to both facilities would be 
appropriate.'' (See 48 FR 39759.) Thus, since the 
prospective payment hospital was assumed to be providing a 
full course of acute inpatient care before transfer to the 
excluded hospital or unit for additional care and treatment, 
we believed it was appropriate to pay the prospective 
payment hospital the full DRG amount. 

For the most part, inpatient hospital services furnished 
by hospitals and hospital units excluded from the 
prospective payment system are paid on a reasonable cost 
basis, subject to a cost per discharge limit. This payment 
does not vary by source of admission or discharge 
destination. Under   412.22 through 412.29, the following 
types of facilities are identified as being excluded from 
the prospective payment system: psychiatric hospitals and 
distinct part units; rehabilitation hospitals and distinct 
part units; long-term care hospitals; cancer hospitals; 
children's hospitals; hospitals outside the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; Veterans 
Administration and other Federal hospitals; and 
nonparticipating hospitals furnishing emergency services to 
Medicare beneficiaries. Also listed in  412.22(c) (2) and 
(3) are hospitals paid under approved State cost control 
systems and hospitals reimbursed in accordance with 
authorized demonstration projects. Under  412.4(b)(3)(i), 
patients moving from an acute-care hospital paid under the 
prospective payment system to hospitals within either of 
these categories are currently considered transfers, and 
therefore they are not referred to in the following 
discussion. 

Since implementation of the prospective payment system 
over 10 years ago the distinctions between the types of 
services provided in acute-care hospitals and excluded 
hospitals and hospital units have become less clear. 
Acute-care hospitals may have an incentive to reduce patient 
lengths of stay, and thus patient costs, in order to 
maximize profits since payment is no longer linked to actual 
costs. This has led to a steady increase in the numbers of 
excluded hospitals and units, as well as postacute-care 
facilities, as acute-care hospitals look to discharge 
patients whom heretofore they were treating until the 
patients were ready to be discharged to their homes. (See 
Langenbruner et al., 

Health Care Financing Review, 

Spring 
1989.) 

As part of a study of Medicare transfer cases funded by 
HCFA (``Transfers of Medicare Hospital Patients under the 
Prospective Payment System'', PM-191-HCFA, January 1994), 
RAND examined trends in transfer episodes from FY 1987 to FY 
1991. RAND's analysis found that, from 1987 to 1991, while 
transfers from one prospective payment system setting to 
another increased 4.1 percent, transfers from a prospective 
payment system setting to excluded rehabilitation units and 
excluded psychiatric units increased 18.9 percent and 7.0 
percent, respectively. We believe that this growth in 
transfers to excluded hospital units is an indication that 
the distinction in the types of services provided in short-
term acute-care settings and excluded settings is not as 
significant as it was in 1983.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, in section VI.A. of this preamble, we are proposing revised criteria for determining whether an entity
qualifies for exclusion from the prospective payment system as a separate long-term care hospital. This proposed
change is in response to situations where hospitals are manipulating the process for recognition as a separate Medicare
provider in order to circumvent the prospective payment system exclusion rules. For example, some hospitals have
begun to organize themselves under what they themselves refer to as the ``hospital within a hospital'' model. The
effect of such a reorganization is to grant an exclusion to what is, for all practical purposes, a long-term care hospital
unit, even though section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act limits the exclusion from the prospective payment system for hospital
units to rehabilitation and psychiatric units. 

We believe that the motivation for such arrangements is primarily financial and may lead to inappropriate transfers
that are not necessarily in the best interests of patients' health and well-being. We strongly believe that patients
should be treated in settings that are best suited to provide the levels of care the patients need. Decisions regarding
the most appropriate setting should be based on clinical criteria. To help ensure that this occurs, to the greatest
extent practicable, financial incentives should be neutral regarding the setting wherein a patient is treated.
This means matching payments as nearly as possible to the resources required to treat the patient. We believe our current
definition of transfer cases provides financial 
incentives on the acute-care side to transfer patients to excluded hospitals and units in order to reduce lengths
of stay and at the same time receive payment at the full DRG amount. These incentives exist whether the acute-care 
hospital is transferring patients to its hospital-based excluded units or to other excluded hospitals. 

For these reasons, we are proposing to change our definition of a transfer case by adding new  412.4(b)(4) to
include cases transferred from an acute-care setting paid under the prospective payment system to an excluded hospital

or unit. We believe that this policy would more appropriately pay those prospective payment hospitals that are transferring
patients to an excluded hospital or unit before completion of a course of treatment. This policy 
would extend to cases transferred to all excluded hospitals and units, Veterans Administration hospitals, other
Federal hospitals, and hospitals not participating in Medicare. Discharges to non-hospital settings, such as skilled
nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities, would still be 
paid as discharges. 



2. Payment for Transfer Cases 



Since the inception of the prospective payment system, there has been concern that a flat per diem payment rate for
transfer cases fails to account for the likelihood that the beginning of a patient's hospitalization is the most resource
intensive portion of the stay. Comments received in response to the September 1, 1983 interim final rule recommended
that the transferring hospital should receive either the full DRG amount or should be paid on a sliding scale to reflect
the higher costs of the first few days of a 
patient's stay. Our response at that time was that little or no data were provided in support of this position (49 FR
245, January 3, 1984). 

Last year, in the May 26, 1993 proposed rule, we responded to a ProPAC recommendation concerning payment of transfer
cases and described the preliminary results of the analysis undertaken by RAND to evaluate the adequacy of our transfer
payment policy (58 FR 30245). RAND found that 
among cases transferred prior to reaching the mean length-of-stay, 1-day stays cost 2.096 times the per diem payment
amount for cases in nonsurgical DRGs (based on the geometric mean length of stay) and 2.576 times the per diem for 
surgical DRGs. Among nonsurgical transfer cases, the costs of 2-day stays are about 1.215 times the per diem payment
amount, and cases transferred after 2 days cost about 10 percent more than the applicable per diem amount. Among 
surgical cases, the costs of stays of 2 or more days are actually about 7 percent below the applicable per diem amount.


To evaluate the impact of replacing the flat per diem methodology with one designed to reflect the observed relationship
between costs and the first few days of hospitalization, RAND simulated a transfer payment methodology that multiplies
the per diem amounts by the coefficients referred to above. The improvement in payment-to-cost ratios for per diem
transfer cases was significant, from 0.7224 under current policy to 0.9722 using the scaled per diem. 

We did not propose a change to the transfer payment policy last year, however, due to concerns over the specification
of the transfer payment formula. First, the coefficients used to graduate the per diem amount are 
dependent on the specification of the model and the data employed. Ensuring the continued validity of the per diem
weighting factors would require frequent reestimation as other payment parameters change and more recent data become
available. 

Second, we were concerned that weighting the per diem amounts by the coefficients directly from the regression may
overstate the precision of the estimates of costs per day prior to transfer. Because available data do not attribute
charges or costs to a particular day, the estimated costs for each additional day reflect the incrementally higher
costs per case compared to transfers occurring 1 day earlier. If, in transfers occurring after 3 or more days, for example,
costs per day were more evenly distributed than the graduated per diem payments, the coefficients in the regression
might not reflect the costs of additional days.

<TEXT>
 

This leads to a third concern, that the graduation of the scaled per diem amounts may generate inappropriate incentives
to transfer patients as soon as possible, that is, before the point at which costs equal payments. This 
incentive could arise, for example, for cases in which payments early in a patient's stay are greater than costs (that
is, cases with more even costs throughout the stay rather than high costs in the first day or two). In such 
cases, the longer the patient stays in the hospital, the more likely that total costs will approach total payments.
Under this scenario, a hospital seeking to maximize its profit could do so by transferring the patient as soon as possible.


In order to address these concerns and to pay hospitals more appropriately for the treatment they furnish to patients
before transfer, we are proposing at  412.4(d)(1) to pay transfers twice the per diem amount for the first day

of any transfer stay plus the per diem amount for each of the remaining days prior to transfer, up to the full DRG amount.
We believe this method will improve the payment equity for transfer cases in a straightforward way while 
alleviating our concerns about a steeply graduated per diem based directly on regression coefficients. We are proposing
that this change be applied uniformly for both medical and surgical transfer cases; although surgical transfer cases
appear to be more costly, on average, the first day, they are relatively less costly for the second day and beyond. 

Using the graduated per diem methodology we are proposing, RAND estimated the payment-to-cost ratio of transfer
cases that were transferred prior to reaching the geometric mean length of stay would be 0.9321. While this is somewhat
less than the payment-to-cost ratio for nontransfer cases (0.9645), it represents a significant improvement over
the current ratio for these cases (0.7224). 

Since publication of the September 1, 1993 final rule, RAND has completed the second and final phase of its study. This
phase of the study focused on the receiving hospitals and how they fare under our current transfer payment policy.
Their findings in this regard were more ambiguous than in the case of sending hospitals. RAND performed regressions
on transfer cases in receiving hospitals to determine whether these cases were more expensive than nontransfer cases
within the same DRGs. They found no consistent relationship. 

Over 60 percent of all transfer cases were assigned DRGs from MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the Circulatory System).
According to RAND, ``* * * for the surgical DRGs in MDC 5 (DRGs 104 through 116), the costs of transfer
cases relative to nontransfer cases at the same hospital range from almost the same (in DRG 106, coefficient = 0.007)
to about 11 percent greater (DRG 105, coefficient = 0.105). In the medical DRGs in MDC 5, the range is even wider, with
transfers received into DRG 121 and 122 actually costing less than other cases in the same DRG at the same hospital and
transfers received in DRG 127 costing 37 percent more.'' (See RAND page 40.) 

Based on these results, RAND did not recommend and we are not proposing any change in the payments for the receiving
hospital in a transfer episode. That is, if the receiving hospital is also the final discharging hospital, 
they will be paid the full DRG amount plus any outlier payments they are eligible to receive (under either the day or
cost outlier thresholds). If the patient is transferred again prior to discharge, then, under the change we are 
proposing, the sending hospital in this second transfer episode would be paid using the graduated per diem methodology,
rather than the flat per diem rate they currently receive. 



B. Review of DRG Assignments ( 412.60) 



Under the provisions of  412.60(d), a hospital has 60 days from the date of the notice of the initial DRG assignment
of a claim to request review of that assignment. The hospital may submit additional information as part of 
its request. The intermediary reviews the request and any additional information and decides if a change in the assignment
is appropriate. Any change by the intermediary to a higher-weighted DRG must be reviewed by the hospital's Peer Review
Organization (PRO) to determine if the request and the change are appropriate. 

Under the first PRO contract cycle, this review was conducted on a postpayment basis. However, the second PRO contract,
effective July 1, 1986, required that this review be conducted on a prepayment basis. Therefore, 
 412.60(d)(2) currently provides that the intermediary must request that the PRO review any change in assignment
to a higher-weighted DRG.

<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the fourth contract cycle, the PROs are no longer required to review these cases on a prepayment basis. Rather,
the cases are flagged and the PRO conducts a 100 percent review after payment. Therefore, we are proposing to revise
 412.60(d)(2) to conform the regulations to current practice. At the same time, we would revise an incorrect
cross-reference to the regulations that govern the PROs' review of these DRG reassignments. The correct cross-reference
is  466.71(c)(2). 



C. National Average Standardized Amounts for FY 1995 ( 412.63) 



Section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act directs the Secretary to compute national average standardized amounts for use
in determining payments for inpatient operating services, updated annually by the applicable percentage increase
set 
forth under section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. Under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, for FYs 1988 through 1994,
the Secretary has computed separate national average standardized amounts for large urban, other urban and rural

areas. However, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act requires that, for discharges occurring after October 1,
1994, the average standardized amounts for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized
amount for hospitals located in an other urban area. We note that hospitals located in a rural area will continue to
be considered rural for all other payment purposes, such as the disproportionate share adjustment. 

The Secretary has been applying updates to the average standardized amounts for each fiscal year as provided under
section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. For FY 1995, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act directs the Secretary to update
the rural national average standardized amount by the amount necessary to make it equal to the other urban national
average standardized amount. 

Current  412.63(m) already reflects the requirement that, for discharges occurring after October 1, 1994,
we will pay for inpatient hospital services based on national average standardized amounts for large urban and other

areas. Thus, there will no longer be separate national average standardized amounts for other urban and rural areas.
However, we are proposing to make several technical changes to  412.63(m) and (r), concerning computation
of 
Federal rates, to eliminate now obsolete references to the rural and other urban standardized amounts and replace
them with references to the standardized amounts for other areas. In the addendum to this proposed rule, we provide
a description of the updates being proposed for FY 1995 under 
the requirements of sections 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) and 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act. 



D. Outliers (  412.80, 412.82 and 412.84) 



Section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act provides that, in addition to the basic prospective payment rates, payments must
be made for discharges involving day outliers and may be made for cost outliers. Under section 1886(d)(3)(B) of 
the Act, the Secretary has been required to separately reduce the urban and rural national standardized amount by
the proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to outliers in each respective area. Beginning with

FY 1995, section 1886(d)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended by section 4002(c)(2)(B)(iii) of Public Law 101-508,
requires the Secretary to reduce the large urban and other national standardized amounts by the same factor to account
for the proportion of total DRG payments made to outlier cases. (As 
explained in section IV.C. of this preamble, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act specifies that beginning in FY
1995, the standardized amount for other urban and rural areas will be equal, with the result that there will be only

two standardized amounts, one for large urban areas and one for all other areas.) Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iv) of the
Act requires that the urban and other standardized amounts applicable to hospitals in Puerto Rico be reduced by the

proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to estimated outlier payments. Furthermore, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv)
of the Act directs that outlier payments in any year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of total payments
projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment rates. 

Section 13501(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66) amended section 1886(d)(5)(A)
of the Act with respect to outliers beginning in FY 1995. With regard to cost outliers, section 13501(c) of Public Law
103-66 requires that the Secretary modify the methodology for determining the cost outlier threshold. Formerly,
section 1886(d)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act specified that a hospital can receive payment for a cost outlier if the adjusted
costs for a discharge exceed the greater of a fixed dollar amount or a fixed multiple the DRG payment for the case. As
amended by section 13501(c)(2) of Public Law 103-66, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act now specifies that,
for discharges on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital 
may receive payment for a cost outlier if adjusted costs exceed the DRG prospective payment rate plus a fixed dollar
amount determined by the Secretary. We will refer to this revised cost outlier threshold as ``fixed loss.'' A further
discussion of the methodology for determining the fixed loss 
is provided below. 

Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66 also amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act with respect to day outliers.
Beginning with FY 1995, section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to reduce the proportion of 
total outlier payments paid under the day outlier methodology. Under the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v)
of the Act, the proportion of outlier 
payments paid under the day outlier methodology, relative to the proportion of outlier payments in FY 1994, shall
be 75 percent in FY 1995, 50 percent in FY 1996 and 25 percent in FY 1997. Under the provisions of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(i)
of the Act, the Secretary will no longer pay for day outliers after September 30, 1997. As indicated in the table published
in our September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348), we estimated that 18 percent of FY 1994 
outlier payments would be for outliers meeting the day outlier threshold only, while 13 percent would meet the day
and cost outlier thresholds and be paid under the day outlier methodology. Thus, a total of 31.3 percent of total 
outlier payments in FY 1994 would be paid as day outlier cases. Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act, we propose
setting the day outlier thresholds for FY 1995 through FY 1998 so that day outlier payments approximate the following
proportion of total outlier payments: 

 FY 1995_24 percent (75 percent of 31.3 percent). 

 FY 1996_16 percent (50 percent of 31.3 percent). 

 FY 1997_8 percent (25 percent of 31.3 percent). 

As payments to day outliers are reduced, there will be a corresponding increase in payments to cost outliers.

1. FY 1995 Outlier Thresholds 



For FY 1994, the day outlier threshold is the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 23 days or 3.0
standard deviations. The marginal cost factor (or the percent of Medicare's average per diem payment paid for each
outlier day) for day outliers is equal to 55 percent in FY 1994. The cost outlier threshold is the greater of 2.0 times
the prospective payment rate for the DRG or $36,000 ($33,000 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective
payment system for inpatient capital-related costs). The marginal cost factor (or the percent of costs paid after
costs for the case exceed the threshold) for cost outliers is 75 percent. 

For FY 1995, we propose to set the day outlier threshold at the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser
of 22 days or 3.0 standard deviations. Section 13501(c)(3) of Public Law 103-66 provides that the additional
payments for outlier cases may be different than the hospital's marginal cost of care during the transition period
phasing out payments to day outliers. We are proposing to revise  412.80 to reflect this provision. We 
also propose to revise  412.82(c), so that it does not specify a marginal cost factor of 55 percent. HCFA will
specify the level of the marginal cost factor during the day outlier phase-out in the annual prospective payment system
rulemaking process. 

Our proposed policy would reduce the proportion of outlier payments paid to day outliers as required by section 1886(d)(5)(A)
of the Act. We are proposing to accomplish the required reduction in payments to day outliers for 
FY 1995 solely through a reduction in the marginal cost factor rather than through an increase in the threshold. To
determine the marginal cost factor necessary to achieve the mandated reduction in outlier payments, we simulated
both the current and proposed outlier policies. Based on these simulations, we determined that a reduction in the
marginal cost factor to 49 percent is necessary to achieve the required 25 percent reduction in the proportion of payments
paid under the day outlier methodology. Therefore, we are proposing to reduce the marginal cost factor from 55 percent
in FY 1994 to 49 percent in FY 1995. 

We are also proposing a fixed loss cost outlier threshold in FY 1995 equal to the prospective payment rate for the DRG
plus $23,300 ($21,400 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for 
capital-related costs). The fixed loss threshold would replace the current threshold, which is equal to the greater
of 2.0 multiplied by the DRG payment for the case or $36,000. We are proposing the fixed loss threshold under 
the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act. We believe the fixed loss threshold is an improvement over current
policy because it focuses Medicare's outlier payments on the most costly cases. Under current policy, it 
is possible that cases in certain high-weight DRGs can incur losses significantly greater than $36,000 before Medicare
will make an outlier payment. (We note that the fixed loss threshold is adjusted by the wage index, similar to the current
cost outlier threshold. Thus, hospitals that are 
paid based on a wage index value of less than 1.0 will have this threshold reduced while other hospitals will be paid
based on a higher threshold.) 

To further focus Medicare's cost outlier payments on the costliest cases, we are proposing to increase the marginal
cost factor from 75 percent to 80 percent. We note that raising the marginal cost factor to 80 percent is 
consistent with a recommendation made by ProPAC in its March 1, 1994 annual report. While we are raising the marginal
cost factor for cost outlier cases to 80 percent, we are continuing to set the cost and day outlier thresholds in 
order to maintain the estimated 5.1 percent proportion of total DRG payments paid as outliers. 

The thresholds we would propose if we were not implementing the change in the day and cost outlier payment methodology
required by section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v) of the Act and discussed above would be: 

 Day outliers_The geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 21 days or 3 standard deviations.


 Cost outliers_The greater of 2.0 times the prospective payment rate for the DRG or $31,000. 

We estimate that the proposed FY 1995 outlier thresholds would result in 76 percent of outlier cases paid using the
cost outlier methodology and 24 percent paid using the day outlier methodology. Cases that meet the day outlier threshold
but that would be paid using the cost outlier methodology, because it yields the higher payment, would represent 20
percent of all outlier cases. Our simulation of FY 1995 outlier payments based on FY 1993 
MedPAR data indicates that the percentage of outlier cases that would qualify as day outliers is approximately 67
percent. The cases qualifying as day outliers would receive 69 percent of operating outlier payments in FY 1995. 
An estimated 33 percent of outlier cases would be cost-only outlier cases, which would receive about 31 percent of
operating outlier payments.

When we modeled the combined operating and capital 
outlier payments, we found that using a common set of 
thresholds resulted in a slightly higher percentage of 
outlier payments for capital-related costs than for 
operating costs. We estimate the proposed thresholds for 
FY 1995 would result in outlier payments equal to 
5.1 percent of operating DRG payments and 6.3 percent of 
capital payments based on the Federal rate. 



2. Outlier Changes Planned for FY 1996 Through FY 1998 



As stated above, section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act 
requires us to phase out payments for day outliers over the 
FY 1995 through FY 1997 period. We currently expect to meet 
the statutory reductions in day outlier payments for FY 1996 
and FY 1997 solely through a reduction in the marginal cost 
factor without having to raise the day outlier threshold. 
If necessary, we will propose achieving the reduction in day 
outlier payments between FYs 1996 and 1997 through a 
combination of reducing the marginal cost factor and raising 
the threshold. There will be corresponding increases in 
payments to cost outliers as we phase-out payment to day 
outliers. We welcome comments on this issue. 



E. Rural Referral Centers ( 412.96) 



Under the authority of section 1886(d)(5)(C)(i) of the 
Act,  412.96 sets forth the criteria a hospital must meet 
in order to receive special treatment under the prospective 
payment system as a rural referral center. For discharges 
occurring before October 1, 1994, rural referral centers 
receive the benefit of payment based on the other urban 
payment rate rather than the rural payment rate. As of that 
date, the other urban and rural payment rates will be the 
same. However, rural referral centers will continue to 
receive special treatment under both the disproportionate 
share hospital payment adjustment and the criteria for 
geographic reclassification. 

One of the criteria under which a rural hospital may 
qualify as a referral center is to have 275 or more beds 
available for use. A rural hospital that does not meet the 
bed size criterion can qualify as a rural referral center if 
the hospital meets two mandatory criteria (number of 
discharges and case-mix index) and at least one of three 
optional criteria (medical staff, source of inpatients, or 
volume of referrals). With respect to the two mandatory 
criteria, a hospital is classified as a rural referral 
center if its_

 Case-mix index is at least equal to the lower of the 
median case-mix index for urban hospitals in its census 
region, excluding hospitals with approved teaching programs, 
or the median case-mix index for all urban hospitals 
nationally; and 

 Number of discharges is at least 5,000 discharges 
per year or, if fewer, the median number of discharges for 
urban hospitals in the census region in which the hospital 
is located. (The number of discharges criterion for an 
osteopathic hospital is at least 3,000 discharges per year.) 



1. Case-Mix Index 



Section 412.96(c)(1) provides that HCFA will establish 
updated national and regional case-mix index values in each 
year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for 
purposes of determining rural referral center status. In 
determining the proposed national and regional case-mix 
index values, we would follow the same methodology we used 
in the November 24, 1986, final rule, as set forth in 
regulations at  412.96(c)(1)(ii). Therefore, the proposed 
national case-mix index value includes all urban hospitals 
nationwide, and the proposed regional values are the median 
values of urban hospitals within each census region, 
excluding those with approved teaching programs (that is, 
those hospitals receiving indirect medical education 
payments as provided in  412.105). 

These values are based on discharges occurring during 
FY 1993 (October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993), and 
include bills posted to HCFA's records through 
December 1993. Therefore, in addition to meeting other 
criteria, we are proposing that to qualify for initial rural 
referral center status for cost reporting periods beginning 
on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital's case-mix index 
value for FY 1993 would have to be at least_

 1.3028; or 

 Equal to the median case-mix index value for urban 
hospitals (excluding hospitals with approved teaching 
programs as identified in  412.105) calculated by HCFA for 
the census region in which the hospital is located. 

The median case-mix values by region are set forth in 
the table below: 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00078 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




The above numbers will be revised in the final rule to the 
extent required to reflect the updated MedPAR file, which 
will contain data from additional bills received for 
discharges through September 30, 1993. 

For the benefit of hospitals seeking to qualify as 
referral centers or those wishing to know how their case-mix 
index value compares to the criteria, we are publishing each 
hospital's FY 1993 case-mix index value in Table 3C in 
section V of the addendum to this proposed rule. In keeping 
with our policy on discharges, these case-mix index values 
are computed based on all Medicare patient discharges 
subject to DRG-based payment. 



2. Discharges 



Section 412.96(c)(2)(i) provides that HCFA will set 
forth the national and regional numbers of discharges in 
each year's annual notice of prospective payment rates for 
purposes of determining referral center status. As 
specified in section 1886(d)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act, the 
national standard is set at 5,000 discharges. However, we 
are proposing to update the regional standards. The 
proposed regional standards are based on discharges for 
urban hospitals' cost reporting periods that began during 
FY 1992 (that is, October 1, 1991 through 
September 30, 1992). That is the latest year for which we 
have complete discharge data available. 

Therefore, in addition to meeting other criteria, we 
are proposing that to qualify for initial rural referral 
center status for cost reporting periods beginning on or 
after October 1, 1994, the number of discharges a hospital 
must have for its cost reporting period that began during 
FY 1993 would have to be at least_

 5,000; or 

 Equal to the median number of discharges for urban 
hospitals in the census region in which the hospital is 
located, as indicated in the table below.

<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We reiterate that, to qualify for rural referral center 
status for cost reporting periods beginning on or after 
October 1, 1994, an osteopathic hospital's number of 
discharges for its cost reporting period that began during 
FY 1993 would have to be at least 3,000. 



3. Retention of Referral Center Status 



Section 412.96(f) states that each hospital receiving 
the referral center adjustment is reviewed every 3 years to 
determine if the hospital continues to meet the criteria for 
referral center status. To retain status as a referral 
center, a hospital must meet the criteria for classification 
as a referral center specified in  412.96 (b)(1) or (b)(2) 
or (c) for 2 of the last 3 years, or for the current year. 
A hospital may meet any one of the three sets of criteria 
for individual years during the 3-year period or the current 
year. For example, a hospital may meet the two mandatory 
requirements in  412.96(c)(1) (case-mix index) and (c)(2) 
(number of discharges) and the optional criterion in 
paragraph (c)(3) (medical staff) during the first year. 
During the second or third year, the hospital may meet the 
criteria under  412.96(b)(1) (rural location and 
appropriate bed size). 

A hospital must meet all of the criteria within any one 
of these three sections of the regulations in order to meet 
the retention requirement for a given year. That is, it 
will have to meet all of the criteria of  412.96(b)(1) or 
 412.96(b)(2) or  412.96(c). For example, if a hospital 
meets the case-mix index standards in  412.96(c)(1) in 
years 1 and 3 and the number of discharge standards in 
 412.96(c)(2) in years 2 and 3, it will not meet the 
retention criteria. All of the standards would have to be 
met in the same year. 

The requirement for triennial review was originally 
added to the regulations in 1984, to be effective for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1987 (the 
end of the first 3 years of the referral center adjustment). 
However, three statutory moratoriums on the performance of 
the triennial reviews were enacted by Congress. The third 
of these moratoriums expires at the end of cost reporting 
periods that began during FY 1994. (See the 
September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46310) for a detailed 
explanation of the moratorium and the implementation of the 
triennial reviews.) 

With the expiration of the current moratorium, we will 
begin reviewing each rural referral center's compliance with 
the triennial review criteria effective with cost reporting 
periods beginning on and after October 1, 1994. As noted 
above, although rural referral centers will no longer be 
paid a higher standardized amount than other rural 
hospitals, hospitals approved as rural referral centers 
continue to be entitled to higher disproportionate share 
payments and continue to receive preferential consideration 
before the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. 
Therefore, we believe it is important that only those 
hospitals that meet the rural referral center triennial 
review criteria continue to be so classified. Thus, 
effective with cost reporting periods beginning on and after 
October 1, 1994, a hospital that has been classified as a 
referral center for at least 3 years will be subject to the 
triennial review criteria as discussed below. 

In accordance with  412.96(f)(2), the review process 
is limited to the hospital's compliance during the last 
3 years. Thus, if a hospital meets the criteria in effect 
for at least 2 of the last 3 years or if it meets the 
criteria in effect for the current year (that is, the 
criteria for FY 1995 outlined above in this section of the 
preamble), it will retain its status for another 3 years. 
No hospital is subject to a review until the end of its 
third full cost reporting period as a referral center. We 
have constructed the following chart and example to aid 
hospitals that qualify as referral centers under the 
criteria in  412.96(c) in projecting whether they will 
retain their status as a referral center. 

Under  412.96(f), to qualify for a 3-year extension 
effective with cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995, 
a hospital must meet the criteria in  412.96(c) for FY 1995 
or it must meet the criteria for 2 of the last 3 years as 
follows:

Example: A hospital with a cost reporting period 
beginning July 1 qualified as a referral center effective 
July 1, 1992. The hospital has fewer than 275 beds. Its 
3-year status as a referral center is protected through 
June 30, 1995 (the end of its cost reporting period 
beginning July 1, 1994). To determine if the hospital 
should retain its status as a referral center for an 
additional 3-year period, we will review its compliance with 
the applicable criteria for its cost reporting periods 
beginning July 1, 1992, July 1, 1993, and July 1, 1994. The 
hospital must meet the criteria in effect either for its 
cost reporting period beginning July 1, 1995, or for two out 
of the three past periods. For example, to be found to have 
met the criteria at  412.96(c) for its cost reporting 
period beginning July 1, 1993, the hospital's case-mix index 
value during FY 1991 must have equaled or exceeded the lower 
of the national or the appropriate regional standard as 
published in the September 1, 1992 final rule. The 
hospital's total number of discharges during its cost 
reporting year beginning July 1, 1991, must have equaled or 
exceeded 5,000 or the regional standard as published in the 
September 1, 1992 final rule. 

For those hospitals that seek to retain referral center 
status by meeting the criteria of  412.96(b)(1)(i) and (ii) 
(that is, rural location and at least 275 beds), we will 
look at the number of beds shown for indirect medical 
education purposes (as defined at  412.105(b)) on the 
hospital's cost report for the appropriate year. We will 
consider only full cost reporting periods when determining a 
hospital's status under  412.96(b)(1)(ii). This definition 
varies from the number of beds criterion used to determine a 
hospital's initial status as a referral center because we 
believe it is important for a hospital to demonstrate that 
it has maintained at least 275 beds throughout its entire 
cost reporting period, not just for a particular portion of 
the year. 



F. Determination of Number of Beds in Determining the 
Indirect Medical Education Adjustment ( 412.105) 



Section 1886(d)(5)(B) of the Act provides that 
prospective payment hospitals that have residents in an 
approved graduate medical education program receive an 
additional payment to reflect the higher indirect operating 
costs associated with graduate medical education. The 
regulations regarding the calculation of this additional 
payment, known as the indirect medical education (IME) 
adjustment, are at  412.105. The additional payment is 
calculated by multiplying a hospital's DRG revenue 
(including outlier payments) by the applicable IME 
adjustment factor. The adjustment factor is calculated by 
using a hospital's ratio of residents-to-beds in the formula 
set forth at section 1886(d)(5)(B)(ii) of the Act. 

Section 412.105(b) states that the number of beds used 
in the resident-to-bed ratio is calculated by dividing the 
number of days during the cost reporting period into ``the 
number of available bed days during the cost reporting 
period, not including beds assigned to newborns, custodial 
care, and excluded distinct part hospital units * * *.'' Since 
we added this language to the regulations in the 
September 3, 1985 final rule (50 FR 35679 and 35690), there 
has been some confusion over whether this definition 
includes or excludes bed days attributable to neonatal 
intensive care units. This confusion has resulted in some 
hospitals contesting their fiscal intermediaries' inclusion 
of intensive care neonatal intensive care beds in the 
hospitals' count of available beds. 

Prior to the adoption of  412.105(b), the definition 
of available beds was at section 2510.5A of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual_Part 1, which was originally used to 
establish bed-size categories for purposes of applying the 
cost limits under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act. That 
definition excluded newborn beds but specifically included 
beds in intensive care units, coronary care units, and other 
special care inpatient hospital units. This exclusion of 
newborn beds was consistent with the exclusion of newborn 
days and costs from the determination of Medicare's share of 
allowable routine service costs (see section 2202.11B of the 
Manual). If a neonatal unit qualifies as an intensive care 
unit, however, the costs of that unit are included in 
determining Medicare's costs (see section 2202.7.II.B of the 
Manual). Correspondingly, the days in a neonatal unit that 
qualifies as an intensive care unit are counted as intensive 
care type days rather than nursery days (see section 
2202.7.II.A of the Manual). Finally, section 2510.5A of the 
Manual clearly indicates that intensive care unit beds and 
special care unit beds are included in a hospital's bed 
complement. 

In the September 3, 1985 final rule, we added the 
definition of available beds to the regulations governing 
the IME adjustment (then  412.118(b)). The expressed 
purpose for the change was to stop counting beds ``based upon 
the total number of beds available on the first day of the 
pertinent cost reporting period'' and to begin counting based 
on ``the number of available bed days (excluding beds 
assigned to newborns, custodial beds, and beds in excluded 
units) during the current cost reporting period divided by 
the number of days in the cost reporting period'' (50 FR 
35679). We did not change the definition of available beds. 
Our current position regarding the treatment of these beds 
is unchanged from the time when the cost limits established 
under section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act were in effect and is 
consistent with the way we treat beds in other hospital 
areas. That is, if the bed days and costs are allowable in 
the calculation of Medicare's share of inpatient costs, the 
beds within that unit are included as well. 

Some hospitals have asserted that when we excluded beds 
assigned to newborns, we changed our treatment of neonatal 
intensive care unit beds. However, we note that the term 
``newborn'' has historically been used synonymously with 
nursery. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this is the 
definition of a ``newborn inpatient day'' as a day that ``an 
infant occupies a newborn bed in the nursery'' (see section 
2815 of the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 2.) This 
definition dates back at least to 1975. If  412.105(b) was 
indeed meant to change our established policy, we would have 
referenced that intent at the time. This would have been 
necessary since neonatal intensive care costs and days were 
still included in the calculation of Medicare's costs. 
Finally, in August 1988, we issued Provider Reimbursement 
Manual Transmittal No. 345, revising section 2405.3G of the 
Manual, which provides implementing instructions for the IME 
adjustment. As part of this revision, the definition of the 
number of beds was clarified to specifically exclude beds 
``* * * assigned to newborns which are not in intensive care 
areas * * *.'' Those arguing that  412.105(b) excludes 
neonatal intensive care unit beds from the hospital bed 
count also argue that this Manual issuance is contradictory 
to the regulations. 

In order to clarify our policy, we are proposing to 
revise the regulations at  412.105(b) to exclude 
specifically only beds assigned to newborns in the nursery. 
Thus, neonatal intensive care beds would not be excluded 
from the bed count. We would like to stress that this does 
not represent a policy change in our bed counting rules, but 
rather a reaffirmation of our longstanding position. 
Revising the wording of the regulations should alleviate any 
future misunderstandings, as well as clarify our position 
regarding previous application of this policy, both before 
and since the original publication of our bed counting 
regulations now specified at  412.105(b). 

We are also proposing to make a technical change to 
 412.105(d)(1) to correct a reference.

G. Disproportionate Share Adjustment ( 412.106) 


Section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act provides for 
additional Medicare payments for hospitals that serve a 
disproportionate share of low income patients. Section 
1886(d)(5)(F)(vii) of the Act, as added by section 
6003(c)(1)(B) of Public Law 101-239 and amended by section 
4002(b)(1) of Public Law 101-508, specifies the formula for 
determining the disproportionate share adjustment percentage 
for hospitals that are located in an urban area and have 100 
or more beds, or are located in a rural area and have 500 or 
more beds. The statute establishes different payment 
formulas for different years, including a change in the 
formula for discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 1994. 
Regulations concerning the Medicare disproportionate 
share adjustment are set forth at  412.106. Under 
 412.106(c)(1)(i), a hospital that is located in an urban 
area and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area 
and has 500 or more beds, must have a ``disproportionate 
patient percentage'' of at least 15 percent to qualify for a 
disproportionate share payment adjustment. Section 
412.106(d)(2) sets forth the formulas for determining the 
disproportionate payment adjustment factors applicable to 
these two groups of hospitals. 
We are not proposing changes to any part of  412.106 
in this proposed rule. However, we wish to ensure that 
hospitals are aware of the revised payment formulas that 
will take effect in FY 1995 pursuant to the statute. 
Specifically, for discharges occurring on or after 
October 1, 1994, any such hospital with a disproportionate 
share patient percentage greater than 20.2 percent will 
receive a disproportionate share adjustment equal to 
5.88 percent plus 82.5 percent of the difference between 
20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate share 
patient percentage. 


H. Changes Affecting Essential Access Community Hospitals 
(EACHs) and Rural Primary Care Hospitals (RPCHs) 
(  412.109, 485.602, 485.635, and 489.102) 


On May 26, 1993, we published a final rule to implement 
the EACH program (58 FR 30630). The rule set forth the 
requirements for designating certain hospitals as EACHs or 
RPCHs, the conditions that an RPCH must meet to participate 
in Medicare, and the rules for Medicare payment for services 
furnished by EACHs and RPCHs. The final rule implemented 
section 1820 of the Act, as added by sections 6003(g) and 
6116(b)(2) of Public Law 101-239 and revised by section 
4008(d) of Public Law 101-508. The amendments were intended 
to promote regionalization of rural health services in grant 
States, improve access to hospital and other health services 
for rural residents, and enhance the provision of emergency 
and other transportation services related to health care. 
Since the publication of that rule, we have identified 
several necessary additions to the EACH/RPCH provisions. 
First, to provide for orderly review and adjudication of 
disagreements about whether a facility's designation has 
been terminated properly, we propose to specify under new 
 412.109(e) that a determination by HCFA that a hospital 
does not meet the criteria for EACH designation, or that a 
hospital's EACH designation should be terminated, is subject 
to review under 42 CFR part 405, subpart R. 
We also propose several clarifying changes to the 
definition of ``direct services'' at  485.602, as well as 
clarifying references in  485.635, the condition of 
participation on provision of services. These revisions 
merely would restate more clearly our existing policies 
under which the services listed in  485.635(b) (``direct 
services'') must be furnished by employed staff, not under 
agreements or arrangements. 
In addition, we are proposing to revise the range of 
laboratory services that an RPCH must furnish as direct 
services. In a final rule with comment period published on 
December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63533), we revised the RHC 
regulations at  491.9 to eliminate, as required direct 
services, tests not classified as waived under the Clinical 
Laboratories Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA). (See 42 CFR 
493.15.) We made these changes in the RHC regulations 
because the CLIA program introduced participation 
requirements that may cause some RHCs to withdraw from the 
program, creating a shortage of available medical care in 
some areas. 
Because RPCHs typically are located in rural areas 
similar to those served by RHCs and serve similar patient 
populations, and because the RPCH designation criteria in 
section 1820(f)(1)(H) of the Act state that RPCHs must meet 
the requirement for direct provision of routine diagnostic 
services in the statutory definition of ``rural health 
clinic,'' we believe it is appropriate to impose the same 
requirements in both settings. Therefore, we propose to 
revise the RPCH regulations at  485.635 to require the RHCs 
to provide directly the following laboratory services: 
(1) Chemical examination of urine by stick or tablet 
method or both (including urine ketones); 
(2) Hemoglobin or hematocrit; 
(3) Blood glucose; 
(4) Examination of stool specimens for occult blood; 
(5) Pregnancy tests; and

<TEXT>
 

(6) Primary culturing for transmittal to a certified 
laboratory. 
We note that this change would not prevent any RPCH 
from providing tests that are not listed in  485.635(b)(2). 
An RPCH is free to choose a higher level CLIA certification 
than the certificate of waiver if it wishes to provide tests 
of a higher complexity and to comply with all CLIA 
requirements. 
The current regulations do not set out a clear and 
consistent position on the applicability of the advance 
directives requirement. Under the regulations in 
 485.645(b)(1), swing-bed RPCHs are required to meet a 
number of skilled nursing facility (SNF) requirements, 
including  483.10(b)(4). That regulation requires that the 
patient be given the right to make an advance directive. 
(An advance directive is a written instruction, such as a 
living will or a durable power of attorney for health care, 
that deals with the provision of health care when the 
individual is incapacitated. See Subpart I of 42 CFR Part 
489.) Thus, the regulations apply the advance directives 
requirement to RPCH inpatients receiving a SNF level of care 
in swing beds, but not to inpatients receiving RPCH care. 
We believe the RPCH benefit could be administered more 
simply and equitably if both hospitals and RPCHs were 
required to comply with the same advance directives 
requirement. As explained in the preamble to the 
May 26, 1993 final rule on EACHs (58 FR 30635-30636), as 
authorized by section 1861(e) of the Act, we have read the 
word ``hospital'' to include RPCHs where the context appears 
to support such a reading. We believe the context of 
section 1866(a)(1)(Q) of the Act would support this reading, 
since many patients are likely to seek RPCH care as an 
alternative to treatment in a hospital or SNF, and many 
RPCHs will accept patients who are at risk of the kind of 
incapacitating condition addressed by an advance directive. 
Thus, we propose to revise the regulations at  489.102 to 
provide for more consistent application of the advance 
directive requirement, by specifying that it will apply to 
RPCHs on the same basis as to hospitals. 
We believe this approach is simpler to administer and 
expands beneficiary rights. Moreover, since all prospective 
RPCHs must be (or have been) hospitals and have been 
required to meet the advance directive requirement, there 
should not be any added burden. 


I. Clarification of Payment to RRC/EACH Hospitals 


We wish to clarify a response in the EACH final rule of 
May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30639-30640), regarding the effect on a 
rural referral center's (RRC) payment rate should it elect 
to become an EACH. An RRC that elects to become an EACH is 
considered to have dual classification; that is, it is 
classified as an RRC/EACH. Since section 
1886(d)(5)(D)(iii)(III) of the Act specifies that an EACH is 
to be treated as an sole community hospital (SCH), in 
determining which of the three payment rates will yield the 
highest aggregate payment, we will use the ``other'' 
standardized amount in determining the Federal payment rate 
for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. (As 
discussed above, as of that date, the other urban and rural 
payment rates will be the same.) For discharges occurring 
before October 1, 1994, the Federal payment rate is based on 
the ``other urban'' payment rate. 
Thus, an RRC that elects to become an EACH is paid 
based on whichever of the following rates yields the 
greatest aggregate payment for the cost reporting period: 
 The national Federal rate applicable to the hospital 
(that is, other urban before October 1, 1994 and ``other'' on 
or after that date); 
 The updated hospital-specific rate using FY 1982 cost 
per discharge; or 
 The updated hospital-specific rate using the FY 1987 
cost per discharge. 


J. Direct Graduate Medical Education Payment ( 413.86) 


1. Definition of Initial Residency Period 
Section 1886(h)(4) of the Act bases payment for direct 
graduate medical education (GME) costs on the hospital's 
number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents multiplied by 
a hospital-specific adjusted base year per resident amount. 
The number of FTE residents is determined by applying a 
weighting factor to each FTE resident. A resident in an 
initial residency period is weighted as 1.0 FTE. Residents 
in approved training programs that are beyond their initial 
residency period are required by law to be counted as .50 
FTE. The initial residency period is defined at 
 413.86(g)(1), as the minimum number of years of formal 
training necessary to satisfy the requirements for initial 
board eligibility in the particular specialty plus 1 year, 
not to exceed 5 years. 
Section 13563(b) of Public Law 103-66 amended section 
1886(h)(5)(F) of the Act by deleting ``plus one year'' from 
the statutory definition of initial residency period, 
effective July 1, 1995. To conform the regulations to the 
statute, we propose to revise  413.86(g)(1) by specifying 
that, effective July 1, 1995, an initial residency period is 
defined as the minimum number of years required for board 
eligibility.

<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For example, if a resident completed a 3-year internal medicine program and then started a cardiology program that
requires an additional 2 years of training, the resident would be counted as 1.0 FTE for the 3 years spent in internal
medicine and as a .50 for 2 years in the cardiology program. (Prior to Public Law 103-66, the resident would have been
counted as 1.0 FTE during the first year of the cardiology residency program.) 

2. Part-time Resident 



Currently, the last sentence of  413.86(f)(1)(ii) specifies that, for purposes of GME, ``[a] part-time resident
counts as a partial FTE based on the proportion of time worked as compared to the average time spent by other residents
working in the same specialty program.'' 

The definition of part-time resident for purposes of GME is consistent with the definition of part-time resident
for purposes of IME. However, the language in the regulations text differs and this difference has led to some confusion.
Therefore, we are proposing to revise the language at  413.86(f)(1)(ii) as follows: 

A part-time resident counts as a partial FTE based on the proportion of time worked in the hospital compared to the total
time necessary to fill a full-time internship or residency slot. 

This definition of part-time resident, for the purpose of determining GME full-time equivalent resident counts,
is consistent with the IME definition specified at  412.105(g). 

Thus, in determining the FTE count for a part-time resident, for purposes of GME, the proportion of time the resident
works in an approved program in any area of the hospital complex is compared to the total time necessary to fill a full-time
slot. 

We are also proposing to make a technical change to  412.113(b)(3) to correct a reference to  413.86. 

K. Other Technical Changes ( 412.232) 



We are republishing provisions in  412.232(c) that were inadvertently deleted from the regulations text published
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) due to an error in amendatory language in our September 1, 1992 final rule.
In order to provide the public with the complete text of the provisions of  412.232(c), pending publication
of the next edition of the CFR, we are publishing  412.232(c) in its entirety. 

V. Proposed Changes and Clarifications to the Prospective Payment System for Capital-Related Costs 

A. Evaluation of Provisions Relating to Obligated Capital for Hospitals Subject to Lengthy Certificate-of-Need
(CON) Process ( 412.302(c)(2)) 



Section 412.302(c)(2) of the regulations specifies the conditions under which capital projects may be treated as
obligated capital for hospitals subject to a lengthy CON process. Under this provision, a capital project that is
subject to a CON process may qualify as obligated capital if several conditions are met. These conditions are: 

 The hospital is required under State law to obtain prior approval of the capital project by a designated State
or local planning authority in the State in which the hospital is located; 

 The hospital filed by December 31, 1989, an initial application meeting the requirements of the State that
includes, at a minimum, a detailed description of the project and its estimated cost, and had not received approval
or disapproval by September 30, 1990; 

 The hospital expended the lesser of $750,000 or 10 percent of the estimated project cost by December 31, 1990;
and 

 The project is completed and the asset put into use for patient care on or before the earlier of September 30,
1996 or 4 years from the date CON approval is received. 

The purpose of allowing hospitals in CON states to qualify projects for recognition as obligated capital under these
special conditions was to recognize that in situations where there is a lengthy CON process, hospitals may have deferred
making the legal commitments required under the general rule for recognizing obligated capital until the CON approval
was received. We believe that such hospitals should not be disadvantaged if they reasonably anticipated the CON approval
process in their capital planning but were unable to meet the December 31, 1990 cut-off date for obligated capital
because timely approval had not been received. Our intent was not to afford more favorable treatment for these hospitals
relative to other hospitals, but rather to make a reasonable and equitable allowance for the impact a lengthy CON process
may have on the ability of hospitals that have already made a substantial financial commitment to meet the criteria
for recognition of obligated capital costs. Thus, the intent was to put these hospitals on an even footing with other
hospitals. 

Since we established this special provision in the August 30, 1991 final rule implementing the prospective payment
system for capital-related costs (56 FR 43393-43394), we have received comments from individual hospitals
and hospital associations requesting revision to the provision. With one exception, these hospitals come from a
single State and indeed most of them are located in a single large urban area of that State. Citing varied problems and
delays frequently encountered throughout the CON process, such as a requirement for separate CON approval for each
phase of a multi-phase project, the commenters have suggested that the policies be revised as follows: 

 Allow later phases of a staged construction project to be deemed part of the originally approved obligation
for purposes of meeting the December 31, 1989 deadline. 

 Extend the deadline for putting the project into use for patient care by up to 3 years. 

 Allow a 10-year transition for each phase under the hold-harmless methodology. 

We stated in our September 1, 1993 final rule that we would conduct an evaluation of the issues raised by these commenters
once we were able to obtain data on the impact of the current provision. We also noted that any reassessment of the current
provisions would be made solely within the policy framework used to establish the initial transition payment policies.
We emphasized that we would not adopt revisions that would give hospitals subject to CON processes more favorable
treatment than other hospitals.

<TEXT>
 

We now have limited, but significant, data available on the impact of the obligated capital provisions. Since the
beginning of the capital prospective payment system, the Medicare intermediaries have compiled a special data set
to monitor the implementation of the system. These intermediary data have provided us with information concerning
virtually all hospitals that have requested recognition of obligated capital and the amount, if any, of the obligated
capital approved by the intermediary. Using this data, we have been able to develop some relevant comparisons. The
data show, for example, that nationally 42.9 percent (2,281 out of 5,316) of all hospitals requested recognition
of obligated capital. A total of $21.2 billion in obligated capital has been recognized by the intermediaries. The
average amount of obligated capital recognized is $9.3 million per requesting hospital. 

Since most of the comments concerning the effects of the CON provision have come from a small group of hospitals in one
particular State with a lengthy CON process, we compared the data for that group of hospitals, and the hospitals in
that State as a whole, with the national average and the averages for similar States. We found that the group of hospitals
that has recommended revisions to the current rule had an average approved amount of obligated capital far above the
national average approved amount per requesting hospital. All of the 21 hospitals in the group in question requested
recognition of obligated capital. Furthermore, 17 of those hospitals (81 percent) received at least partial approval
of that request. The average amount of obligated capital approved was $139.5 million. Since 1 of these 21 hospitals
received approval for an extraordinarily large obligated capital project, we also computed the average amount of
obligated capital approved for the other 20 hospitals. Even excluding the hospital with the extraordinarily large
project, the average amount of obligated capital approved in the group in question is $67.5 million. This group of
21 hospitals, in fact, accounted for 13.8 percent of all the obligated capital recognized in the country (6.4 percent
for 20 hospitals, excluding the hospital with the extraordinarily large project). This group of hospitals also has
averages of obligated capital approved that are significantly above the average for the State in which they are located.
In turn, the averages for the State in which they are located are significantly higher than the averages for similar
States (that is, States with large populations, CON processes, and/or large urban areas). 

Although the fiscal intermediary data base contains data on the amount of obligated capital approved for each hospital,
it does not include data on the amount of obligated capital requested by each hospital. We are therefore unable to develop
ratios of obligated capital approved to obligated capital requested for specific hospitals and groups of hospitals
in order to determine whether that ratio is lower for this group of hospitals than the average for any regional or other
groups of hospitals. However, we believe that the large amounts of obligated capital approved for the hospitals that
have requested revision of the current rules indicate that the current rules do not disadvantage hospitals subject
to lengthy CON processes. 

In addition, our current data also cannot show how much of the obligated capital tentatively approved by the intermediaries
will eventually meet the deadlines imposed under the general rule for obligated capital and each of the special rules
for putting assets into use for patient care. Under the general rule, the asset must be put in use for patient care no
later than October 1, 1994 (which is 45 months after the latest date by which the asset must have been obligated under
the general rule). In cases of extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control, that deadline can be extended
to no later than September 30, 1996. For hospitals in CON states, the deadline for putting the asset into use for patient
care is the earlier of September 30, 1996 or 4 years from the date of CON approval ( 412.302(c)(2)(D)). 

Thus, under current regulations, hospitals that receive CON approval after September 30, 1992 may have less than
4 years to complete the project in order to meet the deadline. In the interests of maintaining an equal playing field
for those hospitals, we are proposing to change the deadline for putting assets into use for patient care to the later
of September 30, 1996 or 4 years from the date of CON approval. We believe that establishing any later deadline for hospitals
in CON states would violate the principle of equal treatment by giving those hospitals an advantage over hospitals
that must satisfy the upcoming deadline established in the general rule for obligated capital. 

On the basis of the available data, it appears that the existing CON provision has otherwise given this group of hospitals
fair access to the special protection for obligated capital. The amounts of obligated capital approved for the affected
hospitals simply do not support the need for more extensive relief to these hospitals in the context of the obligated
capital provisions. Revision of practically every element of the obligated capital provision would be required
to accommodate all the requests of the affected hospitals. Since it appears the CON rules have provided fair access
to obligated capital protections, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to propose significant changes.
We are therefore proposing no other revisions to the obligated capital rules at this time. 

However, this does not mean that revisions to other provisions of the capital prospective payment system, such as
the exceptions process, are also unwarranted. The same hospitals that have recommended changes in the obligated
capital rules have also recommended policy measures in connection with exceptions payments under the prospective
payment system for capital-related costs. Specifically, these hospitals have asked that the present 80 percent
minimum payment level for urban hospitals with at least 100 beds and a disproportionate share percentage of at least
20.2 percent be guaranteed through the rest of the transition and extended for at least 10 years after the transition.
While we do not propose to adopt those precise recommendations, we have tried to address the legitimate concerns of
these hospitals in developing the revisions which we are proposing to exceptions payment policy below in section
V.C. of this preamble.

B. Specific Adjustment for Taxes to the Capital Prospective 
Payment System Federal Rate ( 412.312) 



In the August 30, 1991 final rule implementing the capital prospective payment system, we acknowledged the need to
study whether special treatment of the property tax component of capital-related costs is appropriate (56 FR 43364-43365).
Subsequently, comments received on the May 26, 1993 proposed rule asked that we revisit this issue in a timely manner
to eliminate any inequitable payment distributions. One of the commenters also suggested a specific methodology
to adjust the capital Federal rate using a capital prospective payment system base-year survey to develop a hospital-specific
adjustment to the capital Federal rate payment. 

The Medicare cost report has recently been revised to obtain tax data directly from each hospital for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 (FY 1992). These data are just now becoming available to us. Our preliminary
review indicates a need for additional information and analysis. The FY 1992 cost report data currently available
show that with slightly less than 90 percent of all prospective payment system hospitals in the data base (only 60 percent
of which reflect audited data), only 77 percent of the proprietary hospitals reported property tax payments. This
leaves a significant number of proprietary hospitals for which no tax data have been reported. In addition, approximately
13 percent of the non-proprietary hospitals are reporting some form of payments ``in lieu of taxes.'' The nature of
the payments ``in lieu of taxes'' is not yet entirely clear. 

Given the limitations of the available data, we believe that it would be premature to develop a proposal for a property
tax adjustment. We do not believe that we should proceed with development and implementation of a property tax adjustment
until we have determined the status of the reported payments in lieu of taxes and whether an adjustment would be appropriate
for these expenses. We also need to determine why a significant number of proprietary hospitals have reported no tax
payments and what effect this might have on a budget neutrality adjustment to the Federal rate if a property tax adjustment
were adopted. We have therefore asked our regional offices to develop information on a sample of hospitals from each
group in order to refine and complete our analysis. We invite submission of relevant information and data by interested
parties and the public during the comment period to this proposed rule. 

Furthermore, although we appreciate the concern that this issue addresses, we believe that at this point the possible
adverse effects of our current policy are minimal. Capital costs represent less than 10 percent of total costs and
a proprietary hospital's average tax cost burden for assessed property represents only 7 to 9 percent of its total
capital-related costs. The tax burden for proprietary hospitals thus amounts to less than 1 percent of total costs.
In addition, for the first 5 years of the capital prospective payment system transition period, the majority of payments
to most hospitals are based on each hospital's own cost experience. Therefore, we do not believe delaying a specific
adjustment to proprietary hospitals until more data are available would cause undue hardship to the affected hospitals.


In the interim, we hope to advance the discussion of this issue by raising the issue of whether a property tax adjustment
would be appropriate and by presenting one approach to such an adjustment. We welcome comments and recommendations
on every aspect of this presentation. 

One approach to a methodology for a property tax adjustment for proprietary hospitals is to develop a property tax
factor (PTF) from data on hospital-specific tax payments in the most recently audited cost reporting year.

The PTF would take the form of a percentage add-on to the Federal rate and would remain fixed for future periods. That
is, unless a hospital had property tax costs in its most recently audited cost reporting year, it would not qualify
for an adjustment. The PTF would be based on capital cost and property tax information provided on the most current
audited cost report, as follows: 

(1) Audited cost report property tax data;
(2) Total capital cost for that year;
(3) Property tax unit cost multiplier (Line 1 divided by Line 2);
(4) Medicare inpatient capital cost;
(5) Medicare inpatient property taxes (Line 3 times Line 4);
(6) Medicare discharges;
(7) Medicare inpatient property taxes per discharge (Line 5 divided by Line 6);
(8) Federal capital rate (for fiscal year with most recent audited data);
(9) Property tax factor (Line 7 divided by Line 8).

This approach would be consistent with the philosophy of a prospective payment system. Although the initial determination
of the PTF reflects a hospital's actual tax burden in a specific year, the PTF divorces payment from subsequent changes
in the tax costs a hospital may experience. Because the PTF would be determined on the basis of tax costs from an audited
cost reporting year and computed as a constant ratio of the Federal rate, States could not use property tax changes
to capriciously increase Medicare reimbursement. Under this plan, Medicare's payment for taxes would increase
with the underlying rate of increase in the Federal rate. One objection to the PTF is that over time the ratio of actual
Medicare allowable property taxes to Medicare inpatient capital costs in a rate year could diverge from the ratio
in the year used to set the PTF. Such a divergence would create windfall gains or losses for particular hospitals, but
we know of no way to determine the magnitude of possible gains and losses to particular hospitals. The greater the magnitude
of such gains and losses, the less appropriate the PTF methodology would be. We welcome information on this issue and
recommendations about how to determine the magnitude of such gains and losses, while safeguarding the program from
arbitrary increases in hospital taxes. A related problem is that applying a constant ratio to the Federal rate has
the effect of increasing (or decreasing) the amount of the adjustment for property taxes across all hospitals by the
same factor as the increase (or decrease) to the national rate. We currently have no data that show conclusively whether
property taxes generally increase at the same rate as capital costs as a whole. This is difficult to determine since
property tax assessment systems vary enormously from one locality to another, and changes in property taxes can reflect
complicated changes in tax rates, methods of property assessment, and the tax base (that is, the percent of property
value subject to tax assessment) in different localities, as well as appreciation of existing property values. We
know of no definitive sources of information on this matter. We encourage submission of relevant information, observations,
and suggestions. An alternative methodology could employ a hospital-specific add-on amount, as opposed to the hospital-specific
ratio discussed above. Such an add-on could be determined on the basis of the base year tax costs per discharge attributable
to Medicare. This alternative may be preferable if strong evidence emerges that property taxes do not tend to increase
at the same rate as other capital costs. However, in that case, a tax increase index would need to be developed. We welcome
comments on the merits of this alternative.

We are especially interested in comments regarding an 
adjustment for non-proprietary hospitals that make payments 
in lieu of taxes and on a methodology for determining such 
an adjustment. As we previously noted, 13 percent of 
non-proprietary hospitals report payments in lieu of taxes. 
The uncertainty about the exact nature of those payments is 
one reason why we have decided to delay implementation of a 
specific property tax adjustment for those hospitals. 
However, our initial limited investigation of this issue 
suggests that those payments do not reflect assessments that 
can be categorized as capital-related costs under 
 413.130(a)(3). It appears that some non-proprietary 
hospitals may have reflected payments made for assessments 
that are not based on the valuation of the hospital's real 
or personal property. Thus, the available evidence does not 
support adoption of an adjustment for non-proprietary 
hospitals' payments in lieu of taxes. However, we will 
continue to study this matter. 

Any property tax adjustment would have to be 
implemented in a budget neutral fashion, so that total 
estimated payments under the prospective payment system for 
capital-related costs with such an adjustment would equal 
total estimated payments in the absence of a property tax 
adjustment. A property tax adjustment applied to the 
Federal rate thus requires a corresponding reduction to the 
base Federal rate to assure budget neutrality. It is 
impossible to determine the precise magnitude of the 
required adjustment to the Federal rate until we determine 
both the status of those proprietary hospitals that are not 
currently reporting taxes and the nature of the payments 
reported by non-proprietary hospitals in lieu of taxes. 
However, since our preliminary data indicates that tax 
payments by proprietary hospitals are at least 0.77 percent 
of total capital costs, we believe that a reduction to the 
base capital rate of at least 0.77 percent would be 
necessary. The final amount of the necessary adjustment to 
the Federal rate would depend upon the ultimate 
determination concerning the proprietary hospitals not 
reporting tax payments and the nature of the payments 
reported by non-proprietary hospitals. We welcome comments 
on the equity of removing tax amounts from the base Federal 
rate and distributing them only to tax-paying hospitals in 
the form of an adjustment to the Federal rate payment. Our 
concern is that special payment adjustments recognize only 
costs that are distinguishable and unique. We also wish to 
avoid granting unwarranted advantages to any particular 
class of hospitals. 

We plan to conduct further analysis on this issue prior 
to the publication of the final rule. We will also analyze 
comments and recommendations submitted in response to this 
discussion. We will make a determination concerning whether 
to adopt a property tax adjustment, and the form that any 
such adjustment would take, when we have obtained sufficient 
relevant data and have resolved all significant problems 
inherent to any adjustment methodology. 



C. Revision of Provision Relating to Exceptions Payment 
( 412.348) 



Section 412.348 provides that, during the transition 
period, a hospital may receive additional payment under an 
exceptions process when its regular payments are less than a 
minimum percentage, established by class of hospital, of the 
hospital's reasonable capital-related costs. The amount of 
the exceptions payment is the difference between the 
hospital's minimum payment level and the payments the 
hospital would receive under the capital prospective payment 
system in the absence of an exceptions payment. The 
comparison is made on a cumulative basis for all cost 
reporting periods during which the hospital is subject to 
the capital prospective payment transition rules. 

Under current  412.348(b)(1), the minimum payment 
percentages by class of hospitals for FY 1995 are:

 For sole community hospitals, 90 percent; 

 For urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that have 
a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 
20.2 percent or that received more than 30 percent of its 
net inpatient care revenues from State or local governments 
for indigent care, 80 percent; 

 For all other hospitals, 70 percent of the 
hospital's reasonable inpatient capital-related costs. 

The current regulations also provide that total 
estimated payments under the exceptions process in a year 
may not exceed 10 percent of total estimated capital 
prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments 
for old capital) for the same fiscal year. As we stated in 
the August 30, 1991 final rule, we will revise the minimum 
payment percentages during any subsequent transition year, 
if necessary, to ensure that exceptions payments do not 
exceed the 10 percent limit. It has not yet been necessary 
to reduce the original minimum payment percentages to meet 
the 10 percent limit. 

In the final rule for the prospective payment system 
for capital-related costs, we stated that we would carefully 
monitor the impact of the capital prospective payment system 
in order to determine whether ``some type of permanent 
exceptions process is necessary and the circumstances under 
which additional payments would be made (56 FR 43409).'' 
Since the publication of the final rule for the capital 
prospective payment system, several commenters have urged us 
to provide special protection for hospitals that are 
undertaking major renovation or replacement of aging 
facilities during the decade of the transition. These 
commenters have pointed out that, unlike hospitals that 
undertook major renovation or replacement during the 1980s, 
many hospitals that undertake capital replacement or 
renovation projects during the transition do not qualify for 
the protection for old capital or obligated capital during 
the transition. In addition, unlike hospitals that will 
undertake major capital replacement or renovation in the 
decade after the transition period, such hospitals have not 
had an opportunity to accrue capital prospective payments to 
fund the projects. We are aware of a number of major 
projects, scheduled for completion later in the transition, 
that could therefore not be included as old or obligated 
capital, and that involve major replacement or renovation of 
aging facilities. In the design of the capital prospective 
payment system, we have made every effort to consider the 
circumstances of hospitals for whom the transition to 
prospective payment poses special difficulties. We agree 
with the commenters that hospitals that need to undertake 
major renovation or replacement projects during the 
transition face special difficulties merely because of the 
timing of their projects. We do not believe that the 
Medicare program should guarantee to underwrite every major 
program of replacement or renovation of capital assets. 
However, under certain circumstances we believe that it is 
fair to provide special protection, through the exceptions 
process, for hospitals that find themselves in the 
circumstances cited. 

In addition to the exceptions categories identified 
above, we are therefore proposing at  412.348 to provide 
special protection for some hospitals that are undertaking 
major projects to renovate or replace aging plant during the 
transition period. This special protection, which will 
provide a 70 percent minimum payment level for up to ten 
years beyond the transition period, will be available only 
to the following classes of hospitals: 

 Sole community hospitals that have a current ratio 
less than or equal to of 1.75 in the exception year; 

 Urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that either 
have disproportionate share percentages of at least 20.2 
percent or receive at least 30 percent of their revenue from 
State or local funds for indigent care, and that have a 
current ratio less than or equal to 1.75 in the exception 
year; and 

 Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and 
Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent. 
In addition, the hospital must meet an age of asset test 
and, if applicable, receive approval for the project from a 
State or local planning authority. If planning approval is 
not required, an urban hospital must demonstrate either that 
it is in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) that does not 
have an overall average occupancy rate less than 80 percent 
or that its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior 
capacity (in terms of bed size). 

We believe that this exception should apply only to 
hospitals that have previously been identified for special 
protection under the Medicare program (that is, sole 
community hospitals or large urban hospitals that serve 
disproportionate shares of indigent patients), or that have 
heavy utilization by beneficiaries of the Federal health 
programs. The average hospital utilization by Medicaid 
beneficiaries is approximately 10 percent. Hospitals with 
60 percent Medicare utilization can reasonably claim high 
Medicare utilization rates. We have therefore determined 
that, aside from certain sole community hospitals and large 
urban disproportionate share hospitals, this special 
exception should be restricted to hospitals with combined 
Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent. 

We are also requiring that sole community hospitals and 
large urban disproportionate share hospitals must have 
current ratios of less than or equal to 1.75 in order to be 
eligible for this special exception. We do not believe that 
hospitals that do not have high Medicare and Medicaid 
utilization should be eligible for this special exception 
unless they are financially vulnerable. The current ratio 
is perhaps the most widely used measure of hospital 
liquidity. It is defined as the number of dollars held in 
current assets per dollar of current liabilities. Thus, 
higher values reflect a stronger short-term financial 
condition. A current ratio of 2.0 or better is a common 
hospital target for financial performance. We therefore 
believe that a current ratio of less than or equal to 1.75 
is a sufficient indication of financial stress to qualify 
for special protection under the exceptions policy. The 
current ratio can be determined from information available 
on the Medicare cost report (HCFA 2552-92, Worksheet G, 
Lines 11 and 43).

One concern that we have about the use of the current 
ratio as a measure is that it may be possible for hospitals 
to manipulate cost report statistics to meet a current ratio 
threshold. Some analysis suggests that the current ratio 
should be supplemented by measures such as days in accounts 
receivable and/or days in accounts payable in order to 
reduce the prospects for manipulation. We will continue to 
study this issue before publication of a final rule on this 
special exceptions provision. We welcome comments on the 
use of the current ratio as a measure of hospital financial 
vulnerability, on the appropriate threshold under this 
measure, and on whether the current ratio should be 
supplemented by other measures. 
An eligible hospital must pass an age of asset test in 
order to qualify for an exception. Hospitals almost 
universally have plant and equipment of varying ages. The 
average age of a hospital's assets is commonly determined as 
the ratio of accumulated depreciation to current 
depreciation expense. The current version of the Medicare 
cost report (HCFA 2552-92) allows for determination of 
average age of assets for all hospital assets, for building 
and fixed equipment alone, or for moveable equipment alone. 
The average age of buildings and fixed equipment can be 
determined on the basis of information on the current 
Medicare cost report (HCFA 2552-92, Worksheet G, Lines 14, 
14.01, 16, 16.01, 18, 18.01, 20, and 20.01, and Worksheet A-7, Part III, Column 9, Lines 1 and 3). 
We propose a two-part age of asset test to identify 
aging hospitals that undertake needed major capital 
replacement or renovation projects during the transition. 
The test would only consider changes in the average age of 
building and fixed equipment (determined by the ratio of 
accumulated depreciation for building and fixed equipment to 
current depreciation for building and fixed equipment) in 
order to focus on major capital replacement and renovation 
projects. We believe that it is appropriate to grant 
exceptions only to aging hospitals that undertake and 
complete major capital projects during the capital 
prospective payment transition period. 
The first part of the age-of-asset test is designed to 
determine whether a hospital had relatively aged fixed 
assets at the beginning of the capital transition period 
(that is, the hospital's first cost reporting period 
beginning on or after October 1, 1991). We would determine 
a hospital's average age of building and fixed equipment 
using cost report data for the first year of the transition 
in comparison to the national average age of buildings and 
fixed equipment for that year. The threshold for qualifying 
under this part of the test would be the 75th percentile. 
We do not believe that the special protection we are 
proposing under this provision should be extended to 
hospitals who cannot demonstrate an urgent need for 
replacement or renovation of facilities. We believe that an 
average age of assets at or above the 75th percentile 
nationally is a sufficient indicator that a hospital had a 
pressing need for renovation or replacement at the beginning 
of the capital transition period to serve as a threshold 
qualifier for a special exception. 
We would determine whether a hospital is at or above 
the 75th percentile nationally on the basis of Medicare cost 
report data for FY 1992. That data is becoming available 
this year. Preliminary but incomplete data suggest that the 
average age of buildings and fixed equipment at the 75th 
percentile is approximately 16.4 years. We intend to make a 
final determination on the basis of more complete data that 
will become available at a later date. 
The second part of the test would compare the average 
age of buildings and fixed equipment in the cost reporting 
period beginning in FY 1992 with the average age of fixed 
assets in the year the hospital reports the completion of a 
major capital replacement or renovation. A major renovation 
or replacement of hospital capital during the transition 
period should result in a dramatically reduced average age 
of buildings and fixed equipment compared to the first year 
of the transition. We are therefore proposing that the test 
would be whether a hospital's average age of buildings and 
fixed equipment has declined by at least 50 percent since 
the first year of payment under the capital prospective 
payment system. Thus, a hospital whose average age of 
buildings and fixed equipment is at or above the 75th 
percentile nationally in the first year of capital 
prospective payment, and whose average age of buildings and 
fixed equipment has declined by at least 50 percent in a 
designated year later in the transition, meets the age-of-assets test. 
We welcome comment on the use of an average age of 
asset measure, on the age-of-assets test as we have 
conceived it, and on the appropriate threshold levels to 
apply under such a test.

We do not believe that this special exception for 
replacement and renovation of old facilities should apply to 
hospitals whose capital projects preserve the overcapacity 
that is currently evident in much of the hospital industry. 
Therefore, a hospital cannot qualify for an exception unless 
it has received any required approval from a State or local 
planning authority. If such approval is not required, an 
urban hospital must demonstrate either that (1) overall 
average occupancy in its MSA is at least 80 percent, or (2) 
its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior 
capacity (in terms of bed size). We are exempting rural 
hospitals from this requirement because of concern about 
maintaining access to needed services in rural areas. 
Hospitals that qualify for exceptions under this 
special provision may continue to receive exceptions 
payments for up to 10 years beyond the transition. 
Exceptions payments will be available to hospitals that meet 
the special criteria above for 10 years after the date when 
the hospital meets the age of asset test, provided that the 
hospital meets the age of asset test no later than the end 
of the capital prospective payment system transition period 
for the hospital (that is, the last day of the hospital's 
last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 
2001). We believe that extending exceptions payments for up 
to 10 years after the transition should be sufficient for 
hospitals who must undertake major renovation or replacement 
of facilities during the transition period. 
We would continue to determine the amount of the 
exceptions payments under this special provision on a 
cumulative basis. That is, we would determine the 
hospital's exception payment by comparing the cumulative 
payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective 
payments system to the cumulative minimum payment levels 
applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period 
subject to the prospective payment system. Any amount by 
which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its 
cumulative minimum payment levels would continue to be 
deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be 
payable for the cost reporting period. In addition, we will 
apply another test designed to limit the amount of 
exceptions payments under this special provision. We would 
reduce the amount of an exception payment that would 
otherwise be made for any cost reporting period under this 
special provision by the amount of any Medicare hospital 
inpatient prospective payment system payments for the cost 
reporting period (less 75 percent of operating prospective 
payment system disproportionate share payments if 
applicable) that are in excess of Medicare inpatient 
operating and capital costs. This calculation includes 
payments under both the capital and operating prospective 
payment systems. It does not include graduate medical 
education payments, outpatient service payments, or payments 
for any other services covered under Medicare Part B. We 
propose to exclude 75 percent of operating prospective 
payment system disproportionate share payments from the 
determination of the Medicare operating prospective payments 
system payments in order to account for the financial 
pressure that disproportionate share hospitals experience in 
other parts of their operations. 
Finally, we emphasize that these proposed policies 
would be subject to reevaluation in the light of passage of 
comprehensive health care reform by Congress. The hospitals 
for whom we currently propose to provide special protections 
may no longer require such protections after the 
implementation of comprehensive health care financing 
reform. Therefore, we will carefully monitor the impact of 
final health care reform legislation on the hospitals that 
would receive special treatment under the policies proposed 
above to determine whether such legislation justifies 
revision of those policies. 
We are proposing the following revisions to the 
regulations text to implement the changes discussed above: 
 Under new  412.348(a), we would define current 
ratio, fixed assets, and average age of fixed assets. 
 The new special exceptions requirements are set 
forth at proposed  412.348(g). 
 Current paragraphs (a) through (e) have been 
redesignated as paragraphs (b) through (f), and current 
paragraph (f) has been redesignated as paragraph (h). 
 We are also proposing to make conforming technical 
changes to  412.348 to correct references.

D. Extraordinary Circumstances Exceptions Payments 
( 412.348(e)) 


Currently,  412.348(e) provides that a hospital may 
request an additional payment during the capital transition 
period if the hospital incurs an unanticipated capital 
expenditure in excess of $5 million (net of insurance 
proceeds) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the 
hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include but 
are not limited to a flood, fire, or earthquake. A hospital 
must apply to the HCFA regional office, for a determination 
by the HCFA Administrator, within 180 days of the 
extraordinary circumstance that caused the unexpected 
expenditures in order to qualify for exceptions payments. 
We propose to revise  412.348 to clarify our policy and 
reconcile conflicts between the regulation text and the 
language and intent of the preamble to the August 30, 1991 
final rule that implemented prospective payment system for 
capital-related costs (56 FR 43411). 
With respect to current  412.348(e)(1), we intend to 
clarify that the minimum expenditure criteria that the 
hospital must meet in order to qualify for payments is the 
net amount of proceeds expected to be recovered by the 
hospital in connection with the event from any other source 
including, but not limited to, insurance, litigation, or 
other government relief funding. In the August 30, 1991 
final rule, in response to a comment concerning the 
exceptions process, we indicated that we intended to provide 
for an additional payment when a hospital has extraordinary 
circumstances that result in unanticipated capital spending 
of at least $5 million. We then stated that in determining 
whether this threshold was met, we would take into account 
any insurance proceeds received by the hospital in 
connection with the extraordinary circumstances. However, 
we inadvertently failed to list other sources that may 
reduce the unanticipated capital-related expense to the 
hospital. Later in that response we noted that HCFA's 
decision will be contingent on a final determination of the 
associated costs for the unanticipated circumstance and we 
provided an example of how the extraordinary circumstance 
exception policy would be applied. In that example we noted 
that the hospital must provide evidence of the extent to 
which the loss will be covered by insurance proceeds or 
other sources. In the regulations text, we reflected our 
intention to establish the threshold net of insurance but 
did not include the other comparable sources, such as court 
awards for damages, or other governmental relief funds. 
The purpose of establishing this exception was to 
protect hospitals during the transition period from out-of-pocket expenditures at a level that could put severe

financial strain on them. Thus, we clearly did not intend 
to replace or supplement other payment sources that have an 
obligation to pay or provide special authorization for 
funding in these same circumstances. As a result, we intend 
to revise current  412.348(e)(1) to conform with the 
example provided in the August 30, 1991 final rule 
concerning application of the extraordinary circumstances 
exception policy and, specifically, documentation of 
evidence of the extent of net loss. 
We also propose to correct the provision in current 
 412.348(e)(2) regarding the level at which the 
determination of a hospital's eligibility for an 
extraordinary circumstance exception payment is made. 
Although the determination authority was reserved to the 
HCFA Administrator, we believe that the appropriate official 
to make this decision is the Director of the Office of 
Payment Policy, Bureau of Policy Development, Health Care 
Financing Administration. This change is warranted because 
it is inappropriate that the HCFA Administrator make a 
decision that he or she may be called on to review if a 
hospital requests an administrative appeal of an adverse 
decision on its exceptions application. As the director of 
the HCFA component that determines policy on hospital 
payment in general and exceptions payment policy in 
particular, the Director of the Office of Payment Policy is 
ideally suited to make the determination on an exceptions 
request. The determination is subject to the appeal 
procedures of subpart R of 42 CFR part 405 when the provider 
receives the NPR for the cost reporting period for which the 
provider is seeking additional payments. 


E. Funding of Depreciation (  413.134 and 413.153) 


Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act gives the Secretary 
broad latitude to prescribe regulations concerning Medicare 
payments to providers on a reasonable cost basis. Under 
this authority,  413.134(e) provides that, although we do 
not require the funding of depreciation, we strongly 
recommend it as a means of conserving funds for the 
replacement of depreciable assets. 


1. Offset of Investment Income 


To encourage the funding of depreciation, we have 
specified at   413.134(e)(1) and 413.153(b)(2)(iii) that 
investment income earned on funded depreciation will not be 
used to reduce allowable interest expense. Further, 
 413.134(e) stipulates that additions to the funded 
depreciation account must remain in the account for at least 
6 months to be considered valid funding transactions and be 
eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account.

In response to a comment in the August 30, 1991 final rule 
on the prospective payment system for inpatient hospital 
capital-related costs (56 FR 43424), we stated that interest 
on any funds that do not qualify as funded depreciation 
account funds, which would include funded depreciation 
deposits of less than 6 months duration, must be used to 
offset interest expense. Section 226.3 of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual (HCFA Pub. 15-1) provides that 
investment income earned prior to the elapse of the 6-month 
period will not be offset unless the deposits are actually 
withdrawn during this period. 
We are proposing to revise  413.134(e)(1) to state 
specifically that investment income earned during the 
6-month period will not be used to offset interest expense 
unless the funds are withdrawn for an improper purpose 
during this period. Under this change, if a provider 
withdraws funds from the funded depreciation account before 
the expiration of the 6-month time limit, and the withdrawal 
is made for an allowable purpose as described in 
 413.134(e)(3)(i)(A), the investment income earned on the 
funds is not offset against allowable interest expense. 


2. Loans to the General Fund 


We propose to revise and clarify our policy regarding 
loans from the provider's funded depreciation fund to the 
provider's general fund. Sections 413.153(b)(3)(ii) and 
(c)(2) permit a provider to lend its funded depreciation 
funds to its general fund. Moreover, these sections provide 
that interest expense incurred on such loans are considered 
allowable costs. Section 226.1 of the Manual amplifies this 
policy by explaining that, in order for the interest expense 
incurred on such loans to be allowable, the interest expense 
must meet the ``necessary and proper'' tests (set forth in the 
regulations at  413.153(b) (2) and (3), and in the Manual at 
sections 202.2 and 202.3). This section of the Manual also 
explains that the funds loaned to the general fund must not 
be used to acquire depreciable assets used to furnish 
patient care because the provider is expected to use its 
funded depreciation, rather than to lend it, for that 
purpose. Finally, this section of the Manual explains that 
deposits to the funded depreciation fund will not be 
recognized to the extent that loans of funded depreciation 
funds to the general fund are outstanding. Rather, such 
deposits will be considered repayments of the loan to the 
general fund. 
Three other sections of the Manual address loans from a 
provider's funded depreciation fund to the provider's 
general fund. Section 226.C of the Manual, in discussing 
the availability of funded depreciation funds, provides that 
loans made from funded depreciation do not alter the 
requirement that funded depreciation must be available for 
the acquisition of the provider's depreciable assets used to 
furnish patient care, or for other capital purposes related 
to patient care. Section 226.3 of the Manual, in discussing 
the application of the 6-month rule for a deposit to become 
a valid funding transaction, provides that a loan of funded 
depreciation funds to the general fund is considered a 
withdrawal for purposes of applying the 6-month rule. That 
is, if the provider borrows from funded depreciation for a 
working capital purpose, and some or all of the funds 
borrowed were not on deposit in the funded depreciation fund 
for at least 6 months, the borrowing would be considered a 
withdrawal from the funded depreciation account. In 
addition, if a deposit did not satisfy the 6-month rule any 
investment income earned on the deposit would have to be 
used to offset otherwise allowable interest expense. 
Section 226.4B of the Manual, in an example of applying of 
the last-in, first-out basis to withdrawals from funded 
depreciation for an improper purpose, also characterizes a 
loan to the general fund from the funded depreciation fund 
as a withdrawal. 
In recent years, we have received a number of inquiries 
suggesting that loans from the provider's funded 
depreciation fund to the provider's general fund are 
characterized more appropriately as investments of funded 
depreciation, rather than withdrawals. We agree with the 
inquirers. The term ``withdrawal'' implies that the funds 
have been removed from the funded depreciation account and 
used, either for a proper purpose (for example, acquisition 
of a depreciable asset) or an improper purpose (for example, 
to purchase office supplies). In contrast, the term 
``investment'' implies that the funds have not actually been 
removed from the funded depreciation account and used; 
rather, they have been temporarily converted to one or more 
income producing vehicles (for example, the purchase of U.S. 
Treasury bills). Because loans from the funded depreciation 
funds to the general fund generate investment income for the 
funded depreciation fund, we believe that such loans more 
properly should be considered as investments, rather than 
withdrawals. 
In conjunction with this change, we had to decide 
whether such loans would have to meet the ``readily 
marketable'' test for allowable funded depreciation 
investments expressed in  413.134(e) and section 226 of the 
Manual. We believe that, because we require that loans made 
from funded depreciation do not alter the requirement that 
the funded depreciation be available for the acquisition of 
depreciable assets used to furnish patient care, or for 
other capital purposes related to patient care, application 
of the ``readily marketable'' test would be redundant. That 
is, if a provider loans funded depreciation to the general 
fund, and while that loan is outstanding the provider needs 
funds to acquire a depreciable asset related to patient 
care, the provider may not borrow funds to acquire the 
depreciable asset. Rather, the provider must recall the 
funds from the general fund loan to use to acquire the 
asset. 
Accordingly, we propose to add paragraph (e)(4) to 
 413.134 to address loans from the funded depreciation 
account. New  413.134(e)(4) would both consolidate the 
policies now set forth in the manual sections cited above 
and revise our policy regarding the characterization of 
loans from the funded depreciation account. Such loans 
would be considered investments, rather than withdrawals.

3. Spenddown of ``Tainted'' Funded Depreciation 


The preamble to the August 30, 1991 final rule also 
addressed the issue of spenddown (56 FR 43421). ``Spenddown'' 
is a process whereby we permit providers to ``cure'' borrowing 
that was found to be unnecessary because of available funded 
depreciation by using those funded depreciation funds for a 
proper purpose. Under spenddown, if additional deposits are 
made to funded depreciation after the unnecessary borrowing 
determination, withdrawals from the funded depreciation 
subsequent to a determination of unnecessary borrowing are 
made on a last-in, first-out basis (typically, withdrawals 
for a proper purpose are made on a first-in, first-out 
basis). The result of this policy is that all additional 
deposits to funded depreciation must be used before spending 
can be allotted to the ``tainted'' funds, that is, the portion 
of the funded depreciation that resulted in the unnecessary 
borrowing. In addition, Medicare's policy has been that any 
other funded depreciation funds in the account at the time 
of the unnecessary borrowing must be used before the 
``tainted'' funds can be spent down or cured. 
Since the publication of the August 30, 1991 final 
rule, we have received several inquiries asking why our 
policy on spenddown was not incorporated into the 
regulations. These inquiries also have pointed out that the 
last-in, first-out method set forth at  413.134(e)(3)(i)(C) 
will not work properly when the unnecessary borrowing is 
repaid from the funded depreciation account and that account 
contained untainted funded depreciation at the time of the 
unnecessary borrowing or received additional deposits after 
the borrowing. The inquirers suggested that this situation 
may be rectified by establishing an exception to the 
last-in, first-out rule when the unnecessary borrowing that 
caused the ``tainting'' is repaid out of funded depreciation. 
In this case, any use of funded depreciation to repay the 
unnecessary borrowing will be deemed to be from ``tainted'' 
funded depreciation. We agree and propose to provide for 
such an exception in  413.134(e)(2)(iv). 
Similarly, where the provider repays part or all of the 
principal of the unnecessary borrowing that caused the 
``tainted'' funded depreciation by using general funds, a 
corresponding amount of the ``tainted'' funded depreciation 
must be cured. This is necessary so that the ``tainted'' 
portion of the funded depreciation does not exceed the 
amount of the balance of the unnecessary borrowing that 
caused the ``tainting'' in the first place. 
We are proposing to revise  413.134(e) to incorporate 
the curing process of ``tainted'' funded depreciation and also 
to provide that the provider's subsequent repayment of the 
principal portion of the unnecessary borrowing will be from 
the ``tainted'' funds in the funded depreciation. Thus, 
neither the first-in, first-out nor the last-in, first-out 
basis would be applicable for such repayments. 


4. Necessary and Unnecessary Borrowing 


In February 1977, HCFA published  203 of the Provider 
Reimbursement Manual to address interest on loans in excess 
of asset value acquired after 1970. Section 203.D of the 
Manual states that ``[r]epayments of the funds borrowed are 
applied first to reducing the portion of the loan applied to 
the allowable cost of the patient care assets, then to the 
tangible and intangible assets not considered reasonably 
related to patient care, and lastly to goodwill.'' We have 
applied this long-standing principle to cases where a 
provider repays borrowed funds where some of these funds are 
deemed to be unnecessary. In these circumstances, we have 
held that all of necessary borrowing must be repaid before 
any of the repayments may be applied to the unnecessary 
borrowing. 
We also apply this principle to unnecessary borrowing 
that causes ``tainted'' funded depreciation. When a portion 
of a provider's borrowing is considered unnecessary because 
of the availability of funded depreciation, subsequent 
repayments, whether from funded depreciation or general 
funds, are first applied to the allowable portion of the 
borrowing and, when all of the allowable borrowing is 
repaid, to the unallowable portion of the loan. This places 
the provider in the same position as if the available funded 
depreciation had been used without any unnecessary 
borrowing.

These applications have not been clearly set forth in 
the regulations. Therefore, we propose to revise 
  413.134(e) and 413.153(d) to clearly address both 
situations. 
We are also proposing to make a technical change to 
 413.134(d)(1) to correct a reference. 


VI. Proposed Changes for Hospitals Excluded From the 
Prospective Payment Systems 


A. New Requirements for Certain Long-Term Care Hospitals 
Excluded From the Prospective Payment Systems ( 412.23) 


Section 1861(e) of the Act and the regulations at 42 
CFR part 482 define a hospital as an institution that 
qualifies to participate in Medicare because it meets 
certain health and safety standards, known as ``conditions of 
participation'' (COPs). A hospital must be surveyed for 
compliance with the COPs by State agencies that work under 
agreement with HCFA unless, under section 1865 of the Act 
and regulations at 42 CFR part 488, the hospital is presumed 
to meet the COPs on the basis of accreditation by the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or 
the American Osteopathic Association. 
Recently, some entities have discovered that the 
process for becoming a provider under the COPs can be 
manipulated to permit them to receive exclusion from the 
prospective payment systems. Specifically, hospitals have 
begun to organize themselves under what they themselves 
refer to as the ``hospital within a hospital'' model. Under 
this model, an entity may operate in space leased from a 
hospital, and have most or all services furnished under 
arrangements by employees of the lessor hospital. The newly 
organized entity may be operated by a corporation formed and 
controlled by the lessor hospital, or by a third entity that 
controls both. In either case, the new entity seeks State 
licensure and Medicare participation as a hospital, 
demonstrates that it has an average length of stay of over 
25 days, and obtains an exclusion from the prospective 
payment systems. The effect of this process is to extend 
the long-term care hospital exclusion to what is for all 
practical purposes a long-term care hospital unit. 
We believe it may not be appropriate for a long-term 
care ``hospital within a hospital'' to receive an exclusion 
from the prospective payment systems. The considerations 
underlying exclusions from the prospective payment systems 
may not apply to these entities. 
Under the prospective payment systems, hospitals are 
paid for inpatient services on the basis of prospectively 
determined rates. Under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, 
certain hospitals and units are excluded from the 
prospective payment systems including, psychiatric, 
rehabilitation, children's, and long-term care hospitals, 
and psychiatric and rehabilitation units. These hospitals 
and units are excluded because they could not be paid 
appropriately under the prospective payment systems. The 
statute does not exclude ``long-term care units'' of general 
hospitals. 
The prospective payment systems are based on an 
averaging concept which recognizes that some patients will 
stay longer and consume more resources than expected, while 
others will have shorter, less costly stays. We expect that 
an efficiently operated hospital will be able to deliver 
quality care to Medicare patients at an aggregate cost no 
greater than its aggregate Medicare payments under the 
prospective payment systems for each cost reporting period. 
The DRG system does not, however, apply well to 
long-stay hospitals. Those hospitals have few short-stay or 
low-cost cases, and might be systematically underpaid if the 
prospective payment method applied. Thus, exclusion of 
entire long-term care hospitals from the prospective payment 
systems is appropriate. However, if an entity that provides 
long-term care is part of a larger hospital, the reasons for 
exclusion may not apply. A long-term care ``hospital within 
a hospital'' is essentially a long-term care hospital unit 
which accounts for only a part of the larger hospital's 
patient load. The principles underlying the prospective 
payment systems do apply to the larger hospital, unlike 
entire long-term care hospitals. Exclusion of long-term 
care units could inadvertently encourage hospitals to try to 
abuse the prospective payment systems, by diverting all 
long-stay cases to the excluded unit, leaving only the 
shorter, less costly cases to be paid for under the 
prospective payment systems. In such cases, hospitals would 
profit inappropriately from prospective payments. 
For these reasons, we believe it may be inappropriate 
to grant an exclusion to a long-term care ``hospital within a 
hospital.'' Moreover, exclusion of long-term care ``units'' is 
inconsistent with the statutory scheme. Section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act clearly provides for exclusions 
from the prospective payment systems for long-term care 
hospitals, and also for psychiatric units and rehabilitation 
units, but the statute does not provide for exclusion of 
long-term care units. Also, we note that section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act begins with the phrase ``as used in 
this section'' in referring to hospitals; we believe this 
language suggests that the definition of ``hospital'' for 
prospective payment purposes may be different from other 
definitions. Furthermore, section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act 
provides that excluded from the definition of prospective 
payment systems hospital is a psychiatric or rehabilitation 
unit of a hospital that is a distinct part of the hospital 
``as defined by the Secretary.'' 
We believe these distinctions were intended to be 
meaningful, and that it would undermine the distinctions if 
we allowed exclusion of long-term care units. Because we 
believe such exclusions are contrary to the purpose and 
scheme of section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we are proposing 
to revise the regulations to prevent inappropriate 
exclusions. Section 1871 of the Act provides that the 
Secretary ``shall prescribe such regulations as may be 
necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance 
programs under this title,'' and section 1102 of the Act 
authorizes the Secretary to ``make and publish such rules and 
regulations * * * as may be necessary to the efficient 
administration of the functions with which [the Secretary] 
is charged under this Act.''

To avoid recognizing nominal hospitals, while allowing adequate flexibility for legitimate networking and sharing
of services, we are proposing additional criteria in 42 CFR part 412, subpart B for determining whether an entity qualifies
for exclusion from the prospective payment systems 
as a separate long-term care hospital. These criteria would be applied to entities seeking exclusion from the prospective
payment systems as a long-term care hospital. The revised criteria would apply to entities seeking exclusion as a
long-term care hospital for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, including reapprovals
of long-term care exclusions for entities that are currently excluded. 

We propose that in addition to meeting any of the classification requirements set forth in  412.23, for cost
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, to be excluded from the prospective payment systems, a hospital
located in the same building or in one or more entire buildings located on the same campus as another hospital and seeking
long-term care exclusion must meet the following requirements: 

 

Separate governing body.

 The hospital has a governing body that is separate from the governing body of the hospital from which it obtains space.
The hospital's governing body is not under the control of the hospital that 
provides space, or of any third entity that controls both hospitals. 

 

Separate chief medical officer.

 The hospital has a single chief medical officer who reports directly to the governing body and who is responsible for
all medical staff activities of the hospital. The chief medical officer of the hospital is not employed by or under
contract with either the hospital that provides space or any third entity that controls both hospitals. 

 

Separate medical staff.

 The hospital has a medical staff that is separate from the medical staff of the hospital from which it obtains space.
The hospital's medical staff is directly accountable to the governing body 
for the quality of medical care provided in the hospital, and adopts and enforces bylaws governing medical staff activities,
including criteria and procedures for recommending to the governing body the privileges to be granted to individual
practitioners. 

 

Chief executive officer.

 The hospital has a single chief executive officer through whom all administrative authority flows, and who exercises
control and surveillance over all administrative activities of the hospital. The chief executive officer is not
employed by, or under contract with, either the hospital that provides space or any third entity that controls both
hospitals. 

 

Performance of basic hospital functions.

 The hospital performs the basic hospital functions specified in   482.21 through 482.27, 482.30, and
482.42 through the use of employees or under contracts or other agreements with entities other than the hospital from
which it obtains space, or a third entity that controls both hospitals. Food and dietetic services and housekeeping,
maintenance, and other services necessary to maintain a clean and safe physical environment could be obtained under
contracts or other agreements with the hospital that provides space, or with a third entity that controls both hospitals.


For purposes of these proposals, we would consider ``control'' to exist if an individual or organization has the power,
directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.
This definition of ``control'' is now codified 
in the regulations at  413.17(b)(3), concerning allowable Medicare costs, and we would apply the same criteria
to determine whether hospitals and hospital units should be excluded from the prospective payment systems. Thus,
most 
hospital managers and administrators are familiar with this definition. We welcome comments on this and other issues
concerning the proposed exclusion criteria. 

Finally, to ensure that hospitals that are excluded from the prospective payment systems are not confused with the
types of facilities that can participate separately in Medicare as distinct-part psychiatric hospitals or skilled
nursing facilities, we propose to delete all references in the current prospective payment systems regulations
to excluded units as ``distinct part'' facilities.

B. Removal of the 1986 Malpractice Rule ( 413.56) 



We propose removing from the regulations ``the 1986 malpractice rule'', which is set forth at  413.56. We also
would remove all cross-references to  413.56. This proposal is a technical change designed to conform the 
regulations to the various authorities that have previously established that the 1986 malpractice rule is invalid.


The history of Medicare reimbursement policy under the cost-based reimbursement system for provider malpractice
insurance costs is described in detail in Sections I. and II.A. of the March 27, 1987 final rule (52 FR 9833). To summarize
briefly: for cost reporting periods beginning before July 1, 1979, provider malpractice insurance costs were included
in the general and administrative cost center (``G & A pool'') with other overhead costs, and apportioned to the
Medicare program in accordance with the provider's 
Medicare utilization rate (52 FR 9834). (See also  405.452(b)(1) (``the pre-1979 utilization method) redesignated
at  413.53(a)(1)(i).) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1979, ``the 1979 malpractice
rule'' removed provider malpractice insurance costs from the G & A pool, and directly apportioned those insurance
costs based on the ratio of 
provider malpractice losses paid for Medicare patients compared to losses paid for all patients (52 FR 9834). On April
1, 1986, we published an interim final rule with comment period that replaced the 1979 malpractice rule, effective
May 1, 1986, with the 1986 malpractice rule (51 FR 11142). The 1986 malpractice rule was set forth in regulations at
 405.457, subsequently redesignated as  413.456, and then confirmed in our above-cited March 27, 1987
final rule. The 1986 malpractice rule reestablished reimbursement of skilled nursing facility malpractice insurance
costs under the pre-1979 utilization method,  413.56(c), whereas hospital malpractice insurance 
costs were reimbursed based on both a hospital's utilization rate and aspects of the claims-paid approach of the 1979
regulation. (See  413.56(b).) 

The Secretary's authority to apply the hospital payment provisions of the 1986 malpractice rule has been eliminated
through a series of events. As promulgated initially, the 1986 rule applied retroactively, subject to the Medicare
program's general rules of administrative finality, to cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1979.
(See  413.56(a).) Subsequently, however, the Supreme Court held that the Medicare statute does not generally
authorize retroactive rulemaking, 

Bowen

 v. 

Georgetown University 
Hosp.

, 488 U.S. 204 (1988) (``

Georgetown

''). Therefore, the 
Administrator of HCFA issued HCFA Ruling 89-1 (Jan. 26, 1989) which, first, discontinued retroactive application
of the 1986 rule and, second, required 
application of the pre-1979 utilization method to all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly
pending appeals of the malpractice issue, for cost reporting periods beginning before the May 1, 1986 effective date
of the 1986 rule. 

The prospective applicability of the 1986 malpractice rule was circumscribed from its outset by the prospective
payment system. For hospitals subject to the prospective payment system, malpractice insurance costs attributable
to inpatient services paid under the prospective payment system 
are subsumed under the prospectively determined payment rates that are applied to the various diagnosis related
groups. Thus, the 1986 malpractice rule applied prospectively to only malpractice insurance costs attributable
to: (1) outpatient services furnished by prospective payment hospitals; and (2) all services furnished by specialty
hospitals and distinct-part hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system.

In the March 27, 1987 final rule, we determined that it was necessary to develop separate ``scaling factor formula''
values under the 1986 malpractice rule (see  413.56(b)(3) through (5)), for malpractice insurance costs attributable
to hospital outpatient services and for costs attributable to inpatient services furnished by facilities excluded
from the prospective payment system (see 52 FR 9836). However, we were unable to derive separate formula values for
inpatient and outpatient services for ``the R factor'' in the formula (that is, the national Medicare malpractice
loss ratio, as adjusted for associated claims adjustment expense), due to the difficulty of securing hospital data
attributing malpractice claims (and associated claims 
adjustment expense) separately to outpatient services and inpatient services. Moreover, separate scaling factor
formula values for hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system were not developed. 

In 

Children's National Medical Center, et al.

 v. 

Sullivan,

 Civil Action No. 90-1362-WBB (D.D.C. July 16, 1991) (``

Children's National

''), the Secretary entered into a Consent Order providing that the 1986 malpractice rule is invalid and shall not be
enforced, due to the agency's inability to develop separate scaling factor formula values for outpatient services
and for inpatient services furnished by hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system. The 

Children's National

 Consent Order was approved by the United States District Court for 
the District of Columbia on July 16, 1991. The Administrator of HCFA then issued HCFA Ruling 91-1 (Sept. 30, 1991),
which, first, provided that the 

Children's National

 Consent Order governs all open hospital malpractice 
insurance cost claims, and all properly pending appeals of the malpractice issue, for cost reporting periods beginning
on or after May 1, 1986 and, second, required reimbursement of such claims under the pre-1979 utilization method.


The Supreme Court's 

Georgetown

 decision, the 

Children's National

 Consent Order, and the two corresponding HCFA Rulings establish that the 1986 malpractice rule is null and void as
to all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly pending hospital appeals of the malpractice
insurance cost reimbursement issue. See 42 CFR 401.108(c). See also HCFA Transmittal No. 395 (December 1993), which
deleted as ``obsolete,'' due to HCFA Ruling 91-1, the implementation provisions for the 1986 rule that were
formerly included in  2214 of the Medicare Intermediary 
Manual, Part 2. We are proposing to conform Medicare regulations to the actual state of the law governing provider
malpractice insurance cost reimbursement by removing  413.56 from the regulations, and by eliminating all
cross-references to  413.56 from the regulations. As a result of this proposal, the amended Medicare rules
would reflect the previously established legal requirement that reasonable cost reimbursement for provider malpractice

insurance cost claims that are either open or the subject of properly pending appeals, must be determined under the
pre-1979 utilization method. 



C. Related Technical Changes (  412.20, 412.22, 412.25, 412.27, 412.29, 412.30, 412.96, 412.105, 412.108,
412.116, 412.130, 412.71, 413.40, 413.53, 413.174 and 482.66) 



We are proposing to remove the words ``distinct part'', wherever they appear, in the following places: 

(a) Section 412.20(b)(1); 
(b) Section 412.22(b); 
(c) The section title and paragraph (a) of  412.25; 
(d) The undesignated introductory texts of   412.27 and 412.29; 
(e) The section title of  412.30; 
(f) Section 412.96(c)(1) and (c)(2); 
(g) Section 412.105(b), (f)(5) and (g)(1)(iii); 
(h) Section 412.108(a)(2); 
(i) Section 412.116(a) and (b); 
(j) The section title of 412.130; 
(k) Section 412.130(a)(2) and (a)(3); 
(l) Section 413.40(a)(2)(ii), (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) and (f)(2); and 
(m) In  482.66(a)(7)(i), the second appearance of the words ``distinct part'' are removed. 

We also propose to revise the section titles of   412.27 and 412.29 to remove the words ``distinct part''
and replace them with the word ``excluded''. 

In addition, we propose to make technical changes to   412.71(b), 413.53 and 413.174(b)(4)(iv) to remove
and replace obsolete language and to correct references.

VII. ProPAC Recommendations 



We have reviewed the March 1, 1994 report submitted by ProPAC to Congress and have given its recommendations careful
consideration in conjunction with the proposals set forth in this document. Recommendations 1 through 6 focus 
on specific features of the President's Health Security Act and other health care reform activities and will be resolved
through the legislative process. Therefore, we are not addressing these recommendations in this document. 
Recommendations 9, 12, and 13 concerning the update factors for inpatient operating costs are discussed in Appendix
D of this proposed rule. Recommendations 10 and 11 concerning the update factors for inpatient capital costs are also
discussed in Appendix E. Recommendations 15 and 16 concerning hospital wage data and the hospital wage index are discussed
in section III of this preamble. The remaining recommendations are discussed below. 



A. Controlling Medicare Spending Across All Sites of Care (Recommendation 7) 





Recommendation:

 Medicare should continue to develop policies to monitor and control total expenditure growth across all sites of
care. Payment methods should not unduly favor the choice of one site over another. They should also provide consistent
incentives to constrain increases in volume and service intensity across physicians and other providers. 



Response:

 In response to a similar ProPAC recommendation last year, we stated in the proposed rule for FY 1994 that controlling
the overall growth of Medicare spending is of critical importance. We believe the hospital 
inpatient prospective payment system has been effective in slowing the growth in Medicare spending compared with
estimates of growth in spending under reasonable cost reimbursement. Also, during the first 2 years of the 
physician fee schedule, the growth in spending for physician services under Medicare has been reduced. In addition,
we are developing a prospective payment system for outpatient hospital services that will provide the appropriate
economic incentives to help control the growth of Medicare spending for outpatient services. 

While prospective payment has shown promise for controlling Medicare spending growth, we remain concerned about
growth in the volume and intensity of Medicare services. Currently, we are using the Medicare volume performance
standard to provide physicians with incentives to control volume and intensity. 

There are no similar volume control systems for other services. We are continuing to study other mechanisms for controlling
expenditures growth, such as bundling payments for multiple services into a single payment. 



B. Strengthening Medicare's Risk Contracting Program (Recommendation 8) 





Recommendation:

 The Commission recommends that the Secretary improve Medicare's risk-based managed care program to give more Medicare
beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans. To increase plan participation, 
deficiencies related to the risk adjustment formula and local differences in payments need to be corrected. 



Response:

 We support giving more Medicare beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans. We are aware of the need
to institute new methodologies for payment to risk plans. Currently, we are sponsoring research on risk adjustment
methods, including diagnostic cost groups (DCGs) and ambulatory care groups (ACGs). In addition, our recent grants
announcement (Health Care Financing Research and Demonstration Cooperative Agreements and Grants for Fiscal Years
1994 Through 1996) (59 FR 1951) calls for work on risk adjustors, both for the Medicare and the under 65 populations.
We have also initiated a demonstration that is expected to test alternative payment methods that may incorporate
adjustments for enrollee health status. 

With regard to correcting local differences in payment to Medicare risk plans, we note that section 1876 of the Act
requires payment to Medicare risk plans to be based on projected Medicare per capita costs for beneficiaries who 
are not enrolled in managed care plans. Given that there are local differences in Medicare's per capita costs for these
beneficiaries, local differences in Medicare's risk plan payment rates are a logical result. 



C. Update to the Composite Rate for Dialysis Services (Recommendation 14) 





Recommendation:

 The FY 1995 update recommendation for the composite rate for dialysis services accounts for the following: 

 The projected increase in the market basket for dialysis services in FY 1995, estimated at 4.3 percent; 

 A positive adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to reflect the additional costs associated with scientific
and technological advances; 

 A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points to encourage productivity improvements; and 

 A negative discretionary adjustment of 4.0 percentage points to reflect the relationship between payments
and estimated FY 1994 costs.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00099 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This results in a net update recommendation of 0.0 
percent. 


Response:

 We agree with ProPAC's recommendation not to 
propose a payment rate increase for dialysis services. The 
1991 audited data support this decision. As the Commission 
points out, these data show that independent renal facility 
composite payment rates are higher than their Medicare 
allowable costs, while hospital renal facilities continue to 
report costs in excess of their payment rates. The audits 
did not provide an explanation for the higher reported costs 
of hospital renal facilities relative to independent renal 
facilities. However, auditors found that hospital renal 
facilities often fail to maintain adequate records for 
allocation costs in the renal department. Since hospitals' 
payments are not affected by renal cost reports, Supplement 
Worksheet I of HCFA-2552, hospitals do not always complete 
their cost reports accurately. 
Although we realize the importance of regular renal 
audits, the budget for audits continues to decline. Thus, 
we do not plan to conduct renal audits in 1994 or 1995. We 
have requested funds to conduct renal audits in 1996. 
During this 2-year interval, we would review the 1992 and 
1993 cost report data for those renal facilities in the 1991 
audit sample. 
We believe that this analysis will provide cost 
information about the ESRD program in lieu of audited data 
for these years. Furthermore, it will provide a basis for 
analyzing cost data over time and allow for better 
comparison of audited and unaudited costs. 


D. Nursing Facility Wage Index (Recommendation 17) 




Recommendation:

 The Secretary should collect data on 
employee compensation and paid hours of employment for 
employees of nursing facilities that care for Medicare 
skilled nursing facility (SNF) patients. Once these data 
become available, the Secretary should develop a nursing 
facility wage index and use it to adjust Medicare skilled 
nursing facility payments. 


Response:

 In recommending an adjustment to SNF 
payments, we presume that ProPAC is referring to the SNF 
cost limits. We agree that HCFA should collect the data 
necessary to develop a SNF wage index. In the conference 
report on OBRA 1993, the conferees indicated an expectation 
that HCFA collect such data (H.R. Rep. No. 2264, 103d Cong., 
1st Sess. 747 (1993)). However, we do not believe it is 
prudent to recommend implementing a SNF wage index to adjust 
the SNF cost limits until the accuracy of those data and 
impact of the resulting wage index have been thoroughly 
analyzed. Under current Medicare rules, most SNFs are paid 
their reasonable costs for routine services subject to a 
cost limit. The current methodology for computing the SNF 
routine service cost limits utilizes the hospital wage index 
to account for geographic variations in wages. Only about 
35 percent of facilities have costs at or above these cost 
limits. 
We have maintained that, because hospitals and SNFs 
generally compete for employees in the same labor market, 
one would expect that the relationship of hospital area 
average wages to hospital national average wages would 
fairly represent the relationship of SNF area average wages 
to SNF national average wages. Therefore, we believe the 
hospital wage index is an accurate mechanism for adjusting 
the SNF routine service cost limits for geographic 
variations in wages. While certain limited studies have 
suggested that a SNF-specific wage index may be more 
accurate, no substantial empirical data have been offered to 
refute our policy. The study undertaken by ProPAC utilized 
only limited data to develop a simulated wage index. Due to 
the limited scope of this study, we believe it is not a 
sufficient basis for refuting the accuracy of the hospital 
wage index relative to SNF wages. 
We plan to begin collecting SNF wage data for potential 
use in the development of a SNF wage index. These data will 
help us answer two important questions related to the 
development of a SNF wage index. The first is whether SNFs, 
which are smaller than hospitals and have less sophisticated 
accounting systems, can develop and provide accurate wage 
index data on a national basis. If such data can be 
provided, our second question is whether differences between 
the resulting wage index and the hospital wage index would 
be significant enough to justify the increased Medicare 
costs involved and the increased reporting and information 
collection burden on SNFs (especially small and rural SNFs), 
the fiscal intermediaries, and HCFA. 
The collection of SNF wage data also will allow us to 
determine the potential impact of a SNF wage index on 
payments to individual SNFs. A change in the wage index may 
favorably impact SNFs in some areas while it may 
disadvantage SNFs in other areas (possibly significantly), 
even within the same State. While this latter point is not 
a reason to avoid the use of a SNF wage index, it does point 
out the absolute necessity for collecting accurate wage 
index data from SNFs for construction of the wage index. 
Our experience with the development of a home health agency 
(HHA) wage index is also relevant. In 1988, HCFA 
implemented an HHA-specific wage index based on data 
received from HHAs. Subsequently, HCFA and Congress 
received numerous complaints from providers concerning the 
burden that the reporting requirements posed and the 
accuracy of the data. As a result, Congress retroactively 
repealed its mandate for use of the HHA wage index and 
required continued use of the hospital wage index. This 
caused great confusion among both providers and fiscal 
intermediaries. 
Until SNF wage data have been collected and examined, 
we believe it is premature to recommend their use for the 
adjustment of either the SNF cost limits or any future 
prospective payment system that may require a wage 
adjustment. 


E. Improving Outlier Payment Policy (Recommendation 18) 




Recommendation:

 The Commission believes the outlier 
payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
of 1993 will improve the current policy for identifying 
outlier cases and determining outlier payments under the 
prospective payment system. However, the following changes 
also should be implemented for FY 1995: 
 The estimated cost of the case and the outlier payment 
amount should no longer be adjusted to reflect the 
hospital's indirect medical education and 
disproportionate share status. 
 The marginal cost factor for cost outliers should be 
increased to 80 percent. 
These changes would further increase the effectiveness 
of outlier payment in protecting against the risk of large 
losses on some cases. They would also improve the 
distribution of outlier payments across hospitals, including 
hospitals that receive a large number of transfer cases. 


Response:

 The Commission's first recommendation with 
regard to improving outlier payment policy concerns the 
methodology we use to determine whether the cost of a case 
exceeds the cost outlier threshold. ProPAC is asking that 
Medicare no longer standardize hospital costs to remove the 
effects of the indirect costs of medical education (IME) and 
the costs associated with serving a disproportionate share 
of low income patients (DSH). The effect of standardizing 
the hospital's charges to remove the effects of their IME 
and DSH adjustments is to lower the ``costs'' of cases, for 
purposes of applying the cost outlier threshold, for 
teaching and disproportionate share hospitals relative to 
other hospitals. 
We responded to this same recommendation in our May 26, 
1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30255). In that response, we 
noted that sections 1886(d)(5)(B)(i) and 1866(d)(5)(F)(ii) 
of the Act require that we pay hospitals for IME and DSH 
costs associated with their outlier payments. Given this 
statutory requirement, we believe it would be inappropriate 
to implement the Commission's recommendation without a 
change to the law.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00100 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In that same response, we also stated our belief that 
the adjustment for IME and to the prospective payment rate 
is currently higher than the additional cost of serving a 
Medicare beneficiary at a teaching hospital. The policy 
advocated by ProPAC in this recommendation would have the 
effect of increasing outlier payments to teaching hospitals. 
Relative to the costs associated with teaching activity, we 
are concerned that the teaching adjustment may 
overcompensate teaching hospitals for their Medicare cases. 
For this reason, we believe it would be inappropriate to 
implement ProPAC's recommendation without making a reduction 
in the level of the IME adjustment. 
We concur with ProPAC's second recommendation regarding 
raising the marginal cost factor for cost outliers to 80 
percent from its current level of 75 percent. We currently 
pay 75 percent of the difference between the cost of a case 
and the cost outlier threshold. Paying 75 percent of costs 
beyond a threshold protects hospitals against inordinate 
losses resulting from the costliest Medicare cases. As we 
describe in section IV.D. of this proposed rule, section 
13501(c) of Public Law 103-66 requires that we phase-out 
payments for day outliers, while simultaneously increasing 
payments for cost outliers. We believe the change mandated 
by the statute improves Medicare's outlier policy by 
focusing outlier payments on the costliest cases. 
Consistent with focusing Medicare's outlier payments on 
cases with the greatest losses, we are raising the marginal 
cost factor to 80 percent. We note that raising the 
marginal cost factor to 80 percent necessitates an increase 
in the fixed loss cost outlier threshold in order to 
maintain outlier payments at 5.1 percent of estimated total 
prospective payments. 


F. Level of the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment to 
PPS Operating Payments (Recommendation 19) 




Recommendation:

 The Commission recommends that the 
indirect medical education adjustment to prospective 
payments for hospital inpatient operating costs be reduced 
from its current level of 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent for 
fiscal year 1995. This reduction should be implemented with 
the anticipated decrease in indirect medical education 
payments returned to all hospitals through a proportionate 
increase in the standardized payment amounts. The 
Commission also recommends continuation of the indirect 
medical education adjustment to operating payments until an 
alternative system of compensating appropriately for the 
higher costs of patient care in teaching institutions is 
fully operational. 


Response:

 The first part of this recommendation is 
identical to ProPAC's recommendation on the level of the IME 
adjustment for FY 1994, to which we responded in the May 26, 
1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30255) and September 1, 1993 final 
rule (58 FR 46326) containing the changes to the prospective 
payment systems for FY 1994. We agree that the IME 
adjustment should be reduced. Although we have disagreed 
with ProPAC in the past over the degree of reduction, we 
have proposed reductions as part of the President's budgets 
for the last several years. 
With respect to ProPAC's methodology for estimating the 
indirect cost effect of teaching without accounting for the 
DSH adjustment, we explained our opposition to this 
suggestion in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 
46328). To reiterate, our analysis indicates that there is 
evidence of significantly higher costs related to DSH among 
urban hospitals with 100 or more beds (see O'Dougherty et 
al., 

Health Care Financing Review

, Winter 1992, p. 31). 
Since these hospitals receive over 96 percent of all DSH 
payments, we believe ProPAC's claim that ``DSH payments 
generally do not reflect differences in costs'' is 
overstated. We do agree, however, that the current level of 
DSH payments exceeds the measured cost effect of DSH even 
among urban hospitals with 100 or more beds. In that 
regard, we point out that in the regression model used to 
estimate the teaching effect, we did not specify the DSH 
variable as the level of DSH payments, but instead set it 
equal to the DSH percentage for urban hospitals with 100 or 
more beds and zero for all other hospitals. (For a complete 
description of our estimating model, see the August 30, 1991 
final rule implementing the capital prospective payment 
system, 56 FR 43370.) As ProPAC alludes to in its report, 
not controlling for DSH leads to its higher IME cost 
estimate relative to our IME cost estimate. 
The remainder of ProPAC's recommendation raises policy 
issues related to the appropriate level of IME funding as 
the transition is made from the current system to the new 
health care system. Since these transition issues are 
currently being addressed as part of the health care reform 
debate, we are not responding in this document to this part 
of ProPAC's recommendation. 


G. Prospective Payment Method for Outpatient Services 
(Recommendation 20) 




Recommendation:

 The Commission believes a prospective 
payment system for hospital outpatient services should be 
implemented. Outpatient payment reform should result in 
consistent policies across all sites and providers. Payment 
should be based on a prospective price per unit of service 
until other methods can be developed that would 
appropriately control the volume of services. The payment 
rate should be adjusted to reflect justifiable cost 
differences across settings. 


Response:

 We appreciate ProPAC's support for efforts 
to develop a prospective payment system for hospital 
outpatient services. We share the Commission's view that a 
hospital outpatient prospective payment system can provide 
meaningful incentives for controlling costs. We also 
believe that such a system could have the potential to be 
adapted for other outpatient settings, resulting in more 
consistent policies across varying sites of service. We 
look forward to the Commission's comments when our report on 
a hospital outpatient prospective payment system is issued. 


H. Revision of Payment Formula for Outpatient Services 
(Recommendation 21) 




Recommendation:

 Until prospective payment systems can 
be implemented for hospital outpatient services, the blend 
formula used to calculate hospital payments for ambulatory 
surgery center-approved procedures, radiology services, and 
diagnostic services should be revised. The formula should 
subtract beneficiary copayment after the total payment has 
been calculated. The resulting reduction in Medicare 
program payments to hospitals should be used to partially 
offset increases in program expenditures due to reducing 
beneficiary liability.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 We agree that the blend formula used to 
calculate Medicare payments to hospitals for ambulatory 
surgical center-approved procedures, radiology services, and 
certain other diagnostic procedures should be revised, as 
suggested by ProPAC. It should be noted that the 
President's proposed Health Security Act contains a 
provision that would make the correction suggested by 
ProPAC. 


I. Beneficiary Liability for Hospital Outpatient Services 
(Recommendation 22) 




Recommendation:

 Beneficiary coinsurance for hospital 
outpatient services should be limited to 20 percent of the 
Medicare-allowed payment, as it is in other settings. For 
services not paid on a prospective basis, beneficiary 
copayment would need to be estimated because it is not known 
at the time of service delivery. 


Response:

 We share ProPAC's concern that beneficiaries 
may be paying a disproportionate share of the total payment 
for hospital outpatient services under the current cost 
based system. However, we are in the process of developing 
a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient 
services that will be moving away from costs and charges as 
a basis for payment. We believe that it would be most 
appropriate to make any changes to beneficiary coinsurance 
in conjunction with the implementation of this hospital 
outpatient prospective payment system. Therefore, as we 
develop this system, we are reviewing the issue of 
beneficiary liability and are working to come up with an 
approach that will be fair to beneficiaries, while 
minimizing the negative financial impact on the Medicare 
program. 


J. Limit the Length of Outpatient Observation Stays 
(Recommendation 23) 




Recommendation:

 The Commission recommends limiting the 
length of hospital outpatient observation stays. Further, 
these changes should be coordinated with Peer Review 
Organizations (PROs) so that appropriate short stay 
admissions are not denied. ProPAC supports HCFA's efforts 
in this regard. 


Response:

 We appreciate ProPAC's support for our 
efforts to limit the length of hospital outpatient 
observation stays. Later this year, we plan to release 
Part A Intermediary Manual and Hospital Manual instructions 
to help curb inappropriate use of outpatient observation 
services, including lengthy stays of days and weeks. These 
instructions will require hospitals to admit patients who 
have been under observation in outpatient departments for 
two consecutive midnights. 
Release of this new national policy will provide needed 
consistency throughout the country in applying outpatient 
observation service guidelines, reduce inappropriate use of 
such services, and reduce the beneficiary's liability for 
Part B copayments. 
On August 13, 1993, we released a letter to the 
Executive Directors of all PROs to clarify PRO 
responsibilities when conducting reviews of cases involving 
short hospital stays. PROs were asked to assure that their 
review staffs base their determinations on the beneficiary's 
need for inpatient services rather than basing the decision 
on the payment consequences.

VIII. Other Required Information 


A. Paperwork Reduction Act 


As discussed in detail in section III.C. of this 
preamble, we are proposing several changes to forms used to 
gather hospital wage data, specifically the Worksheet S-3, 
Part II, of the Medicare cost report, and the provider cost 
report questionnaire (HCFA-339). The current information 
collection requirements associated with these items have 
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
under approval numbers 0938-0050 and 0938-0301, 
respectively. We are proposing that the changes to these 
forms would be effective for cost reporting periods 
beginning on or after October 1, 1994. However, these 
changes will not be effective until OMB approval is received 
under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 


B. Requests for Data from the Public 


In order to respond promptly to public requests for 
data related to the prospective payment system, we have set 
up a process under which commenters can gain access to the 
raw data on an expedited basis. Generally, the data are 
available in computer tape format or cartridges; however, 
some files are available on diskette. Data files are listed 
below with the cost of each. Anyone wishing to purchase 
data tapes, cartridges, or diskettes should submit a written 
request along with a company check or money order (payable 
to HCFA-PUF) to cover the cost, to the following address: 
Health Care Financing Administration, Public Use Files, 
Accounting Division, P.O. Box 7520, Baltimore, Maryland 
21207-0520, (410) 597-5151. 


1. Expanded Modified MedPAR-Hospital (National)

C. Public Comments 



Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge
or respond to them individually. However, in preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments concerning the
provisions of this proposed rule that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``Dates'' section of this preamble
and respond to those comments in the preamble to that rule. We emphasize that, given the statutory requirement under
section 1886(e)(5) of the Act that our final rule for FY 1995 be published by September 1, 1994, we will consider only
those comments that deal specifically with the matters discussed in this proposed rule.

A. Part 412 would be amended as follows: 



PART 412_PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS FOR INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES 



1. The authority citation for part 412 continues to read as follows: 






Authority:

 Secs. 1102, 1815(e), 1820, 1871, and 1886 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395g(e), 1395i-4, 1395hh, and
1395ww). 



Subpart A_General Provisions 



2. In  412.4, paragraphs (a)(3), (b) introductory text, (b)(2), and (b)(3)(ii) are revised, a new paragraph
(b)(4) is added, and paragraph (d)(1) is revised to read as follows: 



 412.4 

Discharges and transfers. 



(a) * * * 

(3) For discharges occurring before October 1, 1994, the patient is transferred to a hospital or hospital unit that
is excluded from the prospective payment systems under subpart B of this part. 

(b) 

Transfers.

 A discharge of a hospital inpatient is not counted for purposes of the prospective payment systems when the patient
is transferred_ 



* * * * * 



(2) From the care of a hospital paid under this section to the care of another such hospital; 

(3) * * * 

(ii) Whose first cost reporting period under the prospective payment systems has not yet begun; or

(d) 

Payment to a hospital transferring an inpatient to another hospital or unit.

 (1) A hospital that transfers an inpatient under the circumstances described in paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4)
of this section, is paid a graduated per diem rate for each day of the patient's stay in that hospital, not to exceed the
amount that would have been paid under subparts D, E, and M of this part if the patient had been discharged to another
setting. The per diem is determined by dividing the appropriate prospective payment rates (as determined under subparts
D, E, and M of this part) by the geometric mean length of stay for the specific Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) into which
the case falls. Payment is graduated by paying twice the per diem for the first day of the stay, and paying the per diem
amount for each subsequent day, up to the full DRG payment amount as described in this paragraph.

Average age of fixed assets. 

The average age of fixed assets is the ratio of accumulated depreciation for buildings and fixed equipment to current
depreciation expense for buildings and fixed equipment. The average age of fixed assets is determined from information
on the Medicare cost report. 



Current ratio. 

Current ratio means the ratio of current liabilities to current assets. The current ratio is determined from information
on the Medicare cost report.



Fixed assets. 

Fixed assets mean buildings and fixed equipment. 

(b) 

Criterion for additional payment during the transition period. 

An additional payment is made to a hospital paid under either the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless
payment methodology as determined under paragraph (c) of this section for cost reporting periods beginning on or

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Minimum payment level by class of hospital. 

(1) HCFA establishes a minimum payment level by class of hospital. The minimum payment level for a hospital will equal
a fixed percentage of the hospital's capital-related 
costs. The minimum payment levels may be no greater than the percentages of allowable capital-related costs that
follow: 

(i) 90 percent for sole community hospitals. 

(ii) 80 percent for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of  412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined
under  412.105(b), that have a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent as 
determined under  412.106(b), and for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of  412.63(a) with
at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under  412.106(c)(2). 

(iii) 70 percent for all other hospitals. 

(2) HCFA will issue the minimum payment levels for each class of hospital in determining the additional exception
payment in the annual notice of capital prospective payment rates, published in accordance with  412.8(b).


(d) 

Additional payments. 

A hospital is entitled to an additional payment if its capital payments for the cost reporting period would otherwise
be less than the applicable minimum payment level. The additional payment equals the difference between the applicable
minimum payment level and the capital payments that the hospital would otherwise receive minus any offset amount
determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 

(e) 

Determining a hospital's exception payment amount

_(1) 

Cumulative comparison. 

For each cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, the hospital's exception payment is determined
by comparing the cumulative 
payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels
applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system. 

(2) 

Offsetting amounts. 

Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted
from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting 
period. 

(f) 

Additional payment exception for extraordinary circumstances. 

(1) A hospital may request an additional payment if the hospital incurs unanticipated capital expenditures in excess
of $5 million (net of proceeds from other payment sources such as insurance, litigation decisions and other State,
local or Federal government funding programs) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control.
Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a flood, fire, or earthquake. 

(2) A hospital must apply to its HCFA Regional Office by the later of October 1, 1992 or 180 days after the extraordinary
circumstance causing the unanticipated expenditures for a determination by the Director, Office of Payment Policy,
Bureau of Policy Development, HCFA of whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment based on the nature
of the circumstances and the amount of financial loss documented by the hospital. 

(3) Except for sole community hospitals, the additional payment is based on a minimum payment amount of 85 percent
for Medicare's share of allowable capital-related costs attributable to the extraordinary circumstances. For

sole community hospitals, the minimum payment amount is 100 percent. 

(4) The minimum payment level applicable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is adjusted to take into account the
85 percent minimum payment level (100 percent for sole community hospitals) under paragraph (f)(3) of this section
for the unanticipated capital-related costs. The additional payment for the cost reporting period equals the difference
between the adjusted minimum payment level and the capital payments the hospital would otherwise receive less any
offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 

(g) 

Special exceptions process. 

For eligible hospitals that meet an age of assets test, receive any required approval from a State or local planning
authority, and, in the case of urban hospitals, meet an excess capacity test, an additional payment may be made for
up to 10 years beyond the end of the capital prospective payment system transition period. 

(1) 

Eligible hospitals. 

The following classes of hospitals are eligible to receive exceptions payments under this special exceptions provision:


(i) Sole community hospitals that have a current ratio less than or equal to 1.75 in the exception year. 

(ii) Hospitals located in an urban area under  412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under  412.105(b),
that either have a disproportionate share of at least 20.2 percent as determined under  412.106(b) or qualify
for disproportionate share payments under  412.106(c)(2), and that have a current ratio less than or equal
to 1.75 in the exception year. 

(iii) Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent. 

(2) 

Age of assets test. 

A hospital meets the age of assets test if_

(i) Its average age of fixed assets is at or above the 75th percentile for the hospital's first cost reporting period
beginning on or after October 1, 1991; and 
(ii) Its average age of fixed assets in a subsequent cost reporting period (but no later than the last cost reporting
period beginning before October 1, 2001) declines by at least 50 percent from its average age of fixed assets in the
first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991. 
(3) 

Planning authority approval. 

The hospital must obtain any required approval from a State or local planning authority. 
(4) 

Excess capacity test for urban hospitals. 

Urban hospitals that are not required to receive approval from a State or local planning authority must demonstrate
that either_
(i) The overall average occupancy rate in its metropolitan statistical area is at least 80 percent; or 
(ii) Its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior capacity (in terms of bed size). 
(5) 

Minimum payment level. 

The minimum payment level for qualifying hospitals will be 70 percent. 
(6) 

Limitation on the period for exception payments. 

A qualifying hospital may receive an exceptions payment for up to 10 years from the year in which it first meets the age
of assets test, provided that it meets the age of asset test no later than the last cost reporting period beginning before
October 1, 2001. 
(7) 

Determining a hospital's exception payment amount_

(i) 

Cumulative comparison. 

For each cost reporting period, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments
made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable
to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system. 
(ii) 

Offsetting amounts. 

Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted
from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period. 
(iii) 

Other offset. 

Any amount by which the hospital's Medicare inpatient operating and capital prospective payments exceed its Medicare
inpatient operating and capital costs is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for
the cost reporting period. 
(h) 

Limit on exception payments. 

Total estimated payments under the exception process may not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective
payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for old capital) for the same fiscal year.

b. Paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2)(ii) are revised, and paragraphs (e)(2)(iii), (e)(2)(iv) and (e)(4) are added. 
The revisions and additions are to read as follows: 


 413.134

Depreciation: Allowance for depreciation based on asset costs. 


* * * * * 


(e) * * * 
(1) 

Incentive. 

As an incentive for funding, investment income on funded depreciation is not treated as a reduction of allowable interest
expense. Investment income earned on deposits before the 6-month period elapses are not offset unless the deposits
are withdrawn for an improper purpose during this period. 
(2) * * * 
(ii) Borrowing for a purpose for which funded depreciation account funds should have been used makes the borrowing
unnecessary to the extent that funded depreciation account funds were available at the time of the borrowing. Available
funds in the funded depreciation account, to the extent of the unnecessary borrowing, are called ``tainted'' funds.
Interest expense incurred on borrowing for a capital purpose is not an allowable cost to the extent that funded depreciation
account funds were available at the time of the borrowing. 
(iii) A provider can remove the ``unnecessary'' characterization of borrowing, and thereby cure tainted funded
depreciation, by using the tainted funds for a proper purpose described in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section. However,
any funded depreciation that existed at the time of the unnecessary borrowing and is not classified as tainted must
be used before any of the tainted funds. 
(iv) When only a portion of the borrowing is considered unnecessary under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, subsequent
repayments of such borrowing from general funds is applied first to the allowable portion of the borrowing and then,
when all of the allowable borrowing is repaid, to the unallowable portion of the borrowing. When funds from the funded
depreciation account are used for the repayment of the unnecessary borrowing, an equivalent amount of tainted funds
is cured without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section. Similarly,
where general funds are used to pay for the unallowable borrowing after the necessary borrowing has been repaid, an
equivalent amount of tainted funded depreciation is cured without regard to the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(ii)
and (e)(3)(i)(C) of this section. 


* * * * * 


(4) 

Loans from funded depreciation. 

(i) When the general fund of the provider borrows from the funded depreciation to obtain working capital for normal
operating expenses to furnish patient care, interest incurred by the general fund is an allowable operating cost
only if the interest expense is supported by documents that evidence that the funds were borrowed and that payment
of interest and repayment of the funds are required, is separately identified in the provider's accounting records,
and meets the necessary and proper tests described in   413.153 (b)(2) and (b)(3). 
(ii) Loans from funded depreciation to the general fund are considered investments of funded depreciation, but do
not have to meet the readily marketable test described in paragraph (e) of this section. Loans made from funded depreciation
are subject to the requirement that funded depreciation must be available for the acquisition of depreciable assets
used to furnish patient care, or for other capital purposes related to patient care. Costs incurred to secure lines
of credit from lending institutions to ensure such availability are not allowable costs. 
(iii) Funding of depreciation from general funds will not be recognized to the extent of any outstanding loans from
the funded depreciation account to the general fund. Deposits from the general fund into the funded depreciation
account must be first applied to reduce any loans outstanding from the funded depreciation to the general fund. When
the loans are repaid in full, general funds deposited in the funded depreciation account are considered as repayments
of the general fund. Therefore, any subsequent interest expense of the general fund paid to the funded depreciation
fund is not an allowable cost. 


* * * * * 


7. In  413.153, paragraph (d)(2) is revised and a new paragraph (d)(3) is added to read as follows: 


 413.153

Interest expense. 


* * * * * 


(d) * * * 
(2) In determining whether a loan was made for the purpose of acquiring a facility, we apply any owner's investment
or funds first to the tangible assets, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the 
goodwill. If the owner's investment or funds are not sufficient to cover the cost allowed for tangible assets, we apply
funds borrowed to finance the acquisition to the portion of the allowed cost of the tangible assets not covered by the
owner's investment, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and lastly to the goodwill. Repayments of
the funds borrowed are applied first to the tangible assets, then to the intangible assets other than goodwill, and
lastly to the goodwill. 
(3) When a provider borrows funds for a purpose related to patient care, but only some of the funds are necessary, repayments
of the loan are applied first to pay for the necessary portion of the loan. Only after all of the necessary portion has
been repaid are any repayments applied to the unnecessary portion of the loan.

Addendum_Proposed Schedule of Standardized Amounts Effective with Discharges On or After October 1, 1994 and Update
Factors and Rate-of-Increase Percentages Effective With Cost Reporting Periods Beginning On or After October 1,
1994 


I. Summary and Background 


In this addendum, we are setting forth the proposed amounts and factors for determining prospective payment rates
for Medicare inpatient operating costs and Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. We are also setting forth
new proposed rate-of-increase percentages for updating the target amounts for hospitals and hospital units excluded
from the prospective payment system. 
For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, except for sole community hospitals and hospitals located in
Puerto Rico, each hospital's payment per discharge under the prospective payment system will be comprised of 100
percent of the Federal national rate. 
Sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate payment:
the Federal national rate, the updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 1982 cost per discharge, or the updated
hospital-specific rate based on FY 1987 cost per discharge. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid on the basis of a rate
per discharge comprised of 75 percent of a Puerto Rico rate and 25 percent of a national rate (section 1886(d)(9)(A)
of the Act). 
As discussed below in section II, we are proposing to make changes in the determination of the prospective payment
rates for Medicare inpatient operating costs. The changes, to be applied prospectively, would affect the calculation
of the Federal rates. In section III we discuss our proposed changes for determinating the prospective payment rates
for Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. Section IV sets forth our proposed changes for determining the rate-of-increase
limits for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. The tables to which we refer in the preamble to
the proposed rule are presented at the end of this addendum in section V. 


II. Proposed Changes to Prospective Payment Rates For Inpatient Operating Costs for FY 1995 


The basic methodology for determining prospective payment rates for inpatient operating costs is set forth at  412.63
for hospitals located outside of Puerto Rico. The basic methodology for determining the prospective payment rates
for inpatient operating costs for hospitals located in Puerto Rico is set forth at   412.210 and 412.212.
Below, we discuss the manner in which we are changing some of the factors used for determining the prospective payment
rates. The Federal and Puerto Rico rate changes, once issued as final, will be effective with discharges occurring
on or after October 1, 1994. As discussed in section IV.C of this proposed rule, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) specifies
that for discharges occurring in the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1994, the average standardized amount for hospitals
located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an other urban area.
Pursuant to section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, we will update the rural standardized amount by the amount necessary
to equate the rural standardized amount with the other urban standardized amount. As there will no longer be separate
other urban and rural standardized amounts, we will refer to the urban and rural standardized amounts that will be
effective beginning with FY 1995 as the ``other standardized amount.'' As required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the
Act, we must adjust the DRG classifications and weighting factors for discharges in FY 1995. 
In summary, the proposed standardized amounts set forth in Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c of section V of this addendum reflect_

Updates of 1.1 percent for large urban and other urban hospitals (that is, the market basket percentage increase of
3.6 percent minus 2.5 percentage points) and an update for rural hospitals of approximately 8.4 percent (that is,
the amount required to equate the rural standardized amount with the other urban standardized amount); 
 Revised labor and nonlabor shares of the national average standardized amounts to reflect the national average
labor portion of the standardized amounts for urban and rural hospitals (the revised labor and nonlabor shares of
the Puerto Rico standardized amounts reflect the Puerto Rico average labor portion of the standardized amounts for
urban and rural hospitals); 
 An adjustment to ensure budget neutrality as provided for in sections 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) and (d)(3)(E) of
the Act by applying new budget neutrality adjustment factors to the urban and other standardized amounts; 
 An adjustment to ensure budget neutrality as provided for in section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act by removing the
FY 1994 budget neutrality factor and applying a revised factor; and 
 An adjustment to apply the revised outlier offset by removing the FY 1994 outlier offsets and applying a new
offset.

A. Calculation of Adjusted Standardized Amounts 



1. Standardization of Base-Year Costs or Target Amounts



Section 1886(d)(2)(A) of the Act required the establishment of base-year cost data containing allowable operating
costs per discharge of inpatient hospital services for each hospital. The preamble to the September 1, 1983 interim
final rule (48 FR 39763) contains a detailed explanation of how base-year cost data were established in the initial
development of standardized amounts for the prospective payment system and how they are used in computing the Federal
rates. 

Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(i) of the Act required that Medicare target amounts be determined for each hospital located
in Puerto Rico for its cost reporting period beginning in FY 1987. The September 1, 1987 final rule contains a detailed
explanation of how the target amounts were determined and how they are used in computing the Puerto Rico rates (52 FR
33043, 33066). 

The standardized amounts are based on per discharge averages of adjusted hospital costs from a base period or, for
Puerto Rico, adjusted target amounts from a base period, updated and otherwise adjusted in accordance with the provisions
of section 1886(d) of the Act. Sections 1886(d)(2)(C) and (d)(9)(B)(ii) of the Act required that the updated base-year
per discharge costs and, for Puerto Rico, the updated target amounts, respectively, be standardized in order to remove
from the cost data the effects of certain sources of variation in cost among hospitals. These include case mix, differences
in area wage levels, cost of living adjustments for Alaska and Hawaii, indirect medical education costs, and payments
to hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 

Since the standardized amounts have already been adjusted for differences in case mix, wages, cost-of-living, indirect
medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients, no
additional adjustments for these factors for FY 1995 were made. That is, the standardization adjustments reflected
in the FY 1995 standardized amounts are the same as those reflected in the FY 1994 standardized amounts. 

Sections 1886(d)(2)(H) and (d)(3)(E) of the Act require that, in making payments under the prospective payment system,
the Secretary adjust the proportion of payments that are wage-related (as estimated by the Secretary from time to
time). Beginning with October 1, 1990, when the market basket was rebased, we have considered 71.40 percent of costs
to be labor-related for purposes of the prospective payment system.



2. Computing Urban and Other Averages Within Geographic Areas 



Beginning in FY 1995, section 1886(d)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary to compute two average standardized amounts
for discharges occurring in a fiscal year: one for hospitals located in large urban areas and one for hospitals located
in other areas. In addition, under section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iii) of the Act, the average standardized amount per discharge
must be determined for hospitals located in urban and other areas in Puerto Rico. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid
a blend of 75 percent of the applicable Puerto Rico standardized amount and 25 percent of a national standardized payment
amount. 

Section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act defines ``urban areas'' as those areas within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).
A ``large urban area'' is defined as an urban area with a population of more than 1,000,000. In addition, section 4009(i)
of Public Law 100-203 provides that a New England County Metropolitan Area (NECMA) with a population of more
than 970,000 is classified as a large urban area. As required by section 1886(d)(2)(D) of the Act, population size
is determined by the Secretary based on the latest population data published by the Bureau of the Census. Urban areas
that do not meet the definition of a ``large urban area'' are referred to as ``other urban areas.'' Areas that are not
included in MSAs are considered ``rural areas'' under section 1886(d)(2)(D). Payment for discharges from hospitals
located in large urban areas will be based on the large urban standardized amount. Payment will be based on the other
standardized amount for discharges from hospitals located in other urban and rural areas. 

Based on 1991 population estimates published by the Bureau of the Census, 54 areas meet the criteria to be defined as
large urban areas for FY 1995. These areas are identified by an asterisk in Table 4a. 

Table 1a contains the two national standardized amounts that we are proposing be applicable to most hospitals. Under
section 1886(d)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act, the national standardized payment amount applicable to hospitals in Puerto
Rico consists of the discharge-weighted average of the national large urban standardized amount and the national
other standardized amount (as set forth in Table 1a). The national average standardized amount for Puerto Rico is
set forth in Table 1c. This table also includes the two standardized amounts that would be applicable to most hospitals
in Puerto Rico. 



3. Updating the Average Standardized Amounts 



In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act, we are proposing to update the large urban, other urban, and rural
average standardized amounts for FY 1994 using the applicable percentage increases specified in section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)
of the Act. As explained earlier, there are currently separate large urban, other urban and rural standardized payment
amounts, and section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides for the elimination of separate other urban and rural payment
amounts beginning in FY 1995. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, as amended by section 13501(a)(1) of Public
Law 103-66, specifies the following update factors for the standardized amounts for FY 1995: 

 For hospitals located in large urban and other urban areas, the market basket percentage increase minus 2.5
percentage points.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00116 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

 For hospitals located in rural areas, the market basket percentage increase plus the amount necessary to make
the rural standardized amount equal the standardized amount for other urban areas. 

The percentage change in the market basket reflects the average change in the price of goods and services purchased
by hospitals to furnish inpatient care. The most recent forecasted hospital market basket increase for FY 1995 is
3.6 percent. For FY 1995, this yields an update to the urban average standardized amounts of 1.1 percent (3.6 percent
minus 2.5 percent). To satisfy the requirement of section 1886(b)(3)(i)(X) of the Act that the update for hospitals
located in a rural area be equal to that for hospitals located in an other urban area beginning in FY 1995, we estimate
that an overall update of the market basket rate of increase (that is, 3.6 percent) plus approximately 4.8 percentage
points will be necessary. Thus, we are proposing an update to the other urban and rural average standardized amounts
for FY 1995 of 8.4 percent. However, as explained below, we are currently estimating that the overall increase in the
rural standardized amount will be approximately 4.6 percent, as a result of two adjustments that must be made to the
updated standardized amounts. These adjustments were previously applied differentially to the urban and rural
standardized amounts. 

First, we are adjusting the FY 1994 standardized amounts to remove the effects of the FY 1994 geographic reclassifications
and outlier payments before applying the FY 1995 updates. That is, we are increasing the standardized amounts to restore
the reductions that were made for the effects of geographic reclassification and outliers. As these reductions were
larger for urban than rural hospitals, restoring the reductions results in a larger increase in the urban standardized
amounts than the rural standardized amounts. After applying an update of 1.1 percent to the adjusted urban standardized
amount, we estimate that an overall update of 7.3 percent is required to equate the rural and other urban standardized
amounts. 

However, the estimated actual increase in the standardized amounts for rural hospitals will be less because we also
have to reduce the standardized amounts for the effects of geographic reclassification and outliers. For FY 1995,
there will be a single reduction to the standardized amounts for each of these factors, rather than separate adjustments
to the urban and rural standardized amounts based on the effect of geographic reclassification and outliers in each
respective area. For instance, in FY 1994, we reduced the urban standardized amounts by 5.4 percent and the rural standardized
amounts by 2.3 percent to account for outliers in each respective area. For FY 1995, we will apply one adjustment for
the effect of outliers_a single reduction in the standardized amounts of 5.1 percent. Similarly, there were separate
reductions to the standardized amounts in FY 1994 for the effects of geographic reclassification of 0.7 percent for
urban hospitals and 0.1 percent for rural hospitals. Our proposed standardized amounts reflect a single reduction
for this factor of 0.6 percent. After including offsets to the standardized amounts for outliers and geographic reclassification,
we estimate that there will be an actual increase of 4.6 percent to the rural standardized amounts and 1.5 percent to
the urban standardized amounts. A more detailed explanation of the impact of the single standardized amount for other
urban and rural hospitals and single adjustments for the effects of outliers and geographic reclassification is
included in Appendix A of this proposed rule. 

With the phase-out of the rural payment amount, rural hospitals and other urban hospitals will be paid based on the
same standardized amount. Since Congress has mandated the elimination of separate payment rates based on whether
a hospital is located in an urban or rural area, we believe it is appropriate to revise the national average standardized
amounts based on national average labor/nonlabor shares. Therefore, we propose to adjust the labor and nonlabor
proportions of the standardized amount to reflect the national average. (We are revising the Puerto Rico standardized
amounts by the average labor share in Puerto Rico of 82.7 percent.) Currently, the rural labor share represents 75.6
percent of the standardized amount while the urban labor share represents 70.8 percent. This differential is the
result of standardization of labor-related costs by the area wage index. Because rural hospitals generally have
lower wage index values than urban hospitals, the standardization process resulted in a higher labor share for rural
hospitals. We are therefore proposing to adjust the labor/nonlabor proportions of the standardized amounts that
will be applicable to both rural and urban hospitals based on the national average. As a result, the national average
labor share (as reflected in the hospital market basket) will equal 71.4 percent of the standardized payment amounts.


Although the update factor for FY 1995 is set by law, we were required by section 1886(e)(3)(B) of the Act to report to
Congress no later than March 1, 1994 on our initial recommendation of update factors for FY 1995 for both prospective
payment hospitals and hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system. For general information purposes,
we have included the report to Congress as Appendix C to this proposed rule. Our proposed recommendation on the update
factors (which is required by sections 1886(e)(4)(A) and (e)(5)(A) of the Act), as well as our responses to ProPAC's
recommendation concerning the update factor, is set forth as Appendix D to this proposed rule.

4. Other Adjustments to the Average Standardized Amounts 




a. Recalibration of DRG Weights and Updated Wage Index_Budget Neutrality Adjustment. 


Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act specifies that beginning in FY 1991, the annual DRG reclassification and recalibration
of the relative weights must be made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected.
As discussed in section II of the preamble, we normalized the recalibrated DRG weights by an adjustment factor, so
that the average case weight after recalibration is equal to the average case weight prior to recalibration. While
this adjustment is intended to ensure that recalibration does not affect total payments to hospitals, our analysis
indicates that the normalization adjustment does not necessarily achieve budget neutrality with respect to aggregate
payments to hospitals. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act specifies that the hospital wage index must be updated based on new survey data no
later than October 1, 1990 and on an annual basis beginning October 1, 1993. This provision also requires 
that any updates or adjustments to the wage index must be made in a manner that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals
are not affected by the change in the wage index. 
To comply with the requirement of section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act that the DRG reclassification changes and
recalibration of the relative weights be budget neutral and the requirement in section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act that
the updated wage index be implemented in a budget neutral manner, we compared aggregate payments using the FY 1994
relative weights and the wage index effective October 1, 1993 to aggregate payments using the proposed FY 1995 relative
weights and wage index. The same methodology was used for the FY 1994 budget neutrality adjustment. (See the discussion
in the September 1, 1992 final rule (57 FR 39832).) Based on this comparison, we computed a budget neutrality adjustment
factor equal to 0.997647. This budget neutrality adjustment factor is applied to the standardized amounts without
removing the effects of the FY 1994 budget neutrality adjustment. We do not remove the prior budget neutrality adjustment
because the statute requires that aggregate payments after the changes in the DRG relative weights and wage index
equal estimated payments prior to the changes. If we removed the prior year adjustment, we would not satisfy this condition.

In addition, we are proposing to continue to apply the same FY 1995 adjustment factor to the hospital-specific rates
that are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994, in order to ensure that we meet
the statutory requirement that aggregate payments neither increase nor decrease as a result of the implementation
of the DRG weights and updated wage index. (See the discussion in the September 4, 1990 final rule (55 FR 36073).)

b. Reclassified Hospitals_Budget Neutrality Adjustment.

 
Section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act provides that certain rural hospitals are deemed urban effective with discharges
occurring on or after October 1, 1988. In addition, section 1886(d)(10) of the Act provides for the reclassification
of hospitals based on determinations by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (MGCRB). Under section
1886(d)(10) of the Act, a hospital may be reclassified for purposes of the standardized amount or the wage index, or
both. 
Prior to FY 1995, section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act required the Secretary to adjust the urban standardized amounts
so as to ensure that total aggregate payments under the prospective payment system after implementation of the provisions
of sections 1886(d)(8)(B) and (C) and 1886(d)(10) of the Act were equal to the aggregate prospective payments that
would have been made absent these provisions. The rural standardized amounts were also adjusted to ensure that aggregate
payments to rural hospitals not affected by these provisions neither increased nor decreased as a result of these
provisions. Beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary is required to adjust the standardized amounts by the same factor
to account for the effects of reclassification. We applied an adjustment of 0.993814 to ensure that the effects of
reclassification are budget neutral. 
The adjustment factors are applied to the standardized amounts after removing the effects of the FY 1994 budget neutrality
adjustment factors. We note that the proposed 
FY 1995 adjustments reflect wage index and standardized amount reclassifications approved by the MGCRB or the Administrator
as of March 14, 1994. The effects of any additional reclassification changes resulting from appeals and review of
the MGCRB's decisions for FY 1995 or from a hospital's request for the withdrawal of a reclassification request will
be reflected in the final budget neutrality adjustment required under section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act and published
in the final rule for FY 1995. 


c. Outliers.

 
Section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act provides that, in addition to the basic prospective payment rates, payments must
be made for discharges involving day outliers and may be made for cost outliers. Under section 1886(d)(3)(B) of the
Act, the Secretary has been required to separately reduce the urban and rural national standardized amounts by the
proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to outliers in each respective area. Beginning with FY 1995,
section 1886(d)(3)(B) requires the Secretary to adjust both the large urban and other national standardized amounts
by the same factor to account for the estimated proportion of total DRG payments made to outlier cases. Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iv)
of the Act requires that the urban and other standardized amounts applicable to hospitals in Puerto Rico be reduced
by the proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to estimated outlier payments. Furthermore, section
1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act directs that outlier payments in any year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6
percent of total payments projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment rates. 
Section 13501(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66) amended section 1886(d)(5)(A)
with respect to outliers beginning in FY 1995. With regard to cost outliers, section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66
requires that the Secretary modify the methodology for determining the cost outlier threshold. For discharges occurring
before October 1, 1994, a hospital may receive payment for a cost outlier if the adjusted costs for a discharge exceed
a fixed multiple of the DRG payment for the case or a fixed dollar amount. Effective for discharges occurring on or after
October 1, 1994, a hospital may receive payment for a cost outlier if adjusted costs exceed the DRG prospective payment
rate plus a fixed dollar amount. As discussed in section IV.D of the preamble, we refer to this revised cost outlier
threshold as ``fixed loss.'' 
Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66 also amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act with respect to day outliers.
Beginning with FY 1995, section 1886(d)(5)(A) requires the Secretary to reduce the proportion of total outlier payments
paid under the day outlier methodology. Under the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v), the proportion of outlier
payments made under the day outlier methodology, relative to the proportion of outlier payments made under the day
outlier methodology in FY 1994 (which we estimated at 31.3 percent in our September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348)),
shall be 75 percent in FY 1995, 50 percent in FY 1996 and 25 percent in FY 1997. After September 30, 1997, the Secretary
will no longer pay for day outliers under the provisions of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(i). Again, the changes required
by section 1886(d)(5)(A) are discussed in detail in section IV.D of the preamble to this proposed rule. 
i. FY 1995 Outlier Thresholds. 
For FY 1994, the day outlier threshold is the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser of 23 days or 3.0
standard deviations. The marginal cost factor for day outliers (or the percent of Medicare's average per diem payment
paid for each outlier day) is equal to 55 percent in FY 1994. The cost outlier threshold is the greater of 2.0 times the
prospective payment rate for the DRG or $36,000 ($33,000 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment
system for inpatient capital-related costs). The marginal cost factor for cost outliers (or the percent of costs
paid after costs for the case exceed the threshold) is 75 percent. We applied an outlier adjustment to the FY 1994 standardized
amounts of 0.945960 for the urban rates, 0.977157 for the rural rates, and 0.9454 for the capital Federal rate. 
For FY 1995, we propose to set the day outlier threshold at the geometric mean length of stay for each DRG plus the lesser
of 22 days or 3.0 standard deviations. We are also proposing to reduce the marginal cost factor for each outlier day
from 55 percent to 49 percent in FY 1995. 
Our proposed policy will reduce the proportion of outlier payments paid to day outliers as required by section 1886(d)(5)(A)
of the Act. We are also proposing a fixed loss cost outlier threshold in FY 1995 equal to the prospective payment rate
for the DRG plus $23,300 ($21,400 for hospitals that have not yet entered the prospective payment system for capital-related
costs). Additionally, we are proposing to increase the marginal cost factor for cost outliers from 75 to 80 percent.

Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act, we calculated outlier thresholds so that estimated outlier payments
equal 5.1 percent of estimated DRG payments. In conjunction with the elimination of the rural standardized amount,
we considered raising the proportion of operating payments estimated to be paid as outliers from 5.1 percent to 5.5
percent. This is the percentage offset that currently applies to the urban standardized amounts and is in the middle
of the 5 to 6 percent range for outlier payments required by statute. Raising the proportion of operating payments
paid as outliers would reduce the financial risk to hospitals in treating outlier cases. However, financing 5.5 percent
in outlier payments would require reducing the average standardized amounts by 5.5 percent. We welcome comments
on this issue.

The model that we use to determine the outlier thresholds necessary to target our desired outlier payment percentage
for FY 1995 uses the FY 1993 MedPAR file and the most recent available information on hospital-specific payment parameters
(such as the cost-to-charge ratios). This information is based on the January 1994 update of the provider-specific
file used in the PRICER program. In estimating payments we convert billed charges to costs for purposes of estimating
cost outlier payments. As we explained in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46347), prior to FY 1994, we used a charge
inflation factor to adjust charges to costs; beginning with FY 1994, we are currently using a cost inflation factor
to estimate costs. In other words, instead of inflating the FY 1993 charge data by a charge inflation factor for 2 years
in order to estimate FY 1995 charge data and then applying the cost-to-charge ratio, we adjust the charges by the cost-to-charge
ratio and then inflate the estimated costs for 2 years of cost inflation. In this manner, we will be automatically adjusting
for any changes in the cost-to-charge ratios that may occur, since the relevant variable is the costs estimated for
a given case.

In setting the proposed FY 1995 outlier thresholds, we used a cost inflation factor of 1.04735. This is the average
increase in cost per case between PPS-7 (data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990) and PPS-9
(data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1992), for a matched set of hospitals. We made an audit adjustment
for any cost report that had not been settled, based on the average ratio between submitted and final cost report data.
This adjustment was made separately for Medicare inpatient capital costs and Medicare inpatient operating costs.
We used the actual settlement ratio for PPS-7 (data from cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1990), since
most cost reports for that period had been settled. We also used the settlement ratio from PPS-7 for the PPS-8
cost reports, since the PPS-8 settlement ratio currently available is based on many fewer hospitals (approximately
37 percent, as opposed to 92 percent for PPS-7).

When we modeled the combined operating and capital outlier payments, we found that using a common set of thresholds
resulted in a higher percentage of outlier payments for capital-related costs than for operating costs. We estimate
the proposed thresholds for FY 1995 would result in outlier payments equal to 5.1 percent of operating DRG payments
and 6.3 percent of capital payments based on the Federal rate.

As stated in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348), we have established outlier thresholds that would be applicable
to both inpatient operating costs and inpatient capital-related costs. As explained earlier, we will apply a reduction
of approximately 5.1 percent to the FY 1995 standardized amounts to account for the proportion of PPS payments paid
to outliers. The proposed outlier adjustment factors applied to the standardized amounts and the capital Federal
rate for FY 1995 are as follows:








We would apply the proposed outlier adjustment factors after removing the effects of the FY 1994 outlier adjustment
factors on the standardized amounts and the capital Federal rate.



ii. Other Changes Concerning Outliers. Table 5 of section V of this addendum contains the DRG relative weights, geometric
and arithmetic mean lengths of stay, as well as the day outlier threshold for each DRG. When we recalibrate DRG weights,
we set a threshold of 10 cases as the minimum number of cases required to compute a reasonable weight and geometric mean
length of stay. DRGs that do not have at least 10 cases are considered to be low volume DRGs. For the low volume DRGs, we
use the original geometric mean lengths of stay, because no arithmetic mean length of stay was calculated based on
the original data.

Table 8a in section V of this addendum contains the updated Statewide average operating cost-to-charge ratios for
urban hospitals and for rural hospitals to be used in calculating cost outlier payments for those hospitals for which
the intermediary is unable to compute a reasonable hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio. These Statewide average
ratios would replace the ratios published in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46439), effective October 1, 1994.
Table 8b contains comparable Statewide average capital cost-to-charge ratios. These average ratios would be used
to calculate cost outlier payments for those hospitals for which the intermediary computes operating cost-to-charge
ratios lower than 0.279 or greater than 1.314 and capital cost-to-charge ratios lower than 0.013 or greater than 0.241.
This range represents 3.0 standard deviations (plus or minus) from the mean of the log distribution of cost-to-charge
ratios for all hospitals. The cost-to-charge ratios in Tables 8a and 8b would be applied to all hospital-specific
cost-to-charge ratios based on cost report settlements occurring during FY 1995.

iii. FY 1993 and FY 1994 Outlier Payments. In the May 26, 1993 proposed rule (58 FR 30271), we estimated that actual FY
1993 outlier payments would be approximately 4.5 percent of actual FY 1993 total DRG payments. We also estimated that
total DRG payments for FY 1993 would be higher than estimated at the time that we set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds.
Our estimates of actual outlier payments and actual total DRG payments were computed by simulating payments using
actual FY 1993 bill data available at the time. Our current estimate is that actual FY 1993 outlier payments were approximately
4.1 percent of total DRG payments. At the same time, we estimate that FY 1993 total DRG payments per case were 1.6 percent
higher than we estimated when we set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds (1.9 percent higher if indirect teaching and disproportionate
share payments are included). These estimates are based on simulations using the January 1994 update of the provider-specific
file and the December 31, 1993 update of the MedPAR file.

In our June 4, 1992 proposed rule (57 FR 23645), we discussed several factors that could explain the difference between
estimated outlier payments and actual outlier payments, relative to total DRG payments. With regard to FY 1993 outlier
payments, we note that the percentage increase in the Medicare case-mix index was 0.8 percent between FY 1992 and FY
1993, which was a lower rate of increase than for prior years. Although the case-mix index is not a factor in setting
the outlier thresholds, lower growth in FY 1993 indicates that the average severity of a Medicare case increased less
in FY 1993 than in prior years.

We also believe that use of a charge inflation factor in setting the FY 1993 outlier thresholds may account for some
of the difference. As we explained in our June 4, 1992 proposed rule, charges have historically grown faster than costs.
In setting thresholds for FY 1993, we used the most recently available Medicare data, but that data contained 2-year
old cost-to-charge ratios. Thus, the cost-to-charge ratios used to set the FY 1993 outlier thresholds are higher
than those used to determine payments. Consequently, actual FY 1993 outlier payments as a percent of actual total
DRG payments may be lower than we estimated when setting outlier thresholds.

To address this problem in FY 1994, we began using a cost inflation factor rather than a charge inflation factor to update
billed charges for purposes of estimating outlier payments. We believed that this refinement would improve our estimation
methodology.

In the September 1, 1993 final rule, we set the outlier thresholds so that estimated operating outlier payments were
equal to 5.1 percent of estimated total estimated operating prospective payments. We currently estimate that FY
1994 outlier payments will be 4.0 percent of total DRG payments. This figure is based on a computer simulation of payments
in FY 1994 using FY 1993 bill data.

We believe that actual outlier payments as a percentage of actual total DRG payments may be lower than estimated because
actual hospital costs may be lower than reflected in the estimation methodology. Our most recent data on hospital
costs show a significant trend in declining rates of increase. Thus, the cost inflation factor of 8.3 percent used
to estimate FY 1994 outlier payments (based on the best available data) appears to have been overstated. Based on more
recent data, we are using a cost inflation factor of 4.7 percent to set outlier payments for FY 1995. Also, although
we estimate that FY 1994 outlier payments will approximate 4.0 percent of total DRG payments, we note that the estimate
of the market basket rate of increase used to set the FY 1994 rates was 4.3 percentage points, while the latest FY 1994
market basket rate of increase forecast is 2.8 percent. Thus, the net effect is that hospitals are receiving higher
FY 1994 payments than would have been established based on a more recent forecast of the market basket rate of increase.



B. Adjustments for Area Wage Levels and Cost of Living



This section contains an explanation of the application of two types of adjustments to the adjusted standardized
amounts that would be made by the intermediaries in determining the prospective payment rates as described in this
addendum. For discussion purposes, it is necessary to present the adjusted standardized amounts divided into labor
and nonlabor portions. Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c, as set forth in this addendum, contain the actual labor-related and nonlabor-related
shares that will be used to calculate the prospective payment rates for hospitals located in the 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.



1. Adjustment for Area Wage Levels



Sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act require that an adjustment be made to the labor-related
portion of the prospective payment rates to account for area differences in hospital wage levels. This adjustment
is made by multiplying the labor-related portion of the adjusted standardized amounts by the appropriate wage index
for the area in which the hospital is located. In section III of the preamble, we discuss certain revisions we are making
to the wage index. This index is set forth in Tables 4a through 4e of this addendum.



2. Adjustment for Cost of Living in Alaska and Hawaii



Section 1886(d)(5)(H) of the Act authorizes an adjustment to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals
in Alaska and Hawaii. Higher labor-related costs for these two States are taken into account in the adjustment for
area wages described above. For FY 1995, the adjustment necessary for nonlabor-related costs for hospitals in Alaska
and Hawaii would be made by the intermediaries by multiplying the nonlabor portion of the standardized amounts by
the appropriate adjustment factor contained in the table below. If the Office of Personnel Management releases revised
cost-of-living adjustment factors before August 1, 1994, we will publish them in the final rule and use them in determining
FY 1995 payments.

C. DRG Relative Weights



As discussed in section II of the preamble, we have developed a classification system for all hospital discharges,
assigning them into DRGs, and have developed relative weights for each DRG that are intended to reflect the resource
utilization of cases in each DRG relative to Medicare cases in other DRGs. The intermediary makes an adjustment to
the prospective payment rate by multiplying the standardized amount by the relative weight for the DRG to which the
discharge is assigned.

Table 5 of section V of this addendum contains the relative weights that we propose to use for discharges occurring
in FY 1995. These factors have been recalibrated as explained in section II of the preamble.



D. Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for FY 1995



General Formula for Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for FY 1995



Prospective payment rate for all hospitals located outside Puerto Rico except sole community hospitals=Federal
rate.

Prospective payment rate for sole community hospitals=Whichever of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate
payment: 100 percent of the Federal rate, 100 percent of the FY 1982 hospital-specific rate, or 100 percent of the FY
1987 hospital-specific rate.



Prospective payment rate for Puerto Rico=75 percent of the Puerto Rico rate+25 percent of a discharge-weighted average
of the large urban, other urban, and rural national rates.



1. Federal Rate



For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994 and before October 1, 1995, except for sole community hospitals
and hospitals in Puerto Rico, the hospital's rate is comprised exclusively of the Federal national rate.

The Federal rates are determined as follows:

Step 1_Select the appropriate national adjusted standardized amount considering the type of hospital and designation
of the hospital as large urban or other (see Tables 1a and 1b, section V of this addendum).

Step 2_Multiply the labor-related portion of the standardized amount by the applicable wage index for the geographic
area in which the hospital is located (see Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c, section V of this addendum).

Step 3_For hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii, multiply the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount by the
appropriate cost-of-living adjustment factor.

Step 4_Add the amount from Step 2 and the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount (adjusted if appropriate
under Step 3).

Step 5_Multiply the final amount from Step 4 by the relative weight corresponding to the appropriate DRG (see Table
5, section V of this addendum).



2. Hospital-Specific Rate (Applicable Only to Sole Community Hospitals)



Sections 1886(d)(5)(D)(i) and (b)(3)(C) of the Act provide that sole community hospitals are paid based on whichever
of the following rates yields the greatest aggregate payment: the Federal rate, the updated hospital-specific rate
based on FY 1982 cost per discharge, or the updated hospital-specific rate based on FY 1987 cost per discharge.

Hospital-specific rates have been determined for each of these hospitals based on both the FY 1982 cost per discharge
and the FY 1987 cost per discharge. For a more detailed discussion of the calculation of the FY 1982 hospital-specific
rate and the FY 1987 hospital-specific rate, we refer the reader to the September 1, 1983 interim final rule (48 FR 39772);
the April 20, 1990 final rule with comment (55 FR 15150); and the September 4, 1990 final rule (55 FR 35994).

a. Updating the FY 1982 and FY 1987 Hospital-Specific Rates for FY 1995.

 We are proposing to increase the hospital-specific rates by 1.4 percent (the hospital market basket percentage increase
minus 2.2 percentage points) for sole community hospitals located in all areas in FY 1995. Section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii)
of the Act, as amended by Public Law 103-66, provides that the update factor applicable to the hospital-specific
rates for sole community hospitals equals the update factor provided under section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act,
which, for FY 1995, is the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points. Prior to FY 1994, the update to
the hospital specific rates was applied according to a hospital's cost reporting period. However, beginning with
FY 1994, the update to the hospital specific rate is applied on a Federal fiscal year basis under amended section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii).
Section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii) required us to apply the FY 1994 update taking into account the portion of the 12-month
cost reporting period beginning during FY 1993 that occurred during FY 1994. In our September 1, 1993 final rule with
comment (58 FR 46308), we described a methodology for calculating a ``deemed FY 1993'' update which affected payment
rates in FY 1994. Based on public comments, we have revised our interpretion of section 1886(b)(3)(C)(ii) and decided
to prorate the FY 1994 applicable update based on the number of months after the end of a hospital's cost reporting period
that occurred in FY 1994. This revision was outlined in a separate final rule.


b. Calculation of Hospital-Specific Rate.

 For sole community hospitals, the applicable FY 1995 hospital-specific rate would be calculated by multiplying
a hospital's hospital-specific rate for the preceding fiscal year by the applicable update factor (that is, 2.4 percent),
which equals the average update for all prospective system hospitals. In addition, the hospital-specific rate would
be adjusted by the budget neutrality adjustment factor (that is, .997647) as discussed in section II.A.4.b. of this
addendum. This resulting rate would be used in determining under which rate a sole community hospital is paid for its
discharges beginning on or after October 1, 1994, based on the formula set forth above. 



3. General Formula for Calculation of Prospective Payment Rates for Hospitals Located in Puerto Rico Beginning On
or After October 1, 1994 and Before October 1, 1995





a. Puerto Rico Rate. 

The Puerto Rico prospective payment rate is determined as follows: 

Step 1_Select the appropriate adjusted average standardized amount considering the large urban or other designation
of the hospital (see Table 1c, section V of the addendum). 

Step 2_Multiply the labor-related portion of the standardized amount by the appropriate wage index (see Tables 4a
and 4b, section V of the addendum). 

Step 3_Add the amount from Step 2 and the nonlabor-related portion of the standardized amount. 

Step 4_Multiply the result in Step 3 by 75 percent. 

Step 5_Multiply the amount from Step 4 by the appropriate DRG relative weight (see Table 5, section V of the addendum).




b. National Rate.

 The national prospective payment rate is determined as follows: 

Step 1_Multiply the labor-related portion of the national average standardized amount (see Table 1c, section V of
the addendum) by the appropriate wage index. 

Step 2_Add the amount from Step 1 and the nonlabor-related portion of the national average standardized amount. 

Step 3_Multiply the result in Step 2 by 25 percent. 

Step 4_Multiply the amount from Step 3 by the appropriate DRG relative weight (see Table 5, section V of the addendum).


The sum of the Puerto Rico rate and the national rate computed above equals the prospective payment for a given discharge
for a hospital located in Puerto Rico.

III. Proposed Changes to Payment Rates for Inpatient Capital-Related Costs for FY 1995 



The prospective payment system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs was implemented for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991. Effective with that cost reporting period and during a 10-year 
transition period extending through FY 2001, hospital inpatient capital-related costs are paid on the basis of an
increasing proportion of the capital prospective payment system Federal rate and a decreasing proportion of the

historical costs for capital. 

The basic methodology for determining Federal capital prospective rates is set forth at   412.308 through
412.352 of the regulations. Below we discuss the factors that we propose to use to determine the Federal rate and the

hospital-specific rate for FY 1995. The proposed rates would be effective for discharges occurring on or after October
1, 1994. 

We computed the FY 1992 standard Federal payment rate for capital-related costs under the prospective payment system
by updating the FY 1989 Medicare inpatient capital cost per case by an actuarial estimate of the increase in 
Medicare inpatient capital costs per case. Each year after FY 1992 we updated the standard Federal rate for increases
in capital-related costs as provided in  412.308(c)(1). Also,  412.308(c)(2) provides that the Federal
rate is 
adjusted annually by a factor equal to the estimated additional payments under the Federal rate for outlier cases,
determined as a proportion of total capital payments under the Federal rate. For FY 1992 through FY 2001,  412.308(c)(3)
requires that the Federal rate be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments made
for exceptions under  412.348, and  412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the Federal rate be 
adjusted so that the estimated aggregate payments after any changes resulting from the annual DRG reclassification
and the recalibration of DRG weights and changes in the geographic adjustment factor are budget neutral. For FY 1992
through FY 1995,  412.352 requires that the Federal rate also be adjusted by a budget neutrality factor, so that
estimated aggregate payments for inpatient hospital capital costs will equal 90 percent of the estimated payments
that 
would have been made for capital-related costs on a reasonable cost basis during the fiscal year. In addition, Public
Law 103-66 required that, effective for discharges occurring after September 30, 1993, the unadjusted standard
Federal rate be reduced by 7.4 percent.

The hospital-specific rate for each hospital was calculated by dividing the hospital's Medicare inpatient capital-related
costs for a specified base year by its Medicare discharges (adjusted for transfers), and dividing the result by the
hospital's case mix index (also adjusted for transfers). The resulting case-mix adjusted average cost per discharge
was then updated to FY 1992 based on the national average increase in Medicare's inpatient capital 
cost per discharge and adjusted by the exceptions payment adjustment factor and the budget neutrality adjustment
factor to yield the FY 1992 hospital-specific rate. The hospital-specific rate is updated each year after FY 1992

for inflation and for changes in the exceptions payment adjustment factor and the budget neutrality adjustment factor.


To determine the appropriate budget neutrality adjustment factors and the exceptions payment adjustment factor,
we developed a dynamic model of Medicare inpatient capital-related costs, that is, a model that projects changes
in Medicare inpatient capital-related costs over time. The model and its application are described more fully in
Appendix B. 

In accordance with section 1886(d)(9)(A) of the Act, under the prospective payment system for inpatient operating
costs, hospitals located in Puerto Rico are paid under a special payment formula. These hospitals are paid a blended

rate that takes into account their geographical designation and is comprised of 75 percent of the applicable standardized
amount specific to Puerto Rico hospitals and 25 percent of the applicable national average standardized amount.
Section 412.374 provides for the use of this blended payment system for payments to Puerto Rico hospitals under the
prospective payment system for inpatient capital-related costs. Accordingly, for capital-related costs we compute
a separate payment rate specific to Puerto Rico hospitals using the same methodology used to compute the national
Federal rate for capital. Hospitals in Puerto Rico are paid based on 75 percent of the Puerto Rico rate 
and 25 percent of the Federal rate. 



A. Determination of Federal Inpatient Capital-Related Prospective Payment Rate Update 



For FY 1994, the Federal rate was $378.34. With the changes we are proposing to the factors used to establish the Federal
rate, we are proposing that the FY 1995 Federal rate would be $353.87. 

In the discussion that follows, we explain the factors that were used to determine the proposed FY 1994 Federal rate.
In particular, we explain why the FY 1994 Federal rate has decreased 6.47 percent compared to the FY 1993 
Federal rate. We also explain that aggregate payments under the capital proposal are estimated to increase by 2.24
percent. 

The major factor contributing to the decrease in the FY 1994 rate in comparison to FY 1993 is the requirement at  412.352
that estimated payments each year from FY 1992 through FY 1995 for capital costs equal 90 percent of what would have
been payable that year on a reasonable cost basis. Based on the most recent data, we now estimate that capital payments
for FY 1992 were approximately 92.98 percent of reasonable costs, that capital payments for 
FY 1993 were approximately 97.44 percent of reasonable costs, and that capital payments for FY 1994 were approximately
93.05 percent of reasonable costs. The data thus indicate that the budget neutrality adjustments for FY 1992, FY 1993,
and FY 1994 were not sufficient to meet the 90 percent target and that, as a consequence, the Federal rates for both FY
1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 were higher than they should have been. While we do not retroactively adjust the budget neutrality
factor and the Federal rate for previous years to account for revised estimates, we do employ the most recent information

available to refine the budget neutrality adjustment for subsequent years. The result is a lower budget neutrality
adjustment factor for FY 1995 than FY 1994, which is the cause of the decrease in the Federal rate. 

Although the Federal rate for FY 1995 is 6.47 percent lower than the FY 1994 Federal rate, we estimate that total capital
payments per case will increase 2.24 percent in FY 1995. The increase in total payments per case is due to the increase
in the budget neutrality target to equal 90 percent of estimated FY 1994 capital costs per case. Since section 1886(g)(1)(A)
of the Act requires that estimated payments equal 90 percent of estimated reasonable 
costs for capital-related expenses, payments under the capital prospective payment system can be expected to increase
as capital costs per case increase. The increase in payments per case from FY 1994 to FY 1995 (2.24 percent) is less than
the total estimated increase in capital costs per case between FY 1994 and FY 1995 (5.70 percent) because estimated
FY 1994 payments were 3.39 percent higher than the FY 1994 budget neutrality target. As a result, payments must increase
less than the full increase in costs to prevent estimated payments for FY 1995 from exceeding 90 percent of reasonable
cost. Specifically, the increase in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is determined by dividing the increase in cost
per case by the excess of FY 1994 payments over the budget neutrality target (that is, 1.0570/1.0339 = 1.0224, an increase
of 2.24 percent). We discuss the determination of the budget neutrality target in section III.A.3 below. 

Finally, it should be noted that total payments to hospitals under the prospective payment system will be relatively
insensitive to changes in the Federal rate even after the expiration of the budget neutrality provision in 
FY 1996. Since capital payments constitute about 10 percent of hospital payments, a 1 percent change in the Federal
rate yields only about a 0.1 percent change in actual payments to hospitals. 



1. Standard Federal Rate Update 



Section 412.308(c)(1)(i) provides that for FY 1993 through FY 1995, the standard Federal rate is updated on the basis
of a lagged 2-year moving average of the actual increase, adjusted for case-mix index change, in Medicare inpatient
capital-related costs per case for the fiscal years 3 and 4 years before the fiscal year in question. For FY 1995, the
increase is based on the increase in Medicare inpatient capital-related costs per case from FY 1990 through FY 1992.
These are the most recent fiscal years for which cost report data are available. To determine the amount of the increase,
we apportioned a hospital's costs and discharges to each fiscal year based on the number of months in the hospital's
cost reporting period that occurred 
during the applicable fiscal year. Thus, an individual hospital may have more than one cost report included in the
calculation. 

We are proposing that the FY 1995 update factor for the Federal rate be 2.22 percent. The following chart, based on the
December 1993 update of HCRIS, shows how this figure was computed:

<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00126 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

For the final rule, we will recalculate the FY 1995 update factor on the basis of the June 1994 update of HCRIS. 
We note that the effect of the update on the Federal rate is limited by the requirement of budget neutrality until FY
1996. Thus, although the update factor for inflation is 2.22 percent, the FY 1995 Federal rate is lower than the FY 1994
Federal rate because of the effects of the budget neutrality adjustment. We also note that the FY 1995 budget neutrality
target is determined by the estimate of FY 1995 capital costs, not by the 2-year average update factor applied to the
FY 1995 Federal rate. We further discuss the basis for the budget neutrality target in section III.A.4 below. 



2. Outlier Payment Adjustment Factor 



Section 412.312(c) establishes a unified outlier methodology for inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related
costs. A single set of thresholds is used to identify outlier cases for both inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related
payments. Outlier payments are made only on the portion of the Federal rate that is used to calculate the hospital's
inpatient capital-related payments (for example, 40 percent for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995 for
hospitals paid under the fully prospective methodology). Section 412.308(c)(2) provides that the standard Federal
rate for inpatient capital-related costs be reduced by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional payments
under the Federal rate for outlier cases, determined as a proportion of inpatient capital-related payments under
the Federal rate. The outlier thresholds are set so that estimated outlier payments are 5.1 percent of estimated inpatient
operating payments. The inpatient capital-related outlier reduction factor is then set according to the estimated
inpatient capital-related outlier payments that would be made if all hospitals were paid according to 100 percent
of the Federal rate. For purposes of calculating the outlier thresholds and the outlier reduction factor, we model
all hospitals as if paid 100 percent of the Federal rate because, as explained above, outlier payments are made only
on the portion of the Federal rate that is included in the hospital's inpatient capital-related payments. 

In the September 1, 1993 final rule, we estimated that outlier payments for FY 1994 would equal 5.46 percent of inpatient
capital-related payments based on the Federal rate. Accordingly, we applied an outlier adjustment factor of 0.9454
to the Federal rate. Based on the thresholds as set forth in section II.A.4.d of the addendum, we estimate that outlier
payments will equal 6.28 percent of inpatient capital-related payments based on the Federal rate in FY 1995. We are
therefore proposing an outlier adjustment factor of 0.9372 to the Federal rate. When we modeled the combined operating
and capital outlier payments, we found that using a common set of thresholds resulted in a higher percentage of outlier
payments for capital-related costs than for operating costs. We believe the increase in capital-related outlier
payments for FY 1995 results from a combination of the lower proposed capital standard payment amount and the change
to a fixed loss threshold for cost outlier payments. As a result, estimated capital outlier payments for FY 1995 represent
a higher percentage of total capital standard payments than in FY 1994. 

The outlier reduction factors are not built permanently into the rates; that is, they are not applied cumulatively
in determining the Federal rate. Therefore, the net change in the outlier adjustment to the Federal rate for FY 1995
is .9913 (.9372/.9454). Thus, the proposed outlier adjustment would reduce the FY 1995 Federal rate by 0.87 percent
(.9913-1) compared with the FY 1994 outlier adjustment.

3. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor for Changes in DRG 
Weights and the Geographic Adjustment Factor 


Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the Federal 
rate be adjusted so that estimated aggregate payments for 
the fiscal year based on the Federal rate after any changes 
resulting from the annual reclassification and recalibration 
of the DRG weights and changes in the geographic adjustment 
factor equal estimated aggregate payments that would have 
been made on the basis of the Federal rate without such 
changes. We used the actuarial model described in 
Appendix B to estimate the aggregate payments that would 
have been made on the basis of the Federal rate without 
changes in the DRG classifications and weights and in the 
geographic adjustment factor. We also used the model to 
estimate aggregate payments that would be made on the basis 
of the Federal rate as a result of those changes. We then 
used these figures to compute the adjustment required to 
maintain budget neutrality for changes in DRG weights and in 
the geographic adjustment factor. 
For FY 1994, we calculated a GAF/DRG budget neutrality 
factor of 1.0053. In this proposed rule, we are applying a 
factor of 1.00115. The GAF/DRG budget neutrality factors 
are built permanently into the rates; that is, they are 
applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. This 
follows from the requirement that aggregate payments each 
year be no more than it is estimated that they would have 
been in the absence of the changes from the annual DRG 
reclassification and recalibration and in the geographic 
adjustment factor. The incremental change in the adjustment 
from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is 1.00115. 
We note that this factor accounts for DRG 
reclassifications and recalibration and changes in the 
geographic adjustment factor. It also incorporates the 
effects on the geographic adjustment factor of FY 1995 
geographic reclassification decisions made by the MGCRB 
compared to FY 1994 decisions. However, it does not account 
for changes in payments due to changes in the 
disproportionate share and indirect medical education 
adjustment factors or in the large urban add-on. 


4. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor to Assure Aggregate 
Payments Equal 90 Percent of Reasonable Cost Payments 


Section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that 
aggregate payments made each year in FY 1992 through FY 1995 
for hospital inpatient services be reduced in a manner that 
results in payments equal to 90 percent of the amount the 
Secretary estimates would have been payable on a reasonable 
cost basis for inpatient capital-related costs in that year. 
No retroactive increase or decrease is made if aggregate 
payments are greater than or less than 90 percent of actual 
Medicare inpatient capital-related costs for that year. 
Section 412.352 of the regulations provides that HCFA 
determines an adjustment to the hospital-specific rate and 
the Federal rate proportionately, so that the estimated 
payments for capital in each year from FY 1992 through 
FY 1995 will equal 90 percent of what would have been 
payable that year on a reasonable cost basis. The effect of 
this provision is that the reduction required under section 
1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act is realized entirely through a 
reduction in the prospective payments for capital costs 
(that is, no reduction is made for this purpose in the 
reasonable cost payments for old capital) in FY 1992 through 
FY 1995. 
For FY 1994, we determined that a budget neutrality 
factor of 0.8947 was required so that estimated aggregate 
payments for inpatient capital-related costs would equal 90 
percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost 
basis in that year. For FY 1995, we are proposing a budget 
neutrality factor of 0.7986. 
As we explain in Appendix B, we determine the budget 
neutrality adjustment factor on the basis of a projected 
FY 1995 capital costs per case budget neutrality target. We 
develop this target from available data on average Medicare 
capital costs per case for all short-term acute care 
hospitals subject to the capital prospective payment system 
(that is, data from excluded and waiver hospitals were 
eliminated). For the FY 1995 proposed rule, we have actual 
data for FY 1992 from the December 1993 HCRIS update. We 
also have revised estimates of the rates of increase in 
Medicare capital costs per case for the years FY 1993 
through FY 1995. 
At the time of the final rule for FY 1994, we had 
estimated that there would be a 30.53 percent increase in 
Medicare inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and 
FY 1995. In this proposed rule for FY 1995, we estimate 
that there will be a 12.83 percent increase in Medicare 
inpatient capital cost per case between FY 1992 and FY 1994, 
a decline of 13.56 percent (1.1283/1.3053=.8644, or ^13.56 
percent) in the estimated rate of increase since the final 
rule for FY 1995. The following chart shows how the rate-of-increase estimates for FY 1992 through FY 1995 were 
calculated in the final rule for FY 1994 and in this 
proposed rule for FY 1995.

The chart shows the causes of the decline in the rate-of-increase projections since the final rule for FY 1994. 
As the chart shows, the decline in the rate of increase 
projections is due almost entirely to a decline in the rate 
of increase projections for Medicare inpatient capital. (As 
the chart also shows, the rate of increase projections for 
Medicare enrollment, Medicare admissions incidence, and 
Medicare admissions, have changed only marginally.) In 
turn, the decline in the rate of increase projections for 
Medicare inpatient capital is the result of declines in the 
rate of increase projections for total inpatient capital and 
Medicare share. For FY 1993, the panel survey data that we 
use to develop the projected rate of increase for total 
inpatient capital shows a decline in actual interest 
payments compared to FY 1992. We believe that this decline 
in interest payments is due to refinancing of debt 
instruments by hospitals to take advantage of lower interest 
rates. For FY 1994 and FY 1995, we are projecting that 
total inpatient capital cost increases will return to the 
level at which increases for depreciation costs alone have 
been running (i.e., 7-8 percent) as the number of 
refinancings declines. The projection of the rate of 
increase in Medicare share for FY 1993 is similarly grounded 
in panel survey data. The panel survey data for that year 
show that, contrary to our previous assumption, Medicare day 
share has not been increasing in proportion to the increase 
in Medicare admissions. We have accordingly reduced the FY 
1994 and FY 1995 rate of increase projections for Medicare 
share to account for that fact. 
In addition to the decline in the rate of increase 
estimates since the FY 1994 final rule, there has been a 
slight (^0.54 percent) decrease in the FY 1992 cost per case 
in the December 1993 HCRIS data, compared to the June 1993 
HCRIS data that we used for FY 1994. The following chart 
shows the combined effect of the reduced rates of increase 
estimates and the reduced FY 1992 cost per case by comparing 
the projections from FY 1992 to FY 1995 at the time of the 
FY 1994 final rule and in this proposed rule.

The chart shows that the cumulative effect of the 
revised rates of increase is to lower the FY 1994 budget 
neutrality target by 13.56 percent. Together with the 
0.54 percent decline due to updated HCRIS data, this 
accounts for the 14.01 percent reduction in the FY 1995 
capital cost per case budget neutrality target compared to 
the level estimated at the time of the FY 1994 final rule. 
For FY 1994, we employed a budget neutrality factor of 
0.8947 to realize the 90 percent target. In this proposed 
rule for FY 1995, the budget neutrality adjustment factor is 
0.7986. The budget neutrality factors are not built 
permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not 
applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The 
net adjustment to the FY 1994 Federal rate would therefore 
be .7986/.8947 or 0.8926. For the final rule, we will 
recalculate the budget neutrality factor on the basis of the 
most recent data available. 


5. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor 


Section 412.308(c)(3) requires that the standard 
Federal rate for inpatient capital-related costs be reduced 
by an adjustment factor equal to the estimated additional 
payments for exceptions under  412.348 determined as a 
proportion of total payments under the hospital-specific 
rate and Federal rate. The model developed for determining 
the budget neutrality adjustment factor is also used to 
estimate payments under the exceptions payment process and 
to determine the exceptions payment adjustment factor. 
For FY 1994, we estimated that exceptions payments 
would equal 5.15 percent of aggregate payments based on the 
Federal rate and the hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we 
applied an exceptions reduction factor of 0.9485 (1^.0515) 
in determining the Federal rate. For FY 1995, we estimate 
that exceptions payments will equal 2.03 percent of 
aggregate payments based on the Federal rate and the 
hospital-specific rate. Therefore, we propose to apply an 
exceptions reduction factor of 0.9797 (1^.0203) to determine 
the FY 1995 Federal rate. 
The exceptions reductions factors are not built 
permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not 
applied cumulatively in determining the Federal rate. The 
net adjustment to the FY 1995 Federal rate is therefore 
.9797/.9485, or 1.0329. The proposed exceptions reduction 
factor for FY 1995 is thus 3.29 percent higher than the 
factor for FY 1994. 


6. Standard Federal Rate for FY 1995 


For FY 1994, the Federal rate was $378.34. With the 
changes we are proposing to the factors used to establish 
the Federal rate, the FY 1995 Federal rate would be $353.87. 
The proposed changes are as follows: 
 The FY 1995 update factor would be 1.0222. 
 The FY 1995 outlier adjustment factor would be 
0.9372. 
 The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that 
is applied to the standard Federal payment rate for changes 
in the DRG relative weights and in the geographic adjustment 
factor would be 1.00115. 
 The FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor that 
is applied to the standard Federal payment rate and the 
hospital-specific rate to assure that aggregate payments 
equal 90 percent of payments that would have been made on a 
reasonable cost basis would be 0.7986. 
 The FY 1995 exceptions payments adjustment factor 
would be 0.9797. 
Since the Federal rate has already been adjusted for 
differences in case mix, wages, cost of living, indirect 
medical education costs, and payments to hospitals serving a 
disproportionate share of low-income patients, we propose to 
make no additional adjustments in the standard Federal rate 
for these factors other than the budget neutrality factors 
for changes in the DRG relative weights and the geographic 
adjustment factor. 
We are providing a chart that shows how each of the 
factors and adjustments for FY 1995 affected the computation 
of the proposed FY 1995 Federal rate in comparison to the 
FY 1994 Federal rate. The FY 1995 update factor has the 
effect of increasing the Federal rate 2.22 percent compared 
to the rate in FY 1994, while the geographic and DRG budget 
neutrality factor has the effect of increasing the Federal 
rate by 0.12 percent. The FY 1995 exceptions reduction 
factor has the effect of increasing the Federal rate by 3.29 
percent compared to the exceptions reduction for FY 1994. 
The proposed FY 1995 budget neutrality adjustment factor has 
the effect of reducing the final FY 1994 rate by 
10.74 percent compared to the budget neutrality reduction in 
FY 1994. The combined effect of all the proposed changes is 
to decrease the proposed Federal rate by 6.47 percent 
compared to the Federal rate for FY 1994.

We have refined our proposed budget neutrality and 
exceptions reduction factors for FY 1995 on the basis of the 
best available data. We have not retroactively adjusted the 
Federal rate for FY 1994 in determining the rate for 
FY 1995. 


7. Special Rate for Puerto Rico Hospitals 


For FY 1994, the special rate for Puerto Rico hospitals 
was $291.03. With the changes we are proposing to the 
factors used to determine the rate, we are proposing that 
the FY 1995 special rate for Puerto Rico will be $272.20. 


B. Determination of Hospital-Specific Rate Update 


Section 412.328(e) of the regulations provides that the 
hospital-specific rate for FY 1995 be determined by 
adjusting the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate by the 
following factors: 


1. Hospital-Specific Rate Update Factor 


The hospital-specific rate is updated in accordance 
with the update factor for the standard Federal rate 
determined under  412.308(c)(1). For FY 1995, we are 
proposing that the hospital-specific rate be updated by a 
factor of 1.0222. 


2. Exceptions Payment Adjustment Factor 


For FY 1992 through FY 2001, the updated 
hospital-specific rate is multiplied by an adjustment factor 
equal to the estimated additional payments for 
capital-related costs for exceptions under  412.348, 
determined as a proportion of the total amount of payments 
under the hospital-specific rate and the Federal rate. For 
FY 1995, we estimate that exceptions payments will be 
2.03 percent of aggregate payments based on the Federal rate 
and the hospital-specific rate. We therefore propose that 
the updated hospital-specific rate be reduced by a factor of 
0.9797. The exceptions reductions factors are not built 
permanently into the rates; that is, the factors are not 
applied cumulatively in determining the hospital-specific 
rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1995 hospital-specific 
rate is therefore .9797/.9485, or 1.0329. 


3. Budget Neutrality Adjustment Factor 


For FY 1992 through FY 1995, the updated 
hospital-specific rate is adjusted by a budget neutrality 
adjustment factor determined under  412.352, so that 
estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective 
payment system will equal 90 percent of what would have been 
payable on a reasonable cost basis. (The budget neutrality 
adjustment for changes in the DRG relative weights and in 
the geographic adjustment factor is not applied to the 
hospital-specific rate.) For FY 1995, we are proposing a 
budget neutrality factor of 0.7986. The budget neutrality 
factor is not built permanently into the rates; that is, the 
factor is not applied cumulatively in determining the 
hospital-specific rate. The net adjustment to the FY 1995 
hospital-specific rate is therefore .7986/.8947, or 0.8926. 


4. Net Change to Hospital-Specific Rate 


We are providing a chart below to show the proposed net 
change to the hospital-specific rate. The chart shows the 
factors for FY 1994 and FY 1995 and the net adjustment for 
each factor. It also shows that the proposed cumulative net 
adjustment from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is 0.9424, which 
represents a decrease of 5.76 percent to the 
hospital-specific rate. The proposed FY 1995 
hospital-specific rate for each hospital is determined by 
multiplying the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate by the 
cumulative net adjustment of 0.9424.

C. Calculation of Inpatient Capital-Related Prospective Payments for FY 1995 



During the capital prospective payment system transition period, a hospital is paid for the inpatient capital-related
costs under one of two alternative payment methodologies: the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless
methodology. The payment methodology applicable to a particular hospital is determined when a hospital comes under
the prospective payment system for capital-related costs by comparing its hospital-specific rate to the Federal
rate applicable to the hospital's first cost reporting period under the prospective payment system. The applicable
Federal rate is determined by adjusting: 

 For outliers by dividing the standard Federal rate by the outlier reduction factor for that fiscal year; and,


 For the payment adjustment factors applicable to the hospital (that is, the hospital's geographic adjustment
factor, the disproportionate share adjustment factor, and the indirect medical education adjustment factor, when
appropriate). If the hospital-specific rate is above the applicable Federal rate, the hospital is paid under the
hold-harmless methodology. If the hospital-specific rate is below the applicable Federal rate, the hospital is
paid under the fully prospective methodology. For purposes of calculating payments for each discharge under both
the hold-harmless payment methodology and the fully prospective payment methodology, the standard Federal rate
is adjusted as follows: (Standard Federal Rate)  x  (DRG weight)  x  (Geographic Adjustment Factor)  x 
(Large Urban Add-on, if applicable)  x  (COLA adjustment for hospitals located in Alaska and Hawaii)  x 
(1 + Disproportionate Share Adjustment Factor + Indirect Medical Education Adjustment Factor, if applicable).


The result is termed the adjusted Federal rate. 

Payments under the hold-harmless methodology are determined under one of two formulas. A hold-harmless hospital
is paid the higher of: 

 100 percent of the adjusted Federal rate for each discharge; or 

 An old capital payment equal to 85 percent (100 percent for sole community hospitals) of the hospital's allowable
Medicare inpatient old capital costs per discharge for the cost reporting period plus a new capital payment based
on a percentage of the adjusted Federal rate for each discharge. The percentage of the adjusted Federal rate equals
the ratio of the hospital's allowable Medicare new capital costs to its total Medicare inpatient capital-related
costs in the cost reporting period. 

Once a hospital receives payment based on 100 percent of the adjusted Federal rate in a cost-reporting period beginning
on or after October 1, 1994 (or the first cost reporting period after obligated capital that is recognized as old capital
under  412.302(c) is put in use for patient care, if later), the hospital continues to receive capital prospective
payment system payments on that basis for the remainder of the transition period. 

Payment for each discharge under the fully prospective methodology is the sum of:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00135 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The hospital-specific rate multiplied by the DRG relative weight for the discharge and by the applicable hospital-specific
transition blend percentage for the cost reporting period; and 

 The adjusted Federal rate multiplied by the Federal transition blend percentage. 

The blend percentages for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995 are 40 percent of the adjusted Federal rate and
60 percent of the hospital-specific rate. 

Hospitals may also receive outlier payments for those cases that qualify under the thresholds established for each
fiscal year. Section 412.312(c) provides for a single set of thresholds to identify outlier cases for both inpatient
operating and inpatient capital-related payments. Outlier payments are made only on that portion of the Federal
rate that is used to calculate the hospital's inpatient capital-related payments. For fully prospective hospitals,
that will be 40 percent of the Federal rate for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning during FY
1995. Thus, a fully prospective hospital will receive 40 percent of the capital-related outlier payment calculated
for the case for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995. For hold-harmless hospitals
paid 85 percent of their reasonable costs for old inpatient capital, the portion of the Federal rate that is included
in the hospital's outlier payments is based on the hospital's ratio of Medicare inpatient costs for new capital to
total Medicare inpatient capital costs. For hold-harmless hospitals that are paid 100 percent of the Federal rate,
100 percent of the Federal rate is included in the hospital's outlier payments. 

The proposed rules to establish outlier thresholds for FY 1995 are published in section II.A.4.c of the Addendum to
this proposed rule. For FY 1995 we are proposing that a case qualifies as a cost outlier if the cost for the case (after
standardization for the indirect teaching adjustment and disproportionate share adjustment) is greater than the
prospective payment rate for the DRG plus $23,300. We are also proposing that a case qualifies as a day outlier for FY
1995 if the length of stay is greater than the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG plus the lesser of three standard
deviations of the length of stay or 22 days. 

During the capital prospective payment system transition period, any hospital may also receive an additional payment
under an exceptions process if its total inpatient capital-related payments are less than a minimum percentage of
its allowable Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. The minimum payment level is established by class of hospital
under  412.348. The minimum payment levels for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in FY 1995 are:


 Sole community hospitals (located in either an urban or rural area), 90 percent; 

 Urban hospitals with at least 100 beds and a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent
and urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under  412.106(c)(2),
80 percent; and, 


 All other hospitals, 70 percent.

<TEXT>
 

Under  412.348(d), the amount of the exceptions payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments
made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable
to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to that system. Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative
payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable
for a cost reporting period. 

New hospitals are exempted from the capital prospective payment system for their first 2 years of operation and are
paid 85 percent of their reasonable costs during that period. A new hospital's old capital costs are its allowable
costs for capital assets that were put in use for patient care on or before the later of December 31, 1990 or the last day
of the hospital's base year cost reporting period, and are subject to the rules pertaining to old capital and obligated
capital as of the applicable date. Effective with the third year of operation, we will pay the hospital under either
the fully prospective methodology, using the appropriate transition blend in that Federal fiscal year, or the hold-harmless
methodology. If the hold-harmless methodology is applicable, the hold-harmless payment for assets in use during
the base period would extend for 8 years, even if the hold-harmless payments extend beyond the normal transition period.




IV. Proposed Rate-of-Increase Percentages for Hospitals and Hospital Units Excluded From the Prospective Payment
System 



The inpatient operating costs of hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment system are subject
to rate-of-increase limits established under the authority of section 1886(b) of the Act, which is implemented in
 413.40 of the regulations. Under these limits, an annual target amount (expressed in terms of the inpatient
operating cost per discharge) is set for each hospital, based on the hospital's own historical cost experience trended
forward by the applicable rate-of-increase percentages (update factors). The target amount is multiplied by the
number of Medicare discharges in a hospital's cost reporting period, yielding the ceiling on aggregate Medicare
inpatient operating costs for the cost reporting period. 

Effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991, a hospital that has Medicare inpatient
operating costs in excess of its ceiling is paid its ceiling plus 50 percent of its costs in excess of the ceiling. Total
payment may not exceed 110 percent of the ceiling. A hospital that has inpatient operating costs less than its ceiling
will continue to be paid its costs plus the lower of_

 Fifty percent of the difference between the inpatient operating costs and the ceiling; or 

 Five percent of the ceiling. 

Each hospital's target amount is adjusted annually, at the beginning of its cost reporting period, by an applicable
rate-of-increase percentage. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993 and before October
1, 1994, section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act provides that the applicable rate-of-increase percentage is the market
basket percentage increase minus the lesser of one percentage point or the percentage point difference between 10
percent and the hospital's ``update adjustment percentage'' except for hospitals with an ``update adjustment percentage''
of at least 10 percent. The rate-of-increase percentage for hospitals in the latter case will be the market basket
percentage increase. The ``update adjustment percentage'' is the percentage by which a hospital's allowable inpatient
operation costs exceeds the hospital's ceiling for the cost reporting period beginning in Federal fiscal year 1990.
For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1994 and before October 1, 1997, the update adjustment
percentage is the update adjustment percentage from the previous year plus the previous year's applicable reduction.
The applicable reduction and applicable percentage are then determined in the same manner as for FY 1994. The most
recent forecasted market basket increase for FY 1995 for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the prospective
payment system is 3.7 percent.

Appendix A_Regulatory Impact Analysis 
I. Introduction 


We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)(5
U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all hospitals to be small entities.

Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis for any proposed rule
that may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. With the exception of hospitals located in certain New England
counties, for purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than
100 beds that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or New England County Metropolitan Area. 
Section 601(g) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98-21) designated hospitals in certain New
England counties as belonging to the adjacent New England County Metropolitan Area. Thus, for purposes of the prospective
payment system, we classified these hospitals as urban hospitals. 
It is clear that the changes being proposed in this document would affect both a substantial number of small rural hospitals
as well as other classes of hospitals, and the effects on some may be significant. Therefore, the discussion below,
in combination with the rest of this proposed rule, constitutes a combined regulatory impact analysis and regulatory
flexibility analysis. 


II. Objectives 


The primary objective of the prospective payment system is to create incentives for hospitals to operate efficiently
and minimize unnecessary costs and at the same time ensure that payments are sufficient to adequately compensate
hospitals for their legitimate costs. In addition, we share national goals of deficit reduction and restraints on
government spending in general. 
We believe the proposed changes would further each of these goals while maintaining the financial viability of the
hospital industry and ensuring access to high quality care for beneficiaries. We expect that these proposed changes
would ensure that the outcomes of this payment system are, in general, reasonable and equitable while avoiding or
minimizing unintended adverse consequences. 


III. Limitations of Our Analysis 


As has been the case in previously published regulatory impact analyses, the following quantitative analysis presents
the projected effects of our proposed policy changes, as well as statutory changes effective for FY 1995, on various
hospital groups. We estimate the effects of each policy change by estimating payments while holding all other payment
variables constant. We use the best data available, but we do not attempt to predict behavioral responses to our policy
changes, and we do not make adjustments for future changes in such variables as admissions, lengths of stay, or case
mix. 
As we have done in previous proposed rules, we are soliciting comments and information about the anticipated effects
of these changes on the prospective payment system, and our methodology for estimating them. 


IV. Hospitals Included In and Excluded From the Prospective Payment System 


The prospective payment systems for hospital inpatient operating and capital-related costs encompass nearly all
general, short-term, acute care hospitals that participate in the Medicare program. We have included in our analysis
only hospitals paid under these systems. There were 47 Indian Health Service Hospitals in our database, which we excluded
from the analysis due to the special characteristics of the payment method for these hospitals. Only 55 short-term,
acute care hospitals remain excluded from the prospective payment system under section 1814(b)(3) of the Act (in
Maryland) or a demonstration project (in the Finger Lakes region of New York State). Thus, as of April 1994, just over
5,200 hospitals were receiving prospectively based payments for furnishing inpatient services. This represents
about 81 percent of all Medicare-participating hospitals. The majority of this impact analysis focuses on this set
of hospitals. 
The remaining 19 percent are specialty hospitals that are excluded from the prospective payment system and continue
to be paid on the basis of their reasonable costs, subject to a rate-of-increase ceiling on their inpatient operating
costs per discharge. These hospitals include psychiatric, rehabilitation, long-term care, children's hospitals,
and cancer hospitals. The impacts of our proposed policy changes on these hospitals is discussed below. 


V. Impact on Excluded Hospitals and Units 


As of April 1994, just under 2,000 specialty hospitals are excluded from the prospective payment system and are instead
paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to the rate-of-increase ceiling under  413.40. In addition, 1,932 psychiatric
and rehabilitation units in hospitals that are subject to the prospective payment system and 9 hospitals extensively
involved either in the treatment of cancer or in cancer research are also excluded from the prospective payment system
and paid in accordance with  413.40. 
In accordance with section 13502 of Public Law 103-66, the update factor applicable to the rate-of-increase
limit for excluded hospitals and units for FY 1995 would be the hospital market basket minus 1.0 percentage point,
adjusted to account for the relationship between the hospital's allowable operating cost per case and its target
amounts. We are projecting an increase in the excluded hospital market basket of 3.7 percent. 
The impact on excluded hospitals and units of the proposed update in the rate-of-increase limit depends on the cumulative
cost increases experienced by each excluded hospital and excluded unit since its applicable base period. For excluded
hospitals and units that have maintained their cost increases at a level below the percentage increases in the rate-of-increase
limits since their base period, the major effect will be on the level of incentive payments these hospitals and units
receive. Conversely, for excluded hospitals and units with per-case cost increases above the cumulative update
in their rate-of-increase limit, the major effect will be the amount of excess costs that the hospitals would have
to absorb.

<TEXT>
 

In this context, we note that  413.40(d)(3) allows an excluded hospital or unit whose costs exceed the rate-of-increase
limit to receive the lower of its rate-of-increase ceiling plus 50 percent of reasonable costs in excess of the ceiling,
or 110 percent of its ceiling. In addition, under the various provisions set forth in  413.40, excluded hospitals
and units can obtain substantial relief from the rate-of-increase limit for significant, yet justifiable, increases
in operating costs that exceed the limit. At the same time, however, by generally limiting payment increases to the
growth rate in the hospital market basket, we continue to provide an incentive for excluded hospitals and units to
restrain the growth in their spending for patient services. 
In this proposed rule, we would establish new exclusion criteria for long-term care hospitals that define a minimum
level of independence a new hospital must have to qualify for exclusion from the prospective payment system (see section
VI.A. of the preamble). We anticipate that this change would slow the proliferation of such hospitals in the future.
The likely result of this change is that some patients who might otherwise have been treated in long-term care hospitals
that are excluded from the prospective payment system will instead be treated in prospective payment hospitals.
Thus, their care will be paid for under the prospective payment system rather than under the TEFRA provisions of section
1886(b) of the Act. Although we cannot quantify the impact of this change on Medicare payments to hospitals, we anticipate
that it would result in a small decrease in aggregate payment levels. 
We are proposing to remove from the regulations the ``1986 malpractice rule'' as explained in section VI.B of the preamble.
This proposal is a technical change that is necessary to conform the codified Medicare regulations to the various
authorities that have previously established that the malpractice rule is invalid. This proposed conforming change
would not, standing alone, have significant economic effects. 


VI. Quantitative Impact Analysis of the Proposed Policy Changes Under Prospective Payment System for Operating
Costs 


A. Basis and Methodology of Estimates 


In this proposed rule, we are announcing policy changes and payment rate updates for the prospective payment systems
for operating and capital-related costs. We have prepared separate analyses of the proposed changes to each system,
beginning with changes to the operating prospective payment system. 
The data used in developing the quantitative analyses presented below are taken from the FY 1993 MedPAR file and the
most current provider-specific file that is used for payment purposes. Although the analyses of the changes to the
operating prospective payment system do not incorporate any actual cost data, the most recently available hospital
cost report data were used to create some of the variables by which hospitals are categorized. Our analysis has several
qualifications. First, we do not make adjustments for behavioral changes that hospitals may adopt in response to
these proposed policy changes. Second, due to the interdependent nature of the prospective payment system, it is
very difficult to precisely quantify the impact associated with each proposed change. Third, we draw upon various
sources for the data used to categorize hospitals in the tables. In some cases, particularly the number of beds, there
is a fair degree of variation in the data from different sources. We have attempted to construct these variables with
the best available source overall. For individual hospitals, however, some miscategorizations are possible. 
The simulations estimate total payments under the operating prospective payment system given various combinations
of payment parameters. Any short-term, acute care hospitals not paid under the general prospective payment systems
(Indian Health Service Hospitals, hospitals in the New York Finger Lakes demonstration project, and hospitals in
Maryland) are excluded from the simulations. Payments under the capital prospective payment system, or payments
for costs other than inpatient operating costs, are not estimated here. Estimated payment impacts of proposed FY
1995 changes to the capital prospective payment system are discussed later in this impact analysis. 
The proposed changes discussed separately below are the following: 
 The effects of eliminating the separate rural standardized amount by setting it equal to the other urban amount,
as required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act. 
 The effects of the annual reclassification of diagnoses and procedures and the recalibration of the DRG relative
weights required by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act. 
 The effects of changes in hospitals' wage index values reflecting the FY 1991 wage data. 
 The effects of changing the transfer payment policy to a graduated per diem and revising the definition of transfers
to include cases going from hospitals or units paid under the prospective payment system to hospitals or units that
are excluded from the prospective payment system. 
 The effects of geographic reclassifications by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board that
are effective in FY 1995. 
 The effects of phasing out payments for extraordinarily lengthy cases (day outlier cases) by 25 percent (with
a corresponding increase in payments for extraordinarily costly cases (cost outliers)) and establishing a fixed-loss
threshold for cost outliers, in accordance with section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66, as well as the effects
of increasing the marginal cost factor applicable to cost outlier payments from 75 to 80 percent. 
 The total change in payments based on estimated FY 1995 total payments relative to estimated FY 1994 total payments.

To illustrate the impacts of the FY 1995 proposed changes, our FY 1995 baseline simulation model uses: the FY 1994 GROUPER
(version 11.0); wage indexes based on FY 1990 wage data; the current transfer payment policy; no effects of FY 1995
reclassifications; and current outlier policy. To illustrate the effects of eliminating the rural standardized
amount, the rural amount in the FY 1995 baseline is updated by the same update applied to the urban amounts (1.1 percent),
to maintain the current differential. The FY 1995 baseline also includes the higher disproportionate share hospital
(DSH) payments as described above and the elimination of the special protection for Medicare-dependent, small rural
hospitals (MDHs). Outliers are estimated to be 5.1 percent of total DRG payments. 
Each policy change is then added incrementally to this baseline, finally arriving at an FY 1995 model incorporating
all of the proposed changes. This analysis then compares the percent changes in payments per case due to each change.
This allows us to isolate the effects of each change from the overall change in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. 
Several policy changes that would occur during FY 1995 are not modeled separately but are shown as combined changes
from FY 1994 to FY 1995. These changes are: 
 The proposed update factor applied to the standardized amounts (other than the differential update to the
rural amount that is modeled in Column 1).

 Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, section 1886(d)(5)(F)(vii)(I)(d) of the
Act requires an increase in the DSH payment adjustment to urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and for rural hospitals
with 500 or more beds, that have a DSH patient percentage greater than 20.2.
 The special payment protection for MDHs is not applicable after FY 1994. (Section 1886(d)(5)(G)(i) of the
Act as amended by section 13501(e) of Pub. L. 103-66). 
Finally, when comparing our estimated FY 1994 payments to FY 1995 payments, another significant consideration is
that we currently estimate that outlier payments during FY 1994 will be 4.0 percent of total DRG payments. When the
FY 1994 final rules were published September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46270), we estimated FY 1994 outlier payments would be 5.1
percent of total DRG payments. The effects of the lower than expected outlier payments during FY 1994 are reflected
in the analyses below comparing our current estimates of FY 1994 total payments to estimated FY 1995 payments.
Finally, we also compare the changes in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. In this comparison, our FY 1994 baseline reflects
payment policies during the current year. The FY 1995 simulation similarly reflects the combination of the statutory
and proposed changes to go into effect during FY 1995.
Table I demonstrates the results of our analysis. The table categorizes hospitals by various geographic and special
payment consideration groups to illustrate the varying impacts on different types of hospitals. The top row of the
table shows the overall impact on the 5,248 hospitals included in the analysis. This is 54 fewer hospitals than were
included in the impact analysis in the FY 1994 final rule (58 FR 46270). (Data for 80 hospitals that were included in
last year's analysis were not available for analysis this year; however, data were available this year for 26 hospitals
for which data were not available last year.) The next four rows of Table I contain hospitals categorized according
to their geographic location (all urbans as well as large urban and other urban or rural). There are 2,947 hospitals
located in urban areas (MSAs) included in our analysis. Among these, there are 1,616 hospitals located in large urban
areas (populations over 1 million), and 1,331 hospitals in other urban areas (populations of 1 million or fewer).
In addition, there are 2,301 hospitals in rural areas. The next two groupings are by bed size categories, shown separately
for urban and rural hospitals. The final groupings by geographic location are by census divisions, also shown separately
for urban and rural hospitals.
The second part of Table I shows changes in payments based on hospitals' FY 1995 payment classifications, including
any reclassifications under sections 1886(d)(10) of the Act. For example, the rows labeled urban, large urban, other
urban, and rural, show the numbers of hospitals being paid based on these categorizations, after consideration of
geographic reclassifications, are 3,252, 1,830, 1,422, and 1,996, respectively.
The next three groupings examine the impacts of the proposed changes on hospitals grouped by whether or not they have
residency programs (teaching hospitals that receive an indirect medical education (IME) adjustment), receive
DSH payments, or some combination of these two adjustments. There are 4,197 nonteaching hospitals in our analysis,
829 with fewer than 100 residents, and 222 with 100 or more residents.
In the DSH categories, hospitals are grouped according to their DSH payment status based on how they will be paid during
FY 1995. That is, hospitals located in rural counties that have been reclassified as urban by the MGCRB for purposes
of assigning the standardized amount are categorized here as urban, since they are considered urban in determining
the amount of their DSH adjustment. The rural DSH hospitals, therefore, including those in the rural referral center
and sole community hospital categories, represent hospitals that were not reclassified for purposes of the standardized
amount. The next category groups hospitals paid on the basis of the urban standardized amount in terms of whether they
receive the IME adjustment, the DSH adjustment, both, or neither.
The next six rows examine the impacts of the proposed changes on rural hospitals by special payment groups (sole community
hospitals, rural referral centers, and MDHs). Rural hospitals reclassified for FY 1995 for purposes of the standardized
amount are not included here with the exception of the MDH row. This row includes all hospitals that were paid under
the MDH provision during FY 1994 in order to isolate the impact of ending this provision. Of the 415 hospitals shown
in this row, 3 are located in a county now designated as urban under the 1993 MSA definitions, and 39 others have been
reclassified for either the standardized amount, the wage index, or both.
The rural referral centers (138), sole community hospitals (578), and rural referral center/sole community hospitals
(54) shown here were not reclassified for purposes of the standardized amount. There are 19 rural referral centers
and 27 sole community hospitals that would be reclassified for the standardized amount in FY 1995 and are therefore
not included in these columns. In addition, one hospital that is both a rural referral center and a sole community hospital
will be reclassified for the standardized amount.
The next two groupings are based on type of ownership and the hospital's Medicare utilization expressed as a percent
of total patient days. These data are taken from the Medicare cost report files, the latest available being FY 1992.
Data needed to calculate Medicare utilization percentages were unavailable for 66 hospitals. For the most part,
these are either new hospitals or hospitals filing manual cost reports that are not yet entered into the data base.
The next series of groupings concern the geographic reclassification status of hospitals. The first three rows display
hospitals that were reclassified by the MGCRB for either FY 1994 or FY 1995, or for both years. One effect of eliminating
the separate rural standardized amount in FY 1995 is to reduce the number of standardized amount reclassifications.
The next rows illustrate the overall number of reclassifications, as well as the numbers of reclassified hospitals
grouped by urban and rural location. The final row in Table I contains hospitals located in rural counties but deemed
to be urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act.

B. The Elimination of the Separate Rural Standardized Amount (Column 1) 




Section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act provides that, beginning in FY 1995, the rural standardized amount is equal to the
other urban standardized amount. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act, as amended by section 13501(a)(1) of Public
Law 103-66, provides that the update to the urban standardized amounts for FY 1995 will equal the market basket
rate of increase minus 2.5 percentage points, and the update to the rural standardized amount is the amount necessary
to set the rural amount equal to the other urban amount. We project the market basket increase to be 3.6 percent, so the
proposed update to the large and other urban standardized amounts is 1.1 percent and the proposed update to the rural
standardized amount is 8.4 percent (the market basket rate of increase of 3.6 percent plus 4.8 percent). 


The process undertaken to set the rural amount equal to the other urban amount, as well as the overall methodology used
to determine the FY 1995 proposed standardized payment amounts, is described in the Addendum to this proposed rule.
As described there, the net increase in rural hospitals' FY 1995 standardized payment amount compared to FY 1994 is
less than 8.4 percent. The difference between the proposed FY 1995 payment rate for rural hospitals and their FY 1994
amount is 4.6 percent. This smaller net increase can be attributed to changing from separate urban and rural outlier
offsets (applicable to the previously separate rates) to a single offset after the rural rate is eliminated. 


To illustrate, for FY 1994, the difference between the other urban and rural final standardized amounts was 3.0 percent.
These amounts reflected the differential outlier adjustment factors applied to the urban and rural standardized
amounts of 0.945960 and 0.977157, respectively (See the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46349.) Similarly, section
1886(d)(8)(D) of the Act necessitated different urban and rural budget neutrality factors for geographic reclassification.
Removing these differential adjustments from the FY 1994 standardized amounts, and updating the urban amounts by
1.1 percent, increases the difference between the other urban and rural amounts from 3.0 percent to 8.4 percent. 


Section 1886(d)(3)(B) requires the Secretary to adjust both the large urban and other national standardized amounts
by the same outlier adjustment factor beginning in FY 1995. Estimated outlier payments equal 5.1 percent of estimated
total DRG payments, so a 5.1 percent offset is applied to the standardized amounts. For FY 1994, the rural outlier offset
was 2.3 percent, 2.8 percent smaller than the 5.1 percent offset for FY 1995. For FY 1995, the increase in the size of
the outlier offset for rural hospitals reduces the effect of the higher standardized amount. 


The FY 1995 baseline employs differential outlier offsets to the separate urban and rural amounts. The net difference
between the rural and other urban amounts after applying these differential offsets to the FY 1995 baseline rates
(without any of the other budget neutrality factors) is 4.3 percent. Because the urban amount increases by 0.3 percent
when the 5.1 national outlier offset is applied rather than the larger urban outlier offset, the net increase in the
rural standardized amount to bring it up to the other urban amount is 4.6 percent. 


Finally, in addition to equating the other urban and rural amounts through a higher rural update and a single outlier
offset, a national labor share (the portion of the standardized amounts adjusted by the wage index) is necessary to
maintain the elimination of the separate amounts. For FY 1994, the rural labor share represents 75.6 percent of the
rural standardized amount, while the urban labor share comprises about 70.8 percent of the large and other urban amounts.
For FY 1995, we are proposing to determine the labor portion of the standardized amounts based on a national average
labor share of 71.4 percent. 


Column 1 displays the payment changes resulting from eliminating the rural amount, modeled by comparing payments
simulated using our FY 1995 baseline model described earlier to simulated payments after eliminating the separate
rural amount. The impacts of the higher update to the standardized amount for rural hospitals are evident. Overall,
hospitals located in rural counties experience a 2.9 percent increase in payments from this change, compared to a
0.4 percent rise in payments to urban hospitals. Nationally, payments per case are estimated to rise 0.7 percent as
a result of this change. 


The 2.9 percent increase for hospitals in rural areas is below the 4.6 percent increase in the standardized amount
for several reasons. First, this row includes all hospitals that are located in rural areas, but some rural hospitals
receive a higher urban payment rate. This is reflected in the ``Rural Hospital Types'' rows. Rural referral centers
(RRCs) have only a 0.2 percent payment effect resulting from this change. These hospitals currently receive the other
urban amount and, therefore, do not gain directly from the elimination of the rural amount. They do apparently benefit
slightly from the smaller outlier offset applied to the urban standardized amounts. Another rural hospital group
experiencing only a relatively small impact from this change is sole community hospitals (SCHs). Their payments
rise 1.8 percent, well below that for most other rural hospital groups. Because these hospitals are paid based on the
greater of their applicable Federal rate or their hospital-specific rate, increasing the Federal rate has an impact
upon only those SCHs that would be paid based on that rate. Of the 578 SCHs in this row, 435 are paid on the basis of their
hospital-specific rate in our FY 1995 baseline model. When the rural amount is eliminated by making it equal to the
other urban amount, only 66 SCHs switch from their hospital-specific rate to the Federal rate. This explains the below
average payment change compared to other rural hospitals. 


Conversely, nonspecial status rural hospitals, and rural hospitals receiving DSH all experience above average
payment gains (between 5.7 percent and 6.0 percent). This effect appears to be primarily attributable to the decrease
in the labor share of the standardized amount. In fact, substituting the current higher rural labor share on both models
in this comparison reduces the payment gains for these hospital groups to 4.6 percent (except for MDHs, which fall
to 4.4 percent).

The row demonstrating the largest benefit from this change is rural Puerto Rico, with an 18.0 percent increase. This
stems from the calculation of separate payment rates for Puerto Rico's hospitals, which are equal to 75 percent of
the Puerto Rico rate plus 25 percent of the discharge-weighted average of the urban and rural national prospective
payment system rates. For FY 1994, for example, the Puerto Rico rate for other urban areas was 26.6 percent greater
than the Puerto Rico rural rate. The increase in the national Puerto Rico amount is much smaller, however, so that the
payment effect is less than the full increase in the rural Puerto Rico rate. Urban hospitals in Puerto Rico also receive
an added increase in payments above those of other urban hospitals, due to the higher national portion. It is far below
the rural Puerto Rico increase, however. 


For urban hospitals nationally, the change in payments is slightly above the percentage change in the outlier offsets
when moving to a single 5.1 percent offset. The FY 1994 urban outlier adjustment factor was 0.945960, which results
in a 5.404 percent offset. To lower the offset to 5.1 percent, an adjustment factor of 0.949 is applied to the standardized
amounts. The difference between these two factors is 0.3 percent. The increase in the labor share also has a generally
favorable impact on urban hospitals due to their above average wage index values. 


Eliminating the separate rural amount also has the effect of redistributing outlier payments, primarily due to the
higher standardized amount paid to rural hospitals. The average rural outlier payment per case falls by 3.0 percent
after eliminating the separate rural amount, and the average urban outlier payment per case rises by 0.4 percent.
This occurs because fewer rural cases qualify for outlier payments due to the higher DRG payments per case; thus, the
outlier thresholds must be revised to maintain the outlier pool at 5.1 percent of total DRG and outlier payments. This
leads to additional outlier payments going to outlier cases in urban hospitals. 


The fact that many of these cases are also in teaching hospitals and DSH hospitals leads to what we consider an anomalous
impact on total payments. Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act, we set outlier payment policies so that
estimated outlier payments are 5.1 percent of estimated total DRG payments. Under the statute, estimated outlier
payments do not encompass IME and DSH payments made for outlier cases. The amounts of IME and DSH payments are affected
by the level of outlier payments so a redistribution of outlier payments to teaching and DSH hospitals has the effect
of generating a net increase in total payments. 




C. The Impact of the Proposed Changes to the DRG Weights (Column 2) 




In column 2 of Table I, we present the combined effects of the revised DRG classification system, and the subsequent
recalibration of the DRG weights incorporating these revised DRGs, as discussed in section II of the preamble to this
proposed rule. Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(i) of the Act requires us each year to make appropriate classification changes
and to recalibrate the DRG weights in order to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and any other factors
that may change the relative use of hospital resources. The impact of reclassification and recalibration on aggregate
payments is required by section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of the Act to be budget neutral. 


The first row of Table I shows that the overall effect of these proposed changes is budget neutral. That is, the percentage
change when adding the proposed FY 1995 GROUPER (version 12.0) to the FY 1995 baseline is 0.0. Since the changes illustrated
in the columns of Table I are cumulative, this column reflects the elimination of the separate rural amount in both
simulations. Only the version of the GROUPER is different. 


Consistent with the minor changes we are proposing for the FY 1995 GROUPER, the redistributional impacts across hospital
groups are very small (an increase of 0.1 for urban hospitals and a decrease of 0.1 for rural hospitals). Among other
hospital categories, the net effects are slightly negative changes for small hospitals and slightly positive changes
for larger hospitals. The largest single effect on any of the hospital categories examined is a 0.3 percent decrease
in payments for rural DSH hospitals with fewer than 100 beds.

D. The Impact of Updating the Wage Data (Column 3) 


Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that, beginning October 1, 1993, we annually update the wage data used to
calculate the wage index. In accordance with this requirement, the wage index for FY 1995 is based on data submitted
for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1990 and before October 1, 1991. 
As with the previous two columns, the impact of the new data on hospital payments is isolated by holding the other payment
parameters constant in the two simulations. That is, the table shows the percentage changes in payments when going
from our FY 1995 baseline_using the FY 1994 wage index before geographic reclassifications based on 1990 wage survey
data, eliminating the separate rural rate and incorporating the FY 1995 GROUPER_to a model substituting the FY 1995
pre-reclassification wage index based on 1991 data as described above. 
Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act also requires that any updates or adjustments to the wage index be made in a manner
that ensures that aggregate payments to hospitals are not affected by the change in the wage index. To comply with the
requirements that the DRG and wage index changes must be implemented in a budget neutral manner, we compute a budget
neutrality adjustment factor to apply to the standardized amounts. For the FY 1995 proposed amounts, this adjustment
factor is 0.997647. This factor is applied to the standardized amounts in this column to ensure that the overall effect
of the wage index changes are budget neutral. 
The results indicate that the new wage data do not have a significant overall impact on urban and rural hospitals. As
discussed in section III of the preamble to this proposed rule, 86.4 percent of all prospective payment system hospitals
would experience a change in their wage index of less than 5 percent. This column demonstrates that hospitals with
significant changes in their wage indexes are not concentrated within any particular hospital group. In contrast,
the impact analysis of the final FY 1994 operating prospective payment system changes displayed numerous hospital
groups with payment changes in excess of 2.0 percent due to the new wage survey data (58 FR 46459). For FY 1995, some of
the largest changes are evident among urban hospitals grouped by census division. New England urban hospitals' payments
rise 1.0 percent, while payments per case for urban hospitals in the West North Central and Mountain census divisions
fall by 1.1 percent. The most dramatic shifts occur in Puerto Rico, where payments decline by 10.7 percent in rural
hospitals and 7.7 percent in urban hospitals. These effects are attributable to data corrections. We note that the
FY 1994 payment effect of the new wage data was an 11.6 percent increase for rural Puerto Rico hospitals. 
This decline in the wage index values for Puerto Rico hospitals also appears to be the main cause for the 0.6 percent
drop in payments among proprietary hospitals. The 20 hospitals with the greatest drop in their wage index within this
category are all located in Puerto Rico. Also experiencing a 0.6 percent decline in payments per case are hospitals
in rural counties deemed to be urban under section 1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act. This impact appears to be primarily related
to 2 hospitals experiencing nearly 20 percent declines in their wage index values.

E. Transfer Changes (Column 4) 


In column 4 of Table I, the impacts of the changes we are proposing in transfer payment policy are shown. These changes
would revise our methodology for payment for transfer cases under the prospective payment system to more appropriately
compensate transferring hospitals for the higher costs they incur, on average, on the first day of a hospital stay
prior to transfer. Our current transfer policy pays a flat per diem amount for each day prior to transfer up to the full
DRG amount. The per diem is calculated by dividing the amount that would be paid for a patient assigned to the same DRG
who is discharged from the hospital, and dividing that amount by the geometric mean length of stay for that DRG. Our
proposal is to replace this flat per diem methodology with a graduated methodology that would pay twice the per diem
amount for the first day, and the per diem amount for each day beyond the first. 
In addition, we are proposing to expand our definition of transfer cases to include patients transferred from a hospital
or unit paid under the prospective payment system to a hospital or unit excluded from the prospective payment system.
Currently, these case are considered to be discharges. Under this proposed change, these cases would be paid in accordance
with our transfer policy, including the proposed change to the graduated payment methodology described above. 
The payment impacts shown in column 4 illustrate the combined effects of these two changes, relative to the baseline
simulation based on current policy (a flat per diem transfer payment methodology and cases transferred to excluded
hospitals and units are paid as discharges). In order to simulate the effects of the proposed changes, it was necessary
to identify current transfer cases, as well as current discharges going to an excluded hospital or unit. Current transfers
are identifiable by the discharge destination code on the patient bill (see ``Transfers of Medicare Hospital Patients
Under the Prospective Payment System'', RAND, PM-191-HCFA, January 1994, for a thorough discussion
of identifying transfer cases on the MedPAR file). 
Next, to determine whether payment would be made under the per diem methodology, we compared the actual length of stay
prior to transfer to the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG to which the case is assigned. A full discharge or a
transfer case that received the full discharge payment would be counted as 1.0, while, under our current transfer
policy, a transfer case that stayed 2 days in a DRG with a geometric mean length of stay of 5 days would count as 0.4 of a
discharge. To determine the transfer adjustment factor, we then added together these adjusted discharges and divided
by total discharges, including transfers. In this manner, transfer cases are counted only to the extent that the transferring
hospital received payment for them. To simulate our proposed change to the per diem payment methodology, we added
1 day to the actual length of stay for transfer cases, thereby replicating paying double the per diem for the first stay
and the flat per diem, up to the full DRG amount, for subsequent days. 
Finally, we calculated transfer-adjusted case-mix indexes for each hospital. The adjusted case-mix indexes are
calculated by summing the transfer-adjusted DRG weights and dividing by the transfer-adjusted number of cases.
The transfer-adjusted DRG weights are calculated by multiplying the DRG weight by the lesser of 1 or the fraction of
the length of stay for the case divided by the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG. By adjusting the DRG weights,
nontransfer cases and transfer cases that have a length of stay at least as long as the geometric mean length of stay
will be represented by the full DRG weight, while transfer cases with lengths of stay below the geometric mean length
of stay for the DRG will be represented by a lower number, reflective of their payment. 
The FY 1995 baseline model reflected in columns 1 through 3 incorporates transfer-adjusted discharges and case-mix
indexes based on current law. That is, cases transferred prior to reaching the geometric mean length of stay received
payments based on the flat per diem and cases discharged to excluded hospitals and units received the full DRG amount.
In column 4, our model substitutes transfer-adjusted discharges and case-mix indexes that reflect our proposed
policy changes. 
The first row in column 4 shows that the net effect of our proposed changes is budget neutral compared to total payments
under current transfer policy. RAND estimated the number of transfers under the prospective payment system during
FY 1991 to be about 230,000. Our analysis indicates that, applying current policy, the number of cases during FY 1993
counted as discharges to excluded hospitals or units is approximately 190,000. Our preliminary analysis indicates
that these latter cases are more likely to be surgical cases, and thus are more expensive on average than cases that
are currently defined as transfers. Thus, redefining discharges to excluded hospitals as transfers and paying them
accordingly generates savings sufficient to offset the higher per diem payments for the first day of all transfer
cases.

The distributional effects of theses changes are to increase payments to rural hospitals by 0.5 percent and decrease
urban hospitals' payments by 0.1 percent (that is, ^0.2 percent for large urban and ^0.1 percent for other urban).
Rural hospitals clearly benefit from changing the per diem payment methodology. RAND found that rural hospitals
as a whole transfer 4.5 percent of their patients, compared to 1.7 percent in large urban hospitals and 1.6 percent
in other urban hospitals. Therefore, one would expect rural hospitals to benefit disproportionately from the change
to the per diem payment methodology. 


The impact on small hospitals is also positive, consistent with RAND's finding that hospitals with fewer than 50 beds
transfer 6.1 percent of their cases, and hospitals with 50 to 99 beds transfer 4.9 percent of cases. These groups also
benefit relative to larger hospitals. Rural hospitals with fewer than 50 beds receive a 0.9 percent increase in per
case payments, and rural hospitals with 50 to 99 beds receive a 0.6 percent increase. Urban hospitals with fewer than
100 beds experience a 0.3 percent rise in payments. Among rural hospital groups, SCHs and current MDHs realize increases
of 0.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively. 


Due to the much larger proportion of overall payments that go to urban hospitals, a smaller percentage change in their
payments is enough to offset the higher payments going to hospitals that send out a relatively higher percentage of
transfers. The reduction in payments for urban hospitals comes from the proposed change in the definition of transfers
to include cases going to excluded hospitals and units, as well as other hospital settings such as Veterans Administration
hospitals and nonparticipating hospitals. The hospital group with the largest single negative impact is the ``Unknown''
Medicare utilization category, a 0.6 percent decline. This is primarily due to two or three hospitals with 5.0 to 8.0
percent decreases in their per case payment level. The next largest negative impacts are among urban hospitals in
the West North Central and West South Central census divisions, each with a ^0.3 percent change. 




F. Impacts of MGCRB Reclassifications (Column 5) 




By March 30 of each year, the MGCRB makes reclassification determinations that will be effective for the next fiscal
year, which begins on October 1. The MGCRB may reclassify a hospital to an adjacent urban area or to a rural area with
which it has a close proximity for the purposes of using the other area's standardized amount, wage index value, or
both. (An RRC or an SCH may be redesignated to an area that is not an adjacent county.) 


To this point, all of the simulation models have assumed hospitals are paid on the basis of their geographic location
(with the exception of ongoing policies that provide that certain hospitals receive payments on bases other than
where they are geographically located, such as RRCs and hospitals in rural counties that are deemed urban under section
1886(d)(8)(B) of the Act). The changes in column 5 reflect the per case payment impact of moving from this baseline
to a simulation incorporating the MGCRB decisions for FY 1995. As noted above, these decisions affect hospitals'
standardized amount and wage index area assignments. In addition, hospitals reclassified for the standardized
amount also qualify to be treated as urban for purposes of the DSH adjustment. 


The proposed FY 1995 standardized payment amounts and wage index values incorporate all of the MGCRB's reclassification
decisions that will be effective for FY 1995. The wage index values also reflect any decisions made by the HCFA Administrator
through the appeals and review process for MGCRB decisions as of March 30, 1994. Additional changes that result from
the Administrator's review of MGCRB decisions will be incorporated into the wage index values and standardized payment
amounts published in the final rule implementing changes to the prospective payment system for FY 1995. 


The overall effect of geographic reclassification is required to be budget neutral by section 1886(d)(8)(D) of the
Act. Prior to FY 1995, the Secretary was required to adjust the urban standardized amounts so as to ensure that total
aggregate payments under the prospective payment system after geographic reclassification were equal to the aggregate
payments that would have been made absent these provisions. The rural standardized amounts were also adjusted to
ensure that aggregate payments to rural hospitals were not affected by reclassifications. Due to the elimination
of the separate rural amount beginning October 1, 1994, the Secretary is required to provide a single budget neutrality
adjustment to the standardized amounts for the effects of reclassification. We applied an adjustment of 0.993814
to ensure that the effects of reclassification are budget neutral. 


Rural hospitals benefit disproportionately from geographic reclassification. Their payments rise 2.3 percent,
while payments to urban hospitals decline 0.4 percent. Rural referral centers experience a 4.3 percent increase
overall as a result of reclassification. Of the 138 hospitals in this category, 52 are reclassified for the wage index.
This positive impact on RRCs also appears in the category of rural hospitals with 200 or more beds, which have a 4.7 increase
in payments.

Large urban hospitals lose 0.6 percent because, as a group, they have the smallest percentage of hospitals that are
reclassified, fewer than 6 percent. There are enough hospitals in other urban areas that are reclassified to limit
the decline in payments to this groups to 0.1 percent. Consequently, their payments are reduced by the budget neutrality
factor. Among urban hospital groups generally, payments fall between 0.3 and 0.5 percent. 


Among hospitals grouped by reclassification status during FY 1994 and FY 1995, the changes are predictable. Hospitals
reclassified for FY 1994 but not for FY 1995 experience lower payments when reclassification is taken into account
compared to the previous column. Because the rural payment rate now equals the other urban amount, the loss of reclassification
is not as detrimental in rural areas. Payments to formerly reclassified rural hospitals fall by 0.5 percent, compared
to a decline of 1.1 percent for urban hospitals reclassified in FY 1994 but not in FY 1995. Significant positive impacts
are evident for hospitals reclassified for FY 1995. Rural hospitals reclassified for FY 1995 that were not reclassified
for FY 1994 experience a 6.0 percent payment increase, and rural hospitals reclassified during both years experience
an 8.5 percent increase. 


Table II compares reclassified hospital payments for FY 1995 with payment levels that assume reclassified hospitals
are paid on the basis of their geographic location rather than reclassified location. The difference between Table
II and Column 5 in Table I is that the simulations in Table II incorporate all of the policy changes we are proposing for
FY 1995, as well as the statutory changes, before and after reclassification. Specifically, Column 5 in Table I does
not include the outlier change enacted by section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66. This change is reflected in
the simulations in Table II.

Table II shows the changes in payments per case for all FY 1995 reclassified and nonreclassified hospitals in urban
and rural locations for each of the three reclassification categories (standardized amount only, wage index only,
or both). It illustrates that the large impact for reclassified rural hospitals is due to reclassifications for both
the standardized amount and the wage index. These hospitals receive a 16.6 percent increase. In addition, rural hospitals
reclassified for the wage index only receive an 8.7 percent payment increase. The overall impact on reclassified
hospitals would be to increase their payments per case by an average of 4.2 percent for FY 1995. 
The reclassification of hospitals primarily affects payment to nonreclassified hospitals through changes in the
wage index and the geographic reclassification budget neutrality adjustment required by section 1886(d)(8)(D)
of the Act. Among hospitals that were not reclassified, the overall impact of hospital reclassifications would be
an average decrease in payments per case of about 0.6 percent, approximately the geographic reclassification budget
neutrality factor. Rural nonreclassified hospitals decrease slightly less, experiencing a 0.5 percent decrease.
This occurs because the wage index values in some rural areas increase after reclassified hospitals are excluded
from the calculation of those index values. 
The number of reclassifications for the standardized amount have not declined from FY 1994. This is surprising because,
with the elimination of the separate rural amount, rural hospitals would seem to have less to gain from reclassifying
for the standardized amount. Of course, some of them are hospitals reclassifying for the large urban amount, thereby
receiving a payment rate even higher than they would receive from the other national amount. Rural hospitals also
may wish to reclassify for the standardized amount even though they are only eligible to reclassify to an other urban
area in order to either meet the lower eligibility requirements for DSH payments, or to receive higher DSH payments.
The payment impact upon hospitals reclassified for the standardized amount only, however, is significantly lower
than it is for hospitals reclassifying for either the wage index alone, or for both the wage index and the standardized
amount. 
The foregoing analysis was based on MGCRB and HCFA Administrator decisions made by March 30 of this year. As previously
noted, there will be changes to some MGCRB decisions through the appeals and review process. The outcome of these cases
may affect the final results of our analysis, which we will present in the final rule. 


G. Outlier Changes (Column 6)

Medicare provides extra payment in addition to the regular DRG payment amount for extremely costly or extraordinarily
lengthy cases (cost outliers and day outliers, respectively). Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103-66 requires
the Secretary to phase out payment for day outliers in 25 percent increments beginning in FY 1995. This reduction in
day outlier payments will be offset by an increase in payments for cost outliers. The statute also requires the Secretary
to establish a fixed loss per case threshold for cost outliers instead of a threshold based on a fixed multiple of the
DRG payment amount or other fixed dollar amount. For FY 1995, we are proposing that a case would receive cost outlier
payment if costs exceed the DRG amount plus $23,300. We are also proposing to increase the marginal cost factor for
cost outliers from 75 to 80 percent. 
The payment impacts of this change are minimal. The largest impacts appear to be related to geographic location in
terms of census divisions. Urban hospitals in the Middle Atlantic census division have payment reductions of 0.5
percent per case. Rural Middle Atlantic hospitals have a 0.3 percent decline. In New England, both urban and rural
hospitals experience decreases of 0.2 percent. Since the changes to outlier policy result in a shift in payments from
cases paid as day outliers to cases paid as cost outliers, this indicates that these areas have higher percentages
of day outliers. This is consistent with our previous analysis indicating above average impacts related to day outlier
policy changes in the northeastern portion of the country (see the June 4, 1992 proposed rule, 57 FR 23824). 
The largest negative impact occurs among hospitals for which we could not determine Medicare utilization rates.
This group experiences a 1.4 percent fall in payments per case. This appears to be primarily attributable to 9 hospitals
whose outlier payment percentages fall by more than 20 percent. 


H. All Changes (Column 7) 


Column 7 compares our estimate of payments per case for FY 1995 to our estimate of payments per case in FY 1994. It includes
all of the changes discussed in the previous columns. It also includes the impacts of statutory differences from FY
1994 to FY 1995. These differences were noted in the introduction. Specifically, they are: an increase in DSH payments
to urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and to rural hospitals with 500 or more beds, and the elimination of the MDH provision.
This column also displays the impact of the 1.1 percent lower than estimated outlier payments during FY 1994, also
described in the introduction and the Addendum. 
Another change from FY 1994 is that there is no budget neutrality adjustment to account for midyear wage index corrections.
Last year's adjustment factor was 0.998188. In addition, a single geographic reclassification budget neutrality
factor was applied to the proposed FY 1995 standardized amounts of 0.993814. The FY 1994 factors applied to the urban
and rural amounts, respectively, were 0.992529 and 0.999472. Finally, the budget neutrality adjustment factor
for the updated wage index and the DRG recalibration is 0.997647, compared to the FY 1994 factor of 0.999003. Although
the net effect of these changes are small, they have an effect on the payment differences shown in this column. 
Column 7 also reflects the 1.1 percent updates to the urban standardized amounts. The increase in differential payments
to rural hospitals that results from eliminating the rural amount is shown in Column 1. There may also be interactive
effects among the various factors comprising the payment system that we are not able to isolate. For these reasons,
the values in column 7 may not equal the sum of the previous columns plus the other impacts that we are able to identify.
We also note that the percent changes associated with geographic reclassification decisions by the MGCRB shown in
Column 5 are not included in the percent changes shown here, since Column 5 reflects the impacts of geographic reclassifications
relative to the FY 1995 baseline rather than the FY 1994 reclassifications. The impacts of FY 1994 geographic reclassifications
relative to the payment impacts of FY 1995 reclassifications are shown in Column 5. 
The impact on all hospitals is a 3.0 percent increase in payments from FY 1994. The net change in total payments due to
the proposed changes for FY 1995 shown in columns 1 through 6 is 0.7 percent, due to the elimination of the rural standardized
amount. After accounting for the 1.1 percent update to the urban standardized amounts, the move to a single outlier
offset, and a smaller overall geographic reclassification budget neutrality factor, the difference between the
FY 1994 final standardized amounts and the FY 1995 proposed standardized amounts is 1.5 percent. As described in the
discussion of the impacts of eliminating the rural amount, the portion of this increase due to the smaller outlier
offset is already reflected in the changes shown in Column 1. In addition, the update to the hospital-specific rate
for SCHs is 1.4 percent in FY 1995. The average increase in payments due to updates that is shown in Column 7 and not in
Column 1 is about 1.2 percent.

Other significant changes that have not been isolated in the previous columns include the following:

 A 1.1 percent higher level of outlier payments is estimated for FY 1995.

 The increase in the DSH formula for FY 1995 results in approximately a 0.1 percent increase in total payments.

 The effect of eliminating the MDH provision is a 3.1 percent decline in payments for this group of hospitals,
and a 0.2 percent decline for rural hospitals. The impact on total payments is essentially zero.

As a geographic group, hospitals in rural areas experience the largest payment increase, a 3.8 percent rise in payments
per case over FY 1994. The increase in estimated outlier payments over FY 1994 for rural hospitals is 0.4 percent, below
the 1.1 percent difference for all hospitals. As we noted in the discussion of Column 5, eliminating the rural amount
would be expected to reduce the numbers and effects of geographic reclassification. While the number of FY 1995 reclassifications
does not appear to have fallen, however, the payment effects are less than they would have been without eliminating
the rural amount. One sees this effect in Column 7 when examing the rows containing rural hospitals reclassified during
both FY 1994 and FY 1995 and rural hospitals reclassified during FY 1994 only. The 295 hospitals in the former category
experience an overall increase of 2.7 percent, closer to that of urban hospitals, and the 149 hospitals in the latter
category experience a 3.6 percent decline in payments per case.

Hospitals in large and other urban areas experience 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent increases, respectively. Urban hospitals
are affected the most by the change in outlier payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995, a 1.2 percent increase. They also receive
the bulk of the increase in DSH payments, a 0.1 percent increase. Urban hospitals receive a net increase due to FY 1995
geographic reclassifications relative to FY 1994 reclassifications. Again, examining the rows grouping hospitals
by their reclassification status for FY 1994 and FY 1995, urban hospitals reclassified for both years have payment
increases above those of rural hospitals, and urban hospitals reclassified for FY 1994 but not FY 1995 do not lose as
much as rural hospitals.

Among urban bed size groups, Column 7 shows changes in payments ranging from 2.4 percent for the smallest hospitals
to 3.4 percent for the largest hospitals. The relatively smaller increases for the smaller urban hospitals appears
to be due to the negative impacts of the new wage data, as shown in Column 3. Larger urban hospitals appear to benefit
from the large increase due to geographic reclassifications in FY 1995 for 4 hospitals that were not reclassified
in FY 1994.

The reverse occurs for rural hospitals. Among the smallest rural hospitals (fewer than 50 beds), the effects of changes
in reclassification from FY 1994 to FY 1995 are negated by similar numbers of hospitals gaining and losing reclassification
from one year to the next. The payment changes for larger rural hospitals are smaller primarily because they do not
benefit to the same extent from the elimination of the rural standardized amount. They do, however, tend to benefit
from geographic reclassification in FY 1995 compared to FY 1994.

Table III presents the projected average payments per case under the changes for FY 1995 for urban and rural hospitals
and for the different categories of hospitals shown in Table I. It compares the projected payments for FY 1995 with
the average estimated per case payments for FY 1994. Thus, this table presents, in terms of the average dollar amounts
paid per discharge, the combined effects of the changes presented in Table I. That is, the percentage changes shown
in the last column of Table I equal the percentage changes in average payments from October 1, 1993 to October 1, 1994.



VII. Impact of Changes in the Capital Prospective Payment System 


A. General Considerations 


We now have data that were unavailable in previous impact analyses. Specifically, we have cost report data for the
first year of the capital prospective payment system (cost reports beginning in FY 1992) available through the December
1993 update of the Hospital Cost Report Information System (HCRIS). We also have information on the aggregate amount
of obligated capital approved by the fiscal intermediaries. However, our impact analysis of payment changes for
capital-related costs is still limited by the lack of hospital-specific data on several items. These are the hospital's
projected new capital costs for each year, its projected old capital costs for each year, and the actual amounts of
obligated capital that will be put in use for patient care and recognized as Medicare old capital costs in each year.
The lack of such information affects our impact analysis in the following ways: 
 Major investment in hospital capital assets (for example in building and major fixed equipment) occurs at
irregular intervals. As a result, there can be significant variation in the growth rates of Medicare capital-related
costs per case among hospitals. We do not have the necessary hospital-specific budget data to project the hospital
capital growth rate for an individual hospital.

 Moreover, our policy of recognizing certain obligated capital as old capital complicates the problem of projecting
future capital-related costs for individual hospitals. Under  412.302(c), a hospital was required to notify
its intermediary that it has obligated capital, no later than the later of October 1, 1992 or 90 days after the beginning
of the hospital's first cost reporting period under the capital prospective payment system. The intermediary must
then notify the hospital of its determination whether the criteria for recognition of obligated capital have been
met by the later of the end of the hospital's first cost reporting period subject to the capital prospective payment
system or 9 months after the receipt of the hospital's notification. The amount that is recognized as old capital is
limited to the lesser of the actual allowable costs when the asset is put in use for patient care or the estimated costs
of the capital expenditure at the time it was obligated. We have substantial information regarding intermediary
determinations of aggregate projected obligated capital amounts. However, we still do not know when these projects
will actually be put into use for patient care, the amount that will be recognized as obligated capital when the project
is put into use, or the Medicare share of the recognized costs. Therefore, we do not know actual obligated capital commitments
to be used in the FY 1995 capital cost projections. We discuss in Appendix B the assumptions and computations we employ
to generate the amount of obligated capital commitments for use in the FY 1995 capital cost projections. 
In Table IV of this appendix, we present the redistributive effects that are expected to occur between ``hold-harmless''
hospitals and ``fully prospective'' hospitals in FY 1995. In addition, we have integrated sufficient hospital-specific
information into our actuarial model to project the impact of FY 1995 capital payment policies by the standard prospective
payment system hospital groupings. We caution that while we now have actual information on the effects of the transition
payment methodology and interim payments under the capital prospective payment system and cost report data for most
hospitals, we need to generate randomly numbers for the change in old capital costs, new capital costs for each year,
and obligated amounts that will be put in use for patient care services and recognized as old capital each year. This
means that we continue to be unable to predict accurately an individual hospital's FY 1995 capital costs; however,
with the more recent data on the experience to date under the capital prospective payment system, there is adequate
information to estimate the aggregate impact on most hospital groupings. 
We present the transition payment methodology by hospital grouping in Table V. In Table VI we present the results of
the cross-sectional analysis using the results of our actuarial model. This table presents the aggregate impact
of the FY 1995 payment policies. In Table VII, we present a simulation of payments based on 100 percent of the Federal
rate. This simulation shows the average percentage change in the Federal rate attributable to the updated rate and
changes in payment adjustments.

B. Projected Impact Based on the Proposed FY 1995 Actuarial Model


1. Assumptions 


In this impact analysis, we model dynamically the impact of the capital prospective payment system from FY 1994 to
FY 1995 using a capital acquisition model. The FY 1995 model, described in Appendix B of this proposed rule, integrates
actual data from individual hospitals with randomly generated capital cost amounts. We have available capital cost
data from cost reports beginning in FY 1989, FY 1990, FY 1991 and FY 1992 received through the December 1993 update of
the Hospital Cost Reporting Information System (HCRIS), interim payment data for hospitals already receiving capital
prospective payments through PRICER, and data reported by the intermediaries that include the hospital-specific
rate determinations that have been made through January 1, 1994 in the Provider-Specific file. We used this data to
determine the proposed FY 1995 capital rates. However, we do not have individual hospital data on old capital changes,
new capital formation, and actual obligated capital costs. We have data on costs for capital in use in FY 1992, and we
age that capital by a formula described in Appendix B. We therefore need to generate randomly only new capital acquisitions
for any year after FY 1992. All Federal rate payment parameters are assigned to the applicable hospital. 
For purposes of this impact analysis, the FY 1995 actuarial model includes the following assumptions: 
 Medicare inpatient capital costs per discharge will increase at the following rates during these periods:






 

 

 The Medicare case-mix index will increase by 1.5 percent in FY 1994 and FY 1995, and 2.0 percent in FY 1996 and
later. 
 The Federal capital rate as well as the hospital-specific rate will be updated by the 2-year moving average
increase in Medicare capital costs per case, net of case-mix change increase, between FY 1990 and FY 1992. The proposed
FY 1995 update for inflation is 2.22 percent (see Addendum, Part III). 
 Consistent with the budget neutrality constraints provided in section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act, estimated
aggregate Medicare payments for capital costs in FY 1995 will equal 90 percent of the amount that would have been payable
on a reasonable cost basis. The budget neutrality adjustment factor will be applied to the Federal and hospital-specific
rates only and not to the hold-harmless state payment for old capital.

2. Results 



We have used the actuarial model to estimate the change in payment for capital-related costs from FY 1994 to FY 1995.
To show the effect of the capital prospective payment system on low capital cost hospitals and high capital cost hospitals,
we are presenting separately in Table IV the results of our simulation for these hospitals. We consider a hospital
to be a low capital cost hospital if, based on a comparison of its initial hospital-specific rate and the applicable
Federal rate, it will be paid under the fully prospective payment methodology. A high capital cost hospital is a hospital
that, based on its initial hospital-specific rate, will be paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology. Based
on our actuarial model, the breakdown of hospitals is as follows: 









A low capital cost hospital may request to have its hospital-specific rate redetermined based on old capital costs
in the current year, through the later of the hospital's cost reporting period beginning in FY 1994 or the first cost
reporting period beginning after obligated capital comes into use (within the limits established in  412.302(e)
for putting obligated capital in use for patient care). If the redetermined hospital-specific rate is greater than
the adjusted Federal rate, these hospitals will be paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology. Regardless
of whether the hospital became a hold-harmless payment hospital as a result of a redetermination, we have continued
to show these hospitals as low capital cost hospitals in Table IV. 

Assuming no behavioral changes in capital expenditures, Table IV displays the percentage change in payments from
FY 1994 to FY 1995 using the above described actuarial model.

Under section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act, aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment system for FY 1992
through 1995 respectively, are to equal 90 percent of what would have been payable on a reasonable cost basis in each
year. (See Addendum, Part III for a full discussion of the capital budget neutrality provision.) Currently, we project
that in FY 1994 aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment system will be 93.05 percent of reasonable
costs, or 3.05 percentage points higher than the 90 percent target. We also estimate an increase in capital cost per
case of 5.70 percent from FY 1994 to FY 1995. To achieve budget neutrality in FY 1995, we estimate there would be an aggregate
2.24 percent increase in FY 1995 Medicare capital payments over the FY 1994 payments. 

We project that low capital cost hospitals paid under the fully prospective payment methodology will experience
an average case-weighted increase in payments of 3.09 percent, and high capital cost hospitals will experience an
average increase of 1.42 percent. 

For hospitals paid under the fully prospective payment methodology, the Federal rate payment percentage will increase
from 30 percent to 40 percent and the hospital-specific rate payment percentage will decrease from 70 to 60 percent
in FY 1995. 

The Federal rate payment percentage for a hospital paid under the hold-harmless payment methodology is based on the
hospital's ratio of new capital costs to total capital costs. The average Federal rate payment percentage for those
hospitals receiving a hold-harmless payment for old capital will increase from 17.05 percent to 20.04 percent. We
estimate the percentage of hold-harmless hospitals paid based on 100 percent of the Federal rate will increase from
39 percent to 40 percent. 

The average hospital-specific rate payment per discharge falls from $151.74 in FY 1994 to $124.32 in FY 1995. A decline
in the average hospital-specific rate payment per discharge from FY 1994 to FY 1995 is to be expected because of the
reduction in the hospital-specific rate blend percentage and the 5.76 percent decrease in the hospital-specific
rate from FY 1994 to FY 1995. 

We are proposing no changes in our exceptions policies for FY 1995. As a result, the minimum payment levels would be:


 90 percent for sole community hospitals; 

 80 percent for urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and a disproportionate share patient percentage of 20.2
percent or more; or, 

 70 percent for all other hospitals. 

We estimate that exceptions payments will increase from 0.7 percent of payments in FY 1994 to 1.37 percent of payments
in FY 1995. The projected distribution of the payments is shown in the table below: 






C. Cross-Sectional Comparison of Capital Prospective Payment Methodologies 



Table V presents a cross-sectional summary of hospital groupings by capital prospective payment methodology. This
distribution is generated by our actuarial model.

As we explain in Appendix B, we were not able to determine a hospital-specific rate for 24 of the 5,248 hospitals in our
data base. Consequently, the payment methodology distribution is based on 5,224 hospitals. This data should be fully
representative of the payment methodologies that will be applicable to hospitals. 

The cross-sectional distribution of hospital by payment methodology is presented by: (1) geographic location,
(2) region, and (3) payment classification. This provides an indication of the percentage of hospitals within a particular
hospital grouping that will be paid under the fully prospective payment methodology and under the hold-harmless
methodology. 

Table V indicates that 58.3 percent of hospitals are paid under the fully prospective payment methodology. (This
figure, unlike the figure of 64 percent for low cost capital hospitals in the previous section, takes account of the
effects of redeterminations. In other words, this figure does not include low cost hospitals that, following a hospital-specific
rate redetermination, are now paid under the hold-harmless methodology.) As expected, a relatively higher percentage
of rural and governmental hospitals (69.9 percent and 73.3 percent, respectively) are being paid under the fully
prospective methodology. This is a reflection of their lower than average capital costs per case. In contrast, only
30 percent of proprietary hospitals are being paid under the fully prospective methodology. This is a reflection
of their higher than average capital costs per case. (We found at the time of the August 30, 1991 final rule (56 FR 43430)
that 62.7 percent of proprietary hospitals had a capital cost per case above the national average cost per case.) 



D. Cross-Sectional Analysis of Changes in Aggregate Payments 



We used our FY 1995 actuarial model to estimate the potential impact of our proposed changes for FY 1995 on total capital
payments per case, using a universe of 5,224 hospitals. The individual hospital payment parameters are taken from
the best available data, including: the January 1, 1994 update to the Provider-Specific file, cost report data, and
audit information supplied by intermediaries. Table VI presents a comparison of payments per case for FY 1994 and
FY 1995. It also presents the portion of total percentage change in payments that can be attributed to Federal rate
changes alone. Federal rate changes include the 6.47 percent decrease in the Federal rate, a 1.5 percent increase
in case mix, changes in the adjustments to the Federal rate (for example, the effect of the new hospital wage index on
the geographic adjustment factor), and reclassifications by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board.
The residual increase over the change attributable to the Federal rate changes can be attributed to the effects of
transition changes, which include: the change from 30 percent to 40 percent in the portion of the Federal rate for fully
prospective hospitals, the hospital-specific rate update, changes in the proportion of new to total capital for
hold-harmless hospitals, changes in old capital (for example, obligated capital put in use), hospital-specific
rate redeterminations, and exceptions. The comparisons are provided by: (1) geographic location and (2) payment
classification and payment region. 

The simulation results show that, on average, payments per case can be expected to increase 2.2 percent in FY 1995.
The results show that the effect of the Federal rate changes alone is to decrease payments by 1.3 percent. However,
the decrease attributable to the Federal rate changes is more than offset by a 3.5 percent increase attributable to
the effects of transition changes and budget neutrality. 

Our comparison by geographic location shows that urban and rural hospitals experience similar rates of increase
(2.2 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively). Urban hospitals will lose slightly less than rural hospitals (^1.3
percent compared to ^1.6 percent) from the Federal rate changes. Urban hospitals will also gain slightly less than
rural hospitals (3.5 percent compared to 3.9 percent) from the effects of transition changes. 

By region, rural hospitals of the New England region have the highest rate of increase (12.3 percent, of which ^1.9
percent is due to Federal rate changes and 14.2 percent to the effects of transition changes). Puerto Rico hospitals
fare worst: these hospitals will experience a 2.5 percent decline in payments, of which ^3.4 percent is attributable
to Federal rate changes and 0.9 percent to the effects of transition changes. 

By type of ownership, government hospitals are projected to have the highest rate of increase (3.3 percent, of which
^1.5 percent is due to Federal rate changes and 4.8 percent to the effects of transition changes). Payments to proprietary
hospitals will decrease 0.2 percent (^1.2 percent due to the Federal rate changes and 1.0 percent attributable to
the effects of transition changes) and payments to voluntary hospitals will increase 2.5 percent (^1.3 percent due
to Federal rate changes and 3.8 percent to the effects of transition changes). 

Section 1886(d)(10) of the Act established the Medicare Geographic Review Board (MGCRB). Hospitals may apply for
reclassification for the purpose of the wage index, standardized payment amount, or both. Although there is no difference
with respect to the Federal capital rate, a hospital's geographic classification for purposes of the operating standardized
amount does affect a hospital's capital payments as a result of the large urban adjustment factor and the disproportionate
share adjustment for urban hospitals with 100 or more beds. Reclassification for wage index purposes affects the
geographic adjustment factor since that factor is constructed from the hospital wage index. 

To present the effects of the hospitals being reclassified for FY 1995 compared to the FY 1994 effects of reclassification,
we show the average payment percentage increase for hospitals reclassified in each fiscal year and in total. For FY
1995 reclassifications, we are indicating those hospitals reclassified for standardized amount purposes only,
for wage index purposes only, and for both purposes. The reclassified groups are compared to all other nonreclassified
hospitals. These categories are further identified by urban and rural designation. 

Hospitals reclassified during FY 1995 as a whole are projected to experience a 2.3 percent increase in payments (^1.0
attributable to Federal rate changes and 3.3 percent attributable to the effects of transition changes). Nonreclassified
hospitals will gain slightly less (2.2 percent) than reclassified hospitals (2.3 percent) overall. While nonreclassified
hospitals will lose slightly more (^1.4 percent compared to ^1.0 percent) than reclassified hospitals from the Federal
rate changes, they will gain more (3.6 percent to 3.3 percent) from the effects of transition changes.

E. Cross-Sectional Analysis of Changes in the Federal Rate



The analysis in Table VII examines the impact of the following changes in the Federal rate set forth in section III of
the addendum to this proposed rule_

 The effects of eliminating the separate operating prospective payment system rural standardized amount,
as required under section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act (column 3). 

 The effects of the annual reclassification of DRGs and recalibration of the DRG weights required by section
1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act (column 4). 

 The effects of the annual update of wage survey data on the capital geographic adjustment factor (column 5).


 The effects of the proposed changes in transfer policy (column 6). 

 The effects of FY 1995 reclassifications by the MGCRB (column 7). 

 The effects of changes in outlier policy (column 8). 

 The effects of all proposed FY 1995 changes affecting the Federal rate, including those displayed in columns
3 through 8, compared to FY 1994 payments based on the Federal rate (column 9). 

To estimate the effects of these changes, we simulated payments based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. As a result,
the simulation in Table VII has two significant limitations. The simulation necessarily employs the FY 1994 and the
proposed FY 1995 Federal rates. However, the FY 1994 and FY 1995 Federal rates were determined on the basis of the transition
rules in which hospitals are paid various portions of the Federal rate. (Fully prospective hospitals receive 30 percent
of the Federal rate in FY 1994 and 40 percent in FY 1995. Hold-harmless hospitals receive a portion of the Federal rate
based on the hospital-specific ratio of new Medicare capitals costs to total Medicare capital costs. Approximately
16.7 percent of hospitals will be paid 100 percent of the Federal rate in FY 1995.) In particular, the budget neutrality
adjustment required to assure that aggregate payments equal 90 percent of reasonable costs would require revision
if all hospitals were paid 100 percent of the Federal rate. Thus, the simulation of 100 percent Federal rate payments
is based on rates that would be different if payments were actually based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. 

Furthermore, the simulation does not necessarily reflect accurately changes in capital prospective payment system
payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. Rather, it reflects the percentage change in payments that hospitals would experience
if all hospitals were paid 100 percent of the Federal rate. In fact, as previously noted, hospitals will receive varying
portions of their amounts on the basis of the Federal rate in FY 1995. Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that estimated
aggregate payments based on the Federal rate for any year after any changes from DRG reclassification and recalibration
and the geographic adjustment factor equal the estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would
have been made without such changes. Appendix B explains that the varying portions of the Federal rate paid to each
hospital are taken into account in determining the aggregate Federal rate payment amounts used to compute the DRG/GAF
budget neutrality adjustment. The aggregate Federal rate payments used to determine the budget neutrality adjustment
would be different if all hospitals were paid based on 100 percent of the Federal rate. Thus, Table VII represents the
change in payments under circumstances unlike those for which the DRG/GAF budget neutrality adjustment is computed.
As a result, it is to be expected that the full effects of that budget neutrality requirement will not be precisely reflected
in Table VII. 

The simulation in Table VII is not representative of changes in capital prospective payment system payments from
FY 1994 to FY 1995. Rather, it reflects the percentage change in payments for hospitals receiving 100 percent of the
Federal rate. For other hospitals, it reflects the percentage change in the Federal rate portion of payments, holding
the Federal rate portion constant. (Of course, for those other hospitals, the Federal rate portion changes in almost
all cases from FY 1994 to FY 1995.) Unlike the Federal rate payment change in Table VI, the analysis in Table VII also
does not include any increase in Federal rate payments attributable to anticipated increases in the case-mix index.


Because of the limitations on the simulation presented in Table VII, we are considering whether to omit this table
in future impact statements. We welcome comments on the utility of this table and its continued use in future impact
statements. 

The table shows that Federal rate payments can be expected to decrease 4.5 percent overall prior to consideration
of any increase in the case-mix index. This decrease is due to the 6.5 percent decrease in the Federal rate, which is
partially offset by the 1.9 percent increase in outlier payments. 

The table also shows the distributional effects of the changes in Federal rate payments from the changes noted above.
We modeled the effects of the changes in all columns, except column 7, in the same manner as in Table I above. Thus, column
3 displays the payment changes resulting from eliminating the rural standardized amount, modeled by comparing simulated
100 percent Federal rate payments using our FY 1995 baseline model (as described in the operating portion of this impact
analysis) to simulated payments after eliminating the separate rural amount. The changes in Federal rate payments
from eliminating the rural standardized amount are, as is to be expected, insignificant. The 0.1 percent gain for
other urban hospitals reflects the spillover effect of an increase in outlier payments for urban hospitals.

Column 4 presents the change in Federal rate payments of the combined effects of the revised DRG classification system,
and the subsequent recalibration of DRG weights incorporating these revised DRGs, as discussed in section II of this
proposed rule. The DRG changes are expected to produce only minimal effects on the distribution of Federal rate payments.
The highest gain from DRG reclassification and recalibration is projected at 0.1 percent (for several classes of
hospitals), while the largest loss is projected at ^0.3 percent (for urban disproportionate share hospitals with
100 beds or less). 

As with the previous two columns, the impact of the new wage data in Federal rate payments is isolated in column 5 by holding
the other payment parameters constant in the two comparison simulations. That is, the percentage changes demonstrate
the changes in Federal rate payments from our FY 1995 baseline_using the FY 1994 wage index before geographic reclassifications
based on 1990 wage survey data, after elimination of the separate rural rate and incorporating the FY 1995 GROUPER_to
a model substituting the FY 1995 pre-reclassification wage index based on data submitted for hospital cost reporting
periods beginning in FY 1991. The only significant changes from the use of new wage data on the capital geographic adjustment
factor are on hospitals in Puerto Rico. Urban Puerto Rico hospitals experience a decrease of 7.4 percent and rural
Puerto Rico hospitals experience a decrease of 10.7 percent. As is the case with similar decreases in operating prospective
payment system payments, these effects are attributable to improved reporting by hospitals.

]Column 6 illustrates the effects of the proposed transfer policy changes relative to a baseline simulation based
on current transfer policy. The effects of the changes in transfer policy are similar to those in operating prospective
payment system payments. The transfer changes increase Federal rate payments to rural hospitals by 0.5 percent,
and decrease Federal rate payments to urban hospitals by 0.1 percent. As is the case with operating prospective payments,
this result is due to the fact that rural hospitals benefit from changing the per diem methodology.

Column 7 displays the impact of the FY 1995 decisions by the MGCRB compared to FY 1994 reclassification decisions.
It includes all of the changes proposed for FY 1995 discussed up to this point. Therefore, in examining the changes
for particular hospital groups, the impacts discussed previously appear here as well (for example, the large decreases
in Puerto Rico due to the new wage data). This comparison corresponds with the methodology used to determine the GAF/DRG
budget neutrality adjustment factor. To accomplish this comparison, we have replaced the FY 1995 proposed capital
Federal rate with the FY 1994 Federal rate adjusted by the 1.00115 proposed GAF/DRG budget neutrality factor.

Column 8 shows the incremental effects of outlier changes alone. The changes shown in this column closely reflect
the changes in operating prospective payments shown in Table 1.

Column 9 displays the combined changes from the previous columns, as well as the effects of other factors affecting
Federal rate payments, compared to FY 1994 Federal rate payments. The other factors include: the change in the standard
Federal rate from FY 1994, the effect of geographic reclassifications on large urban status, and a 1.9 percent increase
in outlier payments. As noted in the previous discussion, the effects of changes in geographic reclassification
decisions from FY 1994 to FY 1995, in addition to the changes discussed in columns 3 through 6, are shown in column 7.
These effects are included in column 9 as well, along with the changes in outlier policy and the changes in the Federal
rate and outlier payments. Thus, only the last column reflects the effects of all quantifiable policy changes on simulated
FY 1995 Federal rate payments.

Appendix B: Technical Appendix on the Capital Acquisition Model and Budget Neutrality Adjustment 



Section 1886(g)(1)(A) of the Act requires that for FY 1992 through FY 1995 aggregate prospective payments for operating
costs under section 1886(d) of the Act and prospective payments for capital costs under section 1886(g) of the Act
be reduced each year in a manner that results in a 10 percent reduction of the amount that would have been payable on a
reasonable cost basis for capital-related costs in that year. Under  412.352, the 10 percent reduction is generated
entirely from the capital prospective payments. A budget neutrality adjustment factor is applied to the Federal
rate and hospital-specific rate so that total capital payments for each year from FY 1992 through FY 1995 equal 90 percent
of Medicare inpatient capital costs in each year. 

To calculate the budget neutrality adjustment, we must project the rate at which old capital will be depreciated and
written off and at which new capital will be acquired and depreciated. (Old capital costs include depreciation, lease,
interest expenses, and other capital-related costs defined in  412.302 for depreciable assets that are in
use for patient care or obligated on or before December 31, 1990.) 

In developing the FY 1992 prospective payment rates, there were limited capital data available that could be used
to project payments under the capital prospective payment system and develop the budget neutrality adjustment factor.
Consequently, we developed a capital acquisition model that relied on Monte Carlo random simulation techniques
to project capital costs for 6000 hypothetical hospitals. This model is described in detail in the August 30, 1991
final rule (56 FR 43517-43522). 

We now have cost report data for the first year of the capital prospective payment system. These cost reports begin
in FY 1992 (PPS-9) and provide a break-out of old and new capital for the first time. We used the December 1993 update
of the PPS-9 cost reports, the January 1, 1994 update of the provider specific file, and the December 1993 update
of the intermediary audit file as data sources. 

The available data still lack certain items that are required for the determination of budget neutrality, including
a hospital's projected new capital costs for each year, its projected old capital costs for each year, and the projected
obligated capital amounts that will be put in use for patient care services and recognized as old capital each year.


For FY 1993 and FY 1994, we implemented an integrated model that starts with the available data for existing hospitals
and back-fills the missing items with results from the capital acquisition model that was used to develop the FY 1992
payment rates. Since we now have data for FY 1992, we no longer need to use the integrated model, and, consequently,
we are no longer using the model that developed the FY 1992 rates. 

Since hospitals under alternative payment system waivers (that is, hospitals in Maryland and hospitals in the Finger
Lakes Area Hospital Corporation in New York) are currently excluded from the capital prospective payment system,
we excluded these hospitals from our model. 

We first developed FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 hospital-specific rates using the provider-specific file, the intermediary
audit file, and when available, cost reports. (We used the cumulative provider-specific file, which includes all
updates to each hospital's records, and chose the latest record for each fiscal year.) We checked the consistency
between the provider-specific file and the intermediary audit file. We also ensured that the FY 1993 increase in the
hospital-specific rate was at least 
0.62 percent (the net FY 1993 update) and that the FY 1994 hospital-specific rate was at least as large as the FY 1993
hospital-specific rate decreased by 2.16 percent (the net FY 1994 update). We were able to match hospitals to the files
as shown in the following table. 






Forty-five of these hospitals had unusable or missing data. We were able to back-fill a hospital-specific rate for
21 of these hospitals from the cost reports as shown in the following table. 






We did not have data for 24 hospitals, and had to drop them from the capital analysis. Most of these dropped hospitals
are new hospitals or hospitals with very few Medicare admissions. This leaves us with 5224 hospitals and should not
affect the precision of the budget neutrality determination.

We then determined old and new capital amounts for 
FY 1992 using the PPS-9 cost reports as the first source of data. Since we matched only 4,653 PPS-9 cost reports,
we also used the provider-specific file for old capital information. Even in cases where a cost report was available,
the break out of old and new capital was not always available. In these cases, we used the old capital amounts and new
capital ratios from the provider-specific file. If these were missing we derived the old capital amount from the hospital
specific rate. 

Finally, we used the intermediary audit file to develop obligated capital amounts. Some hospitals had indicated
that they could not bring the obligated capital on line before the expiration of this provision, so we excluded the
obligated amounts for these hospitals from the budget neutrality determination. Since the obligated amounts are
aggregate projected amounts, we computed a Medicare capital cost per admission associated with these amounts. We
adjusted the aggregate amounts by the following factors: 

(1) Medicare inpatient share of capital. This was derived from cost reports and was limited to the Medicare share of
total inpatient days. It was necessary to limit the Medicare share because of data integrity problems. Medicare share
of inpatient days is a reasonably good proxy for allocating capital. However, it may be understated if Medicare utilization
is high, and may be overstated because it ignores the outpatient share of capital. 

(2) Capitalization factor. This factor allocates the aggregate amount of obligated capital to depreciation and
interest amounts. Consistent with the assumptions in the capital input price index, we used a 25-year life for fixed
capital and a 10-year life for movable capital, and an average projected interest rate of 6.7 percent. We also assumed
that fixed capital acquisitions are about one-half of total capital. In conjunction with the useful life and interest
rate assumptions, the resulting capitalized fixed capital is about one-half of total capitalization. This is consistent
with the allocations between fixed and movable capital found on the cost reports. The ratio we developed is 0.137,
which produces the first year capitalization based on the aggregate amount. 

(3) A divisor of Medicare admissions to derive the capital per discharge amount. Since we must project capital amounts
for each hospital, we continued to use a Monte Carlo simulation to develop these amounts. The Monte Carlo simulation
is now used only to project capital costs per discharge amounts for each hospital. We analyzed the distributions of
capital increases, and noted a slightly negative correlation between the dollar level of capital per admission,
and the rate of increase in capital. To determine the rate of increase in capital cost per admission, we multiplied
the lesser of $3,000 or the capital cost per admission by .00006 and subtracted this result from 1.2. (Increases for
capital levels over $3,000 were not influenced by the level of capital, so this part of the calculation was capped at
$3,000.) We selected a random number from the normal distribution, multiplied it by 0.17 (the standard deviation)
and added it to ^0.04 (the mean) and then added 1 to create a multiplier. This random result was multiplied by the previous
result to assign a rate of increase factor which was multiplied by the prior year's capital per discharge amount to
develop a capital per discharge amount for the projected year. 

To model a projected year, we used the old and new capital for the prior year multiplied by 0.96 (aging factor). The 0.96
aging factor is the average of changes in capital over its life. The aged new and old capital is subtracted from the projected
capital described in the previous paragraph. The difference represents newly acquired capital. We assume that the
hospital would accrue only a half year of costs for newly acquired capital in the year in which the capital comes on line.
This is because, on average, new capital will come on line in the middle of the year. We make the same assumption for obligated
capital. If the hospital has obligated capital, the lesser of one half of the adjusted costs (as described in the succeeding
paragraph) for newly acquired capital or one half of the costs for obligated capital are deemed to apply to the current
year. The full year's costs for new or obligated capital are assumed to apply for the following year. For FY 1994, one
half of the costs for any outstanding obligated capital were deemed to apply to FY 1994; a full year's costs were deemed
to apply to FY 1995. With the exception of certain hospitals about whom we have information to the contrary, we assume
that hospitals would meet the expiration dates provided under the obligated capital provision. The on-line obligated
amounts are added to old capital and subtracted from the newly acquired capital to yield residual newly acquired capital,
which is then added to new capital. The residual newly acquired capital is never permitted to be less than zero. 

Next, we computed the average total capital cost per discharge from the capital costs that were generated by the model
and compared the results to total capital costs per discharge that we had projected independently of the model. We
adjusted the newly acquired capital amounts proportionately, so that the total capital costs per discharge generated
by the model match the independently projected capital costs per discharge. 

Once each hospital's capital-related costs are generated, the model projects capital payments. We use the actual
payment parameters (for example, the case-mix index and the geographic adjustment factor), that are applicable
to the specific hospital. 

To project capital payments, the model first assigns the applicable payment methodology (fully prospective or hold-harmless)
to the hospital. If available, the model uses the payment methodology indicated in the PPS-9 cost reports or
the provider-specific file. Otherwise, the model determines the methodology by comparing the hospital's FY 1992
hospital-specific rate to the adjusted Federal rate applicable to the hospital. The model simulates Federal rate
payments using the assigned payment parameters and hospital-specific estimated outlier payments. The case-mix
index for a hospital is derived from the 1993 MedPAR file using the proposed FY 1995 DRG relative weights published
in this rule. The case-mix index is increased each year after FY 1993 consistent with the continuing trend in case-mix
increase.

We analyzed the case-mix increases for the recent past and found that case-mix increases have decelerated to about
1.55 percent in FY 1992 and 0.83 percent in FY 1993. It is too early to reliably determine a case-mix increase for FY 1994
from the discharge data. Since case-mix increases appear to be decelerating, we have reduced our projected long-term
increase of 2 percent to 1.5 percent for both FY 1994 and FY 1995. We will continue to monitor case-mix increases and
make appropriate adjustments to our projections. (Since we are using FY 1993 cases for our analysis, the FY 1993 increase
in case mix has no effect on the FY 1995 Federal rate. It does affect the estimated update for the FY 1996 Federal rate
displayed in the projection table in this appendix.) 

Changes in geographic classification and corrections in the hospital wage data used to establish the hospital wage
index affect the geographic adjustment factor. Changes in the DRG classification system and the relative weights
affect the case-mix index. 

Section 13501(a)(3) of Public Law 103-66 requires that, for discharges occurring after September 30, 1993,
the unadjusted standard Federal rate be reduced by 7.4 percent. Consequently, the model reduces the unadjusted standard
Federal rate by 7.4 percent effective in FY 1994. Because of the budget neutrality provisions in effect through FY
1995, this provision does not reduce aggregate payments for capital in FY 1994 and FY 1995. 

Section 412.308(c)(4)(ii) requires that the estimated aggregate payments for the fiscal year, based on the Federal
rate after any changes resulting from DRG reclassifications and recalibration and the geographic adjustment factor,
equal the estimated aggregate payments based on the Federal rate that would have been made without such changes. For
FY 1994, the budget neutrality adjustment factor was 1.0033. To determine the factor for FY 1995, we first determined
the portion of the Federal rate that would be paid for each hospital in FY 1995 based on its applicable payment methodology.
We then compared estimated aggregate Federal rate payments based on the FY 1994 DRG relative weights and FY 1994 geographic
adjustment factor to estimated aggregate Federal rate payments based on the FY 1995 relative weights and the FY 1995
geographic adjustment factor. In making the comparison, we held the FY 1995 Federal rate portion constant and set
the other budget neutrality adjustment factor and exceptions reduction factor to 1.00. We determined that to achieve
budget neutrality for the changes in the geographic adjustment factor and DRG classifications and relative weights,
an incremental budget neutrality adjustment of 1.00115 for FY 1995 should be applied to the previous cumulative FY
1994 adjustment of 1.0033 (the product of the FY 1993 incremental adjustment of .9980 and the FY 1994 incremental adjustment
of 1.0053), yielding a cumulative adjustment of 1.00445 through FY 1995. 

The methodology used to determine the recalibration and geographic (DRG/GAF) budget neutrality adjustment factor
is similar to that used in establishing budget neutrality adjustments under the prospective payment system for operating
costs. One difference is that under the operating prospective payment system, the budget neutrality adjustments
for the effect of geographic reclassifications are determined separately from the effects of other changes in the
hospital wage index and the DRG weights. Under the capital prospective payment system, there is a single DRG/GAF budget
neutrality adjustment factor for changes in the geographic adjustment factor (including geographic reclassification)
and the DRG relative weights. In addition, there is no adjustment for the effects that geographic reclassification
has on the other payment parameters, such as the payments for serving low income patients or the large urban add-on.


In addition to computing the DRG/GAF budget neutrality adjustment factor, we used the model to project total aggregate
payments under the prospective payment system and to compute the budget neutrality adjustment factor that would
result in estimated payments under the capital prospective payment system equal to 90 percent of the amount that would
have been payable on a reasonable cost basis. This budget neutrality factor is applied to the Federal and hospital-specific
rates, but not to the hold-harmless payments. 

Additional payments under the exceptions process are accounted for through a reduction in the Federal and hospital-specific
rates. Therefore, we used the model to calculate estimated exceptions payments and the exceptions reduction factor.
This exceptions reduction factor ensures that estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment
system, including exceptions payments, equal estimated aggregate payments under the capital prospective payment
system without an exceptions process. Since changes in the level of the payment rates change the level of payments
under the exceptions process, the budget neutrality and exceptions adjustments factors must be determined through
iteration. Further, these two factors interact with each other so that they must be determined simultaneously. We
successfully determined values for these factors so that the exceptions adjustment factor is correct, and estimated
payments under the capital prospective payment system equal 90 percent of estimated Medicare inpatient capital
costs. 

In the August 30, 1991 final rule (56 FR 43517), we indicated that we would publish each year the estimated payment factors
generated by the model to determine payments for the next 5 years. The table below provides the actual factors for FY
1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994, the proposed factors for FY 1995, and the estimated factors that would be applicable through
FY 1999. We caution that, except with respect to FY 1992, FY 1993, FY 1994, and the proposed FY 1995, these are estimates
only, and are subject to revisions resulting from continued methodological refinements, more recent data, and any
payment policy changes that may occur. In this regard, we note that in making these projections we have assumed that
the cumulative DRG/GAF adjustment factor will remain at 1.00445 for FY 1995 and later because we do not have sufficient
information to estimate the change that will occur in the factor for years after FY 1995. 

The projections are as follows:

Appendix C



May 10, 1994.


The Honorable Albert Gore, Jr.,


President of the Senate, Washington, DC 20510



Dear Mr. President: 
Section 1886(e)(3)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services
report to Congress the initial estimate of the applicable percentage increase for FY 1995 that she will recommend
for hospitals subject to the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) and for hospitals and units excluded from
PPS. This submission constitutes the required report. 

Our recommendations are consistent with the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993.
For FY 1995, we recommend an average update for all hospitals subject to PPS equal to the percentage increase in the
hospital market basket (an index of inflation in goods and services used by hospitals) minus 1.4 percentage points.
We currently estimate that the market basket rate of increase for FY 1995 will be 3.6 percent. The average update for
all PPS hospitals would equal 2.2 percent (the market basket percentage increase of 3.6 percent minus 1.4 percent).


We are recommending the updates for urban and rural hospitals that are provided under current law. Under our recommendation
and OBRA 1993, urban PPS hospitals would receive the market basket rate of increase minus 2.5 percentage points, or
a 1.1 percent increase. Rural PPS hospitals would receive the market basket rate of increase plus 4.8 percentage points,
or 
8.4 percent. We currently have separate PPS payment rates for large urban, other urban and rural hospitals. However,
the law requires us to eliminate the separate rural rate and to establish a single rate for rural and other urban hospitals
beginning in FY 1995. The higher update for rural PPS hospitals eliminates the difference between the rate paid to
other urban and rural PPS hospitals. 

Sole community hospitals (SCHs) are the sole source of care in their area and are afforded special payment protection
to maintain access to services for Medicare beneficiaries. SCHs are paid the higher of a hospital-specific rate or
the Federal rate. Under our recommendation and OBRA 1993, the update to hospital-specific rates will equal the market
basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points or 1.4 percent. 

Hospitals and units that are excluded from PPS are paid based on reasonable costs subject to a limit under the Tax Equity
and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982. Consistent with current law, we recommend an increase in the TEFRA
limit equal to the rate of increase in the excluded hospital market basket (3.7 percent) minus 1.0 percentage points,
or 2.7 percent. 

Our recommendation for the updates is based on current projections of relevant data, and is consistent with the President's
budget. A final recommendation on the appropriate percentage increases for FY 1995 will be made nearer the beginning
of the new Federal Fiscal Year based on the most current market basket projection available at that time. The final
recommendation will incorporate our analysis of the latest estimates of all relevant factors, including recommendations
by the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC). 

Section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iv) of the Act requires that the Secretary include in her report recommendations with respect
to adjustments to the diagnosis-related group (DRG) weighting factors. At this time, we do not anticipate recommending
any adjustment to the DRG weighting factors for FY 1995. 

I am pleased to provide my recommendations to you. 


   Sincerely, 


<SIGNER>

Appendix D: Recommendation of Update Factors for Operating Cost Rates of Payment for Inpatient Hospital Services


I. Background 



Several provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) address the setting of update factors for services furnished
in FY 1995 by hospitals subject to the prospective payment system and those excluded from the prospective payment
system. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act sets the FY 1995 percentage increases in the operating cost standardized
amounts equal to the rate of increase in the hospital market basket minus 2.5 percentage points for prospective payment
hospitals located in urban areas. For hospitals located in rural areas, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) requires the
Secretary to apply an update so as to make the rural national average standardized amounts equal to the other urban
national average standardized amount. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) sets the FY 1995 percentage increase to the hospital-specific
rate applicable to sole community hospitals equal to the rate of increase in the hospital market basket minus 2.2 percentage
points. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act sets the FY 1995 percentage increase in the rate-of-increase limits
for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system equal to the rate of increase in the excluded hospital
market basket minus a reduction factor (not to exceed 1.0 percent) depending on the provider's operating costs and
target amounts. 

In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act, we are proposing to update the average standardized amounts,
the hospital-specific rates and the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment
system as provided in section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. Based on the currently forecasted market basket increase
of 3.6 percent for hospitals subject to the prospective payment system, the proposed updates in the standardized
amounts are 1.1 percent for hospitals in urban areas and approximately 8.4 percent for hospitals in rural areas. The
proposed update in the hospital-specific rate applicable to sole community hospitals is 1.4 percent (that is, the
market basket rate of increase of 3.6 percent minus 2.2 percentage points). The proposed update for hospitals excluded
from the prospective payment system is based on the percentage increase in the excluded hospital market basket (currently
estimated at 3.7 percent) minus a reduction factor (not to exceed 1.0 percent). 

Sections 1886(e)(2)(A) and (3)(A) of the Act require that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC)
recommend to the Congress by March 1, 1994 an update factor that takes into account changes in the market basket rate
of increase index, hospital productivity, technological and scientific advances, the quality of health care provided
in hospitals, and long-term cost effectiveness in the provision of inpatient hospital services. 

In its March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC recommended update factors to the standardized amounts equal to the percentage
increase in the market basket minus 1.5 percentage points for urban hospitals and the market basket rate of increase
plus 1.6 percentage points for hospitals located in rural areas. Based on its market basket rate of increase estimate
of 3.7 percent, ProPAC's recommended updates to the standardized amounts equal 2.2 percent for hospitals located
in urban areas and 5.3 percent for hospitals located in rural areas. ProPAC recommended that the update for the hospital-specific
rates applicable to sole community hospitals be equal to the average update for all hospitals (that is, equal to the
percentage increase in the market basket minus 1.0 percentage point, or 2.7 percent based on a market basket rate of
increase estimate of 3.7 percent). The components of ProPAC's update factor recommendations are described in detail
in the ProPAC report, which is published as Appendix F to this document. We discuss ProPAC's recommendations concerning
the update factors and our responses to those recommendations below. 

Section 1886(e)(4) of the Act requires that the Secretary, taking into consideration the recommendations of ProPAC,
recommend update factors for FY 1995 that take into account the amounts necessary for the efficient and effective
delivery of medically appropriate and necessary care of high quality. Under section 1886(e)(5) of the Act, we are
required to publish the recommended FY 1995 update factors that are provided for under section 1886(e)(4) of the Act.
Accordingly, this appendix provides our recommendations of appropriate update factors, our analysis of the derivation
of the amount of the update factors, and our responses to the ProPAC recommendations concerning the update factors.




II. Secretary's Recommendations 



Under section 1886(e)(4) of the Act, we are recommending that the standardized amounts be increased by an average
amount equal to the market basket rate of increase minus 2.5 percentage points for hospitals located in urban areas
and the market basket rate of increase plus 4.8 percentage points for hospitals located in rural areas (before the
effects of adjustments for outlier, geographic reclassification and recalibration of the DRG relative weights).
Our recommendation for a higher update to the rural standardized amount is intended to eliminate the differential
between the standardized amounts for other urban and rural hospitals, as required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X)
of the Act. We are also recommending an update of the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points to the
hospital-specific rate for sole community hospitals. These figures are consistent with the President's budget
recommendation, given the new market basket forecast of 3.6 percent. 

We recommend that hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system receive an update equal to the percentage
increase in the market basket that measures input price increases for services furnished by excluded hospitals minus
1.0 percentage point. That market basket rate of increase is currently forecast at 3.7 percent. Subtracting 1.0 percentage
point would result in an update for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system of 2.7 percent. 

As required by section 1886(e)(4) of the Act, we have taken into consideration the recommendations of ProPAC in setting
these recommended update factors. Our responses to the ProPAC recommendations concerning the update factors are
discussed below. 



III. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Prospective Payment System Standardized Amounts 



For FY 1995, ProPAC recommends that the standardized amount be updated by the following factors: 

 The projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket (which was estimated to be 3.7 percent in ProPAC's
March 1, 1994 report) with an adjustment of 0.0 percentage points to account for the different wage and salary price
proxies used for the ProPAC market basket rate of increase. 

 A correction of ^1.1 percent to reflect the forecast error in the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase.

 A discretionary adjustment factor of ^0.4 percent 
composed of an allowance of 0.3 percent for scientific and 
technological advancement and an allowance of ^0.7 percent 
for productivity improvement. 
 An adjustment for case-mix change of 0.0 percent. 
 A differential update of 3.1 percent for hospitals 
located in rural areas to reflect the phasing out of the 
differential in the standardized amounts between rural and 
other urban hospitals. 
Overall, the net increase employing the above factors 
is the percentage increase in the hospital market basket 
minus 1.5 percentage points for urban hospitals and the 
market basket percentage increase plus 1.6 percentage points 
for rural hospitals. Based on the market basket rate of 
increase estimate of 3.7 percent used in its March 1, 1994 
report, ProPAC recommends that urban hospitals receive a 
2.2 percent update and rural hospitals receive a 5.3 percent 
update. 
Response: We are recommending an update that is 
consistent with the Administration's budget proposal and the 
requirements of section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as 
amended by section 13501(a) of Public Law 103-66. Our 
recommendation is that: 1) the average update for 
prospective payment system hospitals located in urban areas 
for FY 1995 be equal to market basket rate of increase 
forecast minus 2.5 percentage points, 2) the update to the 
rural standardized amounts be sufficient to equate the rural 
with the other urban standardized amounts. Based on HCFA's 
current forecast of the market basket rate of increase 
(3.6 percent), we recommend an update for FY 1995 for urban 
hospitals equal to 1.1 percent (the market basket rate of 
increase minus 2.5 percentage points), and for rural 
hospitals equal to 8.4 percent (the market basket percentage 
increase plus 4.8 percentage points). Under these 
recommendations, we now estimate that the average update for 
all prospective payment system hospitals would be the market 
basket minus 1.4 percentage points, or approximately 2.2 
percent. As we have explained in section II of the Addendum 
to this proposed rule, our recommended updates would be 
applied to the unadjusted FY 1994 standardized payment 
amounts. That is, the FY 1994 standardized payment amounts 
published in our September 1, 1993 final rule (at 58 FR 
46362) would be increased to remove the effects of 
adjustments made for outliers and geographic 
reclassification before the recommended updates would be 
applied. 
Our recommendation is supported by the following 
analyses that measure changes in hospital productivity, 
scientific and technological advances, practice pattern 
changes, and changes in case mix: 
 

Productivity: 

Service level productivity is defined as 
the ratio of total service output to full time equivalent 
employees (FTEs). While we recognize that productivity is a 
function of many variables (for example, labor, non-labor 
material and capital inputs), we use a labor productivity 
measure in our framework, since the current update framework 
applies to operating payment. To recognize that we are 
apportioning the short run output changes to the labor 
input, we weight our productivity measure for operating 
costs by the appropriate share of labor input to total 
operating input to determine the expected effect on cost per 
case. 
Our recommendation for the service productivity 
component is based on historical trends in productivity and 
total output for both the hospital industry and the general 
economy, and projected levels of future hospital service 
output. ProPAC has also estimated cumulative service 
productivity growth to be 4.9 percent from 1985-1989 or 
1.2 percent annually. At the same time, they estimate total 
service growth at 3.4 percent annually, implying a ratio of 
service productivity growth to output growth of 0.35. Our 
MedPAR analysis indicates total Medicare service output 
(charges per admission, adjusted for CPI change) increased 
20.9 percent from 1985-1993, or an approximate average 
annual increase of 2.4 percent. Since it is not possible at 
this time to develop a productivity measure specific to 
Medicare patients, we examined productivity (output per 
hour) and output (gross domestic product) for the economy. 
Depending on the exact time period, annual changes in 
productivity range from 0.3 to 0.35 of the change in output 
(that is, a 1.0 percent increase in output would be 
correlated with an 0.3 to 0.35 percent change in output per 
hour). 
Under our framework, the recommended update is based in 
part on expected productivity_that is, projected service 
output during the year multiplied by the historical ratio of 
service productivity to total service output, multiplied by 
the share of labor in total operating inputs, as calculated 
in the hospital market basket rate of increase. This method 
estimates an expected labor productivity improvement in the 
same proportion to expected total service growth that has 
occurred in the past and assumes that, at a minimum, growth 
in FTEs changes proportionally to the growth in total 
service output. Thus, the recommendation allows for unit 
productivity to be smaller than the historical averages in 
years that output growth is relatively low, and higher in 
years that output growth is larger than the historical 
trend. Based on the above estimates from both the hospital 
industry and the economy, we have chosen to employ the range 
of ratios of productivity change to output change of 0.30 to 
0.35.

The expected change in total hospital service output is 
the product of projected growth in total admissions 
(adjusted for outpatient usage), projected real case-mix 
growth, and expected quality enhancing intensity growth, net 
of expected decline in intensity due to reduction of cost 
ineffective practice. Case-mix growth and intensity numbers 
for Medicare are used as proxies for those of the total 
hospital, since case-mix increases (used in the intensity 
measure as well) are unavailable for non-Medicare patients. 
Thus, expected output growth is simply the product of the 
expected change in intensity (0.0 percent), projected 
admissions change (3.2 percent for 1995) and projected real 
case-mix growth (1.0 to 1.4 percent for 1995), or 4.2 to 
4.6 percent. The share of direct labor services in the 
hospital market basket rate of increase (consisting of wages 
and salaries and employee benefits) is 61.7 percent. 
Multiplying the expected change in total hospital service 
output by the ratio of historical service productivity 
change to total service growth of 0.30 to 0.35 and by the 
direct labor share percentage provides our productivity 
standard of 0.8 to 1.0 percent. 
ProPAC also believes hospitals should be given an 
incentive for additional productivity improvement. ProPAC 
measures productivity as the ratio of hospital admissions 
(adjusted for case mix and outpatient services) per FTE 
employee (adjusted for changes in skill mix). ProPAC 
includes in its productivity measurement the effect of 
changes in practice patterns. We treat practice pattern 
changes as a portion of our intensity adjustment, described 
below. This year, ProPAC assumes a productivity gain of at 
least 1.4 percent and recommends a ^0.7 percentage point 
adjustment on the basis that any productivity gains should 
be shared equally by Medicare and hospitals. 
 

Intensity

: We base our intensity standard on the 
combined effect of three separate factors: changes in the 
use of quality enhancing services, changes in the use of 
services due to shifts in within-DRG severity, and changes 
in the use of services due to reductions of cost-ineffective 
practices. For 1995, we recommend an adjustment of 
0.0 percent. The basis of this recommendation is discussed 
below. 
We have no empirical evidence that accurately gauges 
the level of quality-enhancing technology changes. 
Typically, a specific new technology increases costs in some 
uses and decreases costs in other uses. Concurrently, 
health status is improved in some situations while in other 
situations it may be unaffected or even worsened using the 
same technology. It is difficult to separate out the 
relative significance of each of the cost-increasing effects 
for individual technologies and new technologies. 
The quality enhancing technology component is intended 
to recognize the use of services which increase cost but 
whose value in terms of enhanced health-status is 
commensurate with these costs. Such services may result 
from technological change, or in some cases, increased use 
of existing technologies. The latter recognizes that as 
cost and medical effectiveness studies become available, 
some increased use of existing, as well as new, services may 
be warranted. 
The component for reduction of cost-ineffective 
practice recognizes that some improvements in practice 
patterns could be made so that the intensity of services 
provided is more consistent with the efficient use of 
limited resources. That is, improvements could be made so 
that the number of services provided during an inpatient 
stay, and their complexity, produce an improvement in health 
status that is consistent with the cost of care. This 
component of our update recommendation is intended to 
encourage both hospitals and physicians to more carefully 
consider the cost-effectiveness of medical care. This 
component of the framework also accounts for real within-DRG 
change, since that should be directly reflected in the CMI- 
adjusted growth in real charges per case. 
We note that, since 1985, the intensity of services per 
inpatient admission has increased, even after adjusting for 
the growth in real case mix each year. These increases, 
which are similar to pre-prospective payment system 
increases, followed intensity decreases in both 1984 and 
1985. Following methods developed by HCFA's Office of the 
Actuary for deriving hospital output estimates from total 
hospital charges, ProPAC has estimated that case mix 
constant intensity per admission increased at an average of 
1.5 percent annually from 1985-1990. We have developed 
Medicare-specific intensity measures for inpatient services 
based on a five-year average using FY 1988-1993 MedPAR 
billing data. Consistent with ProPAC, case-mix constant 
intensity is calculated as the change in total Medicare 
charges per discharge adjusted for changes in the average 
charge per unit of service as measured by the Medical CPI 
hospital component, and changes in real case-mix. Past 
studies of case-mix change by the RAND Corporation indicate 
that the change in real case-mix ranges from 1.0 percent to 
1.4 percent per year. If we assume that real case-mix 
change is 1.4 percent per year, we estimate case-mix 
constant intensity to have declined by an average of 0.4 
percent each year during the FY 1988-1993 period, a 
cumulative decrease of 2.1 percent. If we assume that real 
case-mix has been growing at 1.0 percent annually, case-mix 
constant intensity has declined by an average of 0.1 percent 
annually, for a cumulative decrease of 0.6 percent. We note 
that regardless of which real case-mix number we assume (1.0 
or 1.4), we used the observed case-mix increase for FY 1993 
of 0.8 percent to calculate the real case-mix constant 
intensity. Since we estimate that intensity has declined 
during the FY 1988-1993 period, we are recommending a 0.0 
percent intensity adjustment for FY 1995.

Quality Enhancing New Science and Technology:

 Project Hope, under contract with ProPAC, annually estimates the incremental operating costs of specific cost-increasing
technologies. However, we know of no definitive studies that establish an appropriate level or range for this factor.
ProPAC's adjustment is for the cost-increasing effect of new technologies only, and this year assumes the estimated
costs for these technologies at only 0.3 percent.

We believe there may be several shortcomings with ProPAC's recommendations with regard to technology. First, the
estimate does not account for offsetting changes in revenue due to changes in DRG assignment. Second, it is not clear
that all of the new technologies listed in ProPAC's study significantly enhance health status. To the extent the new
technologies are not quality enhancing, an adjustment is inappropriate. Finally, some of the technologies have
considerable potential for cost savings relative to the technologies they are replacing.

 

Change in Case Mix:

 Our analysis takes into account projected changes in case-mix, adjusted for changes attributable to improved coding
practices. For our FY 1995 update recommendation, we are projecting a 1.5 percent increase in the case-mix index.
We define real case-mix change as actual changes in the mix (and resource requirements) of Medicare patients as opposed
to changes in coding behavior that result in assignment of cases to 
higher-weighted DRGs but do not reflect greater resource requirements. We estimate that 1.0 to 1.4 percent of the
projected case-mix increase of 1.5 percent will be real. This estimate is supported by past studies of case-mix change
by RAND Corporation. The most recent study by the RAND Corporation, ``Has DRG Creep Crept Up? Decomposing the Case
Mix Index Change Between 1987 and 1988'' by G.M. Carter, J.P. Newhouse and D.A. Relles, R-4098-HCFA/ProPAC
(1991), uses medical records from subsequent Federal fiscal years using consistent standards to determine real
case-mix change. The study specifically suggests that real case-mix change is not dependent on total change, but
instead is a fairly steady 1.0 to 1.5 percent per year. We use 1.4 percent as the upper bound because the RAND study did
not take into account that hospitals may have induced doctors to more completely document medical records so as to
improve payment. The resulting adjustment to account for changes in case mix during FY 1993, the most recent year for
which data are available, is ^0.1 to ^0.5 percent (subtracting the projected case-mix of 1.5 percent and adding real
case mix change of 1.0 to 1.4 percent). The 0.9 percent figure used in the ProPAC framework represents ProPAC's projection
for observed case-mix change, and its projection for real case-mix change, including within-DRG case complexity
change, during FY 1994. Consistent with ProPAC's framework, we are using a projection for case-mix change in our recommendation.

 

Effect of FY 1993 Reclassification and Recalibration:

 We estimate that DRG reclassification and recalibration for FY 1993 resulted in a 0.1 percent decrease in the case-mix
index when compared with the case-mix index that would have resulted if we had not made the reclassification and recalibration
changes to the GROUPER. ProPAC does not make an adjustment for DRG reclassification and recalibration in its update
recommendation (we note that Congress asks the Secretary for an estimate of these effects in our update recommendation).

 

Correction for Market Basket Forecast Error:

 The FY 1993 estimated market basket percentage increase used to update the payment rates was 4.1 percent. Our most
recent data indicate the actual FY 1993 increase was 2.9 percent, reflecting that the actual increase in wages was
lower than projected. The resulting forecast error in the projected FY 1993 market basket rate of increase forecast
is 1.2 percentage points. Our policy has been to make a forecast error correction if our estimate is off by 0.25 percentage

points or more. Therefore, we are recommending an adjustment of ^1.2 percentage points to reflect this overestimation
of the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase. The following is a summary of the update ranges supported by our analyses
compared to ProPAC's framework.

The above analysis supports our recommended update to the urban standardized amounts of the market basket rate of
increase (that is, 3.6 percent) minus 2.5 percentage points, or 1.1 percent. In addition, we believe a differential
update for the standardized amount applicable to rural hospitals is appropriate in order to phase out the differential
between the rural and other urban standardized amounts, as required by section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act. We
are recommending that the rural standardized amount be updated by the market basket plus 4.8 percentage points for
a total update of 8.4 percent. This recommendation is consistent with the President's budget, which includes an update
to the standardized amounts for rural hospitals of the market basket rate of increase plus the amount necessary to
eliminate the differential between the rural and other urban standardized amounts. 
We recommend that the hospital-specific rates applicable to sole community hospitals be increased by the update
factor that approximates that applicable for urban hospitals. We believe that the considerations used to develop
the update recommendations for the rural standardized amounts that would eliminate the difference between the rural
and other urban standardized amounts are not a relevant consideration for the hospital-specific rates. Therefore,
we are recommending an update to hospital-specific rates of the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage
points, which is consistent with current law and the President's budget. 


IV. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Rate-of-Increase Limits for Excluded Hospitals 


ProPAC recommends an update factor equal to the market basket rate of increase minus 1.0 percentage point for excluded
hospitals and units. The 1.0 percentage point reduction represents a reduction of 1.0 percentage point to account
for the forecast error in the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase for excluded units, no increase to reflect the different
compensation price proxies used by ProPAC, and no allowance for new technology. ProPAC no longer recommends an additional
allowance based on the year the hospital or unit was excluded from the prospective payment system, pending our report
to Congress on payment reform for excluded hospitals and units as mandated by Public Law 101- 508. 
Response: We recommend that hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system receive an update equal to the
percentage increase in the market basket that measures input price increases for services furnished by excluded
hospitals minus 1.0 percentage point. The reduction is consistent with the updates provided under current law and
in the President's Budget. The market basket rate of increase for excluded hospitals is currently forecast at 3.7
percent. Subtracting 1.0 percentage point would result in an update of 2.7 for excluded hospitals and units.

Appendix E: Development of Update Framework for Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Hospital Capital-Related
Costs 
I. Introduction 


For FY 1992 through FY 1995,  412.308(c)(1) provides that the update for the capital prospective payment rates
(Federal rate and hospital-specific rate) will be based on a 2-year moving average of actual increases in Medicare
inpatient capital costs per discharge. The regulations provide that, beginning in FY 1996, HCFA will determine the
update in the capital prospective payment rates based on an analytical framework that will take into account (1) changes
in the price of capital (which we will incorporate into a capital input price index), and (2) appropriate changes in
capital requirements resulting from development of new technologies and other factors (such as the diffusion of
existing technologies and existing hospital capacity and utilization). The objective of the capital update framework
is to determine a rate of increase in aggregate capital prospective payments that, along with a rate of increase in
DRG operating payments, ensures a joint flow of capital and operating services for efficient and effective care for
Medicare patients. 
Although the analytical framework will not be employed to determine the annual update factor until FY 1996, we are
presenting a series of preliminary models, using available data and concepts, of an update framework for the prospective
payment system for hospital inpatient capital-related costs. We have presented a series of models in our FY 1992,
FY 1993, and FY 1994 rulemaking documents. We received no comments on the most recent model of the framework, which
appeared in the September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46489). Below we discuss the current version of the model, based
on our previously published version and our continued analysis of the data and concepts incorporated into the framework.

The model update framework includes a capital input price index (CIPI) that parallels the operating input price index.
The CIPI measures the pure price changes associated with changes in capital-related costs (prices x ``quantities'').
The composition of capital-related costs is maintained at base-year FY 1987 proportions in the CIPI. As such, the
composition of capital reflects the underlying capital acquisition process. We selected FY 1987 as the base year
for this preliminary CIPI for consistency with the operating input price index. We would periodically update both
the operating and the capital input price indexes to reflect the changing composition of inputs for capital and operating
costs. We expect to have rebased the capital and operating input price indexes by the time we implement the final capital
update framework for FY 1996. The CIPI below illustrates the methodology we propose to employ. 
The model capital update framework, like the revised operating update framework, incorporates several policy adjustments
in addition to the CIPI. We would adjust for case-mix index-related changes, for intensity, and for the efficient
and cost-effective use of capital (such as movable equipment, buildings and fixed equipment) in the hospital industry,
as well as for error in the capital input price index forecast. 
In developing the model framework, we are attempting as much as possible to maintain consistency with the current
operating framework, in order to facilitate the eventual development of a single prospective payment system update
framework. We are also concerned with promoting the goals that motivated the adoption of the capital prospective
payment system, especially the goals of promoting more effective and efficient utilization of capital resources
in the hospital industry and establishing incentives for hospitals to make cost-effective decisions regarding
acquisition of new capital resources. 
It is important to emphasize that this presentation represents our current thinking, and that we continue to encourage
submission of comments and recommendations for further improvements. We are interested in suggestions regarding
the CIPI, the proposed policy adjustment factor for intensity, and alternative methodologies for deriving the factors.
We also welcome information concerning empirical studies and sources of data that could be useful in developing the
framework. We will consider comments and recommendations on any aspect of the model framework in making further developments
for presentation in the next version of the model. Our plan is to consider comments received on this model for inclusion
in one further preliminary model to be included in this year's final rule for the prospective payment system. We will
then formally propose an analytical update framework for implementation in FY 1996 during the rulemaking process
for that year. 


II. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Capital Prospective Payment System Federal Rate 


ProPAC recommends the use of an update framework that includes a capital market basket component that measures 1-year
changes in the purchase prices of a fixed basket of capital goods purchased by hospitals (Recommendation 10). The
ProPAC framework also includes several policy adjustment factors. A forecast error correction factor adjusts payment
rates so that the effects of past errors are not perpetuated. A financing policy adjustment accounts for the effects
of substantial deviations from long-term trends in interest rates on hospital capital costs. The capital update
framework also includes adjustments for scientific and technological advances, productivity, and case-mix change
similar to those employed in the ProPAC operating update framework. 
In Recommendation 11, ProPAC also recommends the development and use of a combined update framework for the prospective
payment systems for operating and capital-related costs for FY 1995. 


Response:

 Our long-term goal is to develop a single prospective payment system update framework. Currently, the regulations
provide for the determination of the capital prospective payment update by means of a lagged 2-year average of actual
Medicare capital cost increases. Once we have completed work on an analytical framework for the capital prospective
payment update, we will begin to study development of a unified framework. In the meantime, we will continue to maintain
consistency as much as possible with the current operating framework in order to facilitate the eventual development
of a unified framework. 
The basic objectives of the ProPAC and HCFA update frameworks are compatible. The goal of each framework is to provide
a rate of increase in capital prospective payments that, along with the rate of increase in operating prospective
payments, will ensure a flow of capital and operating resources that will allow for efficient and effective care for
Medicare patients. Both frameworks are designed to provide increases for the purchase of quality-enhancing new
technologies. Both frameworks provide for case-mix adjustments to remove the effects of upcoding and to adjust for
changes in within-DRG severity. Both frameworks also seek to encourage efficient capital spending behavior and
to adjust the overall size of capital stock to appropriate levels. Although the frameworks adopt different methodologies
for promoting some of these goals, they are philosophically compatible to the degree that they share these goals.

However, there is one significant philosophical 
difference between the ProPAC and HCFA frameworks. ProPAC's 
framework is based on the premise that capital prospective 
payments are for future capital purchases. Thus, ProPAC's 
proposed capital market basket reflects the projected 
increase in the purchase price of capital goods from one 
year to the next. To put it another way, the market basket 
under the ProPAC framework reflects the price of replacing 
current capital stock at future prices. 

HCFA's framework is based on the premise that capital 
prospective payments are for hospitals' future capital-related expenses rather than for future capital-related

purchases. That is, HCFA's framework addresses the expenses 
associated with hospitals' given stock of capital in a 
particular fiscal year; ProPAC's framework ignores 
hospitals' present stock of capital and focuses on costs of 
capital purchases that hospitals will make in a particular 
fiscal year. 

There is a sound economic reason why the current 
purchase price of capital assets alone is an inadequate 
measure of the price of capital. The crucial distinguishing 
feature of capital assets is that they are consumed over 
time. A satisfactory measure of the change in capital input 
prices must therefore account for this fact. Consideration 
of the costs for all capital currently in use for patient 
care, not just the costs for current capital purchases, is 
necessary for this purpose. The ProPAC index cannot 
adequately capture this aspect of changes in capital input 
prices. 

In addition to our disagreement with ProPAC over the 
basic purpose of the CIPI, we also disagree over the 
treatment of interest. The pure price aspects of interest 
costs (that is, the interest rate and the purchase price 
that is represented in the amount of loan principal) are 
beyond the control of the hospital industry. To be sure, 
the actual decision to purchase capital assets or acquire 
debt is a ``quantity'' decision and typically is discretionary 
for a particular span of time. However, measuring the 
actual expected price per unit of real capital, 
independently of any evaluation of the propriety of any 
actual purchase decisions, is essential to recognize that 
the industry has control over the amount of capital it 
purchases but no control over the price it pays for capital. 
Thus, the pure price aspect of interest cost changes must be 
incorporated into the CIPI. Otherwise, the CIPI will not 
accurately reflect the prices faced by hospitals who must 
borrow to finance necessary capital acquisitions. 
Limitations on the quantity of capital are appropriately 
implemented through policy adjustment factors. The ProPAC 
approach artificially eliminates pure price changes related 
to interest costs from the CIPI and incorporates them into a 
discretionary adjustment factor. The HCFA CIPI retains all 
price components of increase in interest costs as one 
measure of inflation in capital-related expenses. It 
thereby keeps price and quantity aspects distinct, allowing 
separate analysis of each factor of increases in capital 
expenses. 

We provide further comments on particular ProPAC 
recommendations in sections III and IV of this appendix. 
The ProPAC recommendations concerning the methodology for 
recognizing increases due to quality-enhancing new 
technology and the case-mix index adjustment are discussed 
in Appendix D in the context of the update recommendation 
for the prospective payment system for operating costs. 



III. Measurement of Capital Input Price Increases 



A. Introduction 



HCFA proposed a capital input price index as one 
component in developing future update factors for the 
Federal rate in the September 1, 1992 

Federal Register

 (57 
FR 40016). We have presented revised versions of the 
capital input price index in the May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30448) 
and September 1, 1993 (58 FR 46490) issues of the 

Federal 
Register.

 The developing capital input price index 
parallels the operating input price index. Both the 
developing capital input price index and the operating input 
price index are designed to measure input price changes for 
hospitals' current year expenses, that is, to separate pure 
price changes from quantity and expenditure changes. The 
operating sector input price index measures input price 
changes for operating-related expenses. The capital input 
price index measures input price changes for capital-related 
expenses. Capital-related expenses include depreciation, 
interest, and other expenses (taxes and insurance related to 
capital goods.) 



B. Review of the HCFA Capital Input Price Index Methodology 



The current version of the CIPI is based on the 
following assumptions:

 


 The Federal rate is based on the concept of capital-
related expenses of capital assets used for patient care in 
the fiscal year and, therefore, any change in the Federal 
rate should take into account expected changes in the input 
price aspects of capital-related expenses; 

 Capital-related expenses are defined as the sum of 
depreciation expense, capital-related interest costs, and 
other capital-related costs, including taxes, insurance, and 
leases; and 

 The input prices related to capital-related expenses 
are beyond the control of the hospital industry (that is, 
the hospital is a price-taker, not a price-setter). 




These assumptions lead directly to a definition of a 
CIPI that takes into account the price aspects of changes in 
depreciation expense, interest costs, and other capital-related costs. Further, the assumptions lead directly
to 
input prices for depreciation expense and interest costs 
which, unlike operating costs, have a time dimension that 
must be captured in the CIPI. HCFA includes three 
categories of capital-related expenses in the CIPI: 
depreciation expense, interest costs, and other capital-related costs (taxes and insurance).

Current depreciation expenses represent the summed 
depreciation charges for all past purchases of fixed capital 
assets that are still depreciable in the current period. 
The input prices associated with these depreciation expenses 
are the purchase prices attached to all past and current 
capital purchases for capital still depreciable in the 
current period. A weighted average of these purchase prices 
thus represents the input price associated with depreciation 
expenses in the current period. Thus, the depreciation 
input price for the current period measures price aspects of 
current depreciation expenses for capital just as the 
operating input price index for the current period measures 
price aspects of current operating expenses for labor and 
non-capital goods and services. The depreciation input 
price differs from the operating input price in that the 
depreciation input price is a composite of all past capital 
purchase prices while the operating index input price 
measures purchase prices for current periods only. 

Current interest expenses represent the total interest 
charges for all still-active past debt instruments 
associated with the purchase of fixed capital assets. The 
input prices associated with these interest expenses are the 
interest rates attached to all past debt instruments that 
are still active in the current period. A weighted average 
of these interest rates thus represents the input price 
associated with interest expenses in the current period. 
Thus, the interest input price for the current period 
measures price aspects of current interest expenses just as 
the operating input price index for the current period 
measures price aspects of current operating expenses for 
labor and non-capital goods and services. The interest 
input price differs from the operating input price in that 
the depreciation input price is a composite of all past 
interest rates for debt instruments still active while the 
operating index input price measures purchase prices for 
current periods only. 

Current year capital-related expenses for taxes and 
insurance have an annual time dimension and, therefore, 
prices associated with these expenses are, like operating 
input prices, current year prices only. 



C. Revisions to the Depreciation Component of the CIPI 



A commenter on a previous version of the CIPI 
recommended that constant annual weights for capital price 
proxies be replaced by variable annual weights that reflect 
the vintage purchases of capital. The commenter pointed out 
that annual purchases of real capital tend to increase over 
time. As annual purchases of capital increase, the later 
years in the moving average of depreciation costs should be 
weighted more heavily than the earlier years. 

We agree with this comment. Accordingly, a special 
data base was prepared to provide appropriate historical 
weights for depreciation and interest input prices. The 
data base starts with financial variables from the American 
Hospital Association (AHA) Panel Survey. These are enhanced 
with data from Medicare cost reports and from the Department 
of Commerce Capital Expenditure Survey. The data base 
provides annual estimates of nominal purchases for building 
and fixed equipment and for movable equipment. Leasing 
amounts were converted to nominal purchases using the same 
relationships as appear for owner-operated capital. Nominal 
purchases were then converted to annual real (that is, 
constant dollar) purchases by dividing nominal expenditures 
by an appropriate purchase price proxy. 

Expected life for building and fixed equipment and for 
movable equipment were derived from Medicare cost reports by 
dividing book value of assets by current year depreciation 
amounts. The relative distribution of real capital 
purchases within the respective life for building and fixed 
equipment (25 years) and for movable equipment (10 years) 
were derived from the special data base. These relative 
distributions are shown in Table 1. Relative distributions 
for a number of different time periods were averaged to 
obtain the distributions in Table 1. These distributions 
were all very similar regardless of the periods chosen and, 
therefore, we selected an average of the distributions in 
order to simplify the calculations.

Table 2 shows the historical percentage changes in the capital price proxies employed in the CIPI. These proxies are:
the building cost index maintained by the Engineering News-Record (ENR) for the costs of fixed assets; the machinery
and equipment component of the Producer Price Index (PPI-11) for moveable equipment; the average yield on domestic
municipal bonds from the Bond Buyer index of 20 bonds (Muni); the average yield on Moody's corporate bonds (AAA); a
composite of Muni and AAA indexes (Combined Muni/AAA); and the residential rent component of the Consumer Price Index
(CPI Rent) for other capital costs. 

We applied the relative weights from Table 1 to the appropriate historical percent changes in capital price proxies
listed in Table 2 to generate the current year prices for the CIPI depreciation sector listed in Table 3. 
For example, the FY 1995 moveable equipment index component percentage change of 1.9 percent in Table 3 represents
the average of the percentage changes in the moveable equipment price proxy (PPI-11 in Table 2) for the previous
10 years (that is, FY 1985 through 1994), weighted by the relative weights listed for movable equipment in Table 1.

The stability of the HCFA vintage-weighted CIPI 
compared to annual changes in capital purchase prices is 
portrayed graphically in Figures 1 and 2. As we have 
discussed in connection with previous versions of the CIPI, 
stability is an important criterion for evaluating such an 
index. This is because excessive volatility in a price 
index deprives the index of predictability, and thus 
inhibits the ability of institutions to plan for changes in 
capital payments resulting from changes in the CIPI. 













ProPAC recommends a capital input price index based on 
annual changes in current capital purchase prices excluding 
consideration of weighted historical capital purchase 
prices. We previously argued that the ProPAC index was not 
logically consistent with the operating input index that is 
currently used to assist updating DRG payment rates. We 
would add that the volatility in annual purchase prices 
shown in Figures 1 and 2 would introduce an unacceptable 
degree of volatility in prospective capital payments. 


D. Revisions to the Interest Price Component of the CIPI 


Another commenter on a previous version of the CIPI 
recommended that data from Securities Data Inc. be 
incorporated into the CIPI interest computations. This 
source provides information on hospital issuances of 
municipal and commercial bonds. From this data base, we 
incorporated information that shows that the average 
expected life of hospital bond debt instruments (that is, 
the time interval between the issue date and the maturation 
date) was about 13 years for municipal serial bonds and 
about 25 years for municipal term bonds. The weighted 
average life for the 2 types of bonds was 22 years. 
The relative nominal capital purchases within various 
22-year periods provided appropriate annual weights for 
annual changes in interest rates. Not all capital purchases 
are funded by debt. Medicare cost reports suggest that 
about 80 percent of new capital acquisitions are financed by 
debt and about 20 percent by equity financing. However, if 
the proportion of total purchases financed by debt does not 
change substantially from year to year, then it is 
irrelevant whether we use the full amount or a constant 
proportion of the full amount of nominal capital 
acquisitions as weights for relative amounts of the debt 
instruments still active in the current period. 
Relative interest weights derived from our procedure 
are shown in Table 1. When combined with percent changes in 
annual interest rates from Table 2, the weights provide a 
current year estimates of interest rate changes in the CIPI 
in Table 3. Thus, for example, the interest rate component 
change of ^3.2 percent in Table 3 for FY 1995 represents the 
average of the previous 22 years in the interest rate proxy 
(Combined Muni/AAA) in Table 2, weighted by the interest 
weights listed in Table 1. We use a percent change in a 
combined municipal and AAA commercial bond interest rate 
(shown in Table 2 as Combined Muni/AAA), giving the 
municipal rate an 85 percent weight and the AAA rate a 15 
percent weight, reflecting the relative hospital debts of 
the government/non-profit hospital sector and the for-profit 
sector.

The stability of HCFA's vintage-weighted interest rate 
compared to annual changes in interest rates is portrayed in 
Figure 3. 



















As we have discussed in connection with previous versions of 
the model, stability is an important criterion for 
evaluating the CIPI because it provides an important degree 
of predictability to the index. 
Although Medicare cost reports show that only 60 
percent of current hospital debt is in the form of notes or 
bonds (about 40 percent is in the form of mortgages), we 
assumed that the relative annual weights for all debt and 
the relative annual changes in interest rates for all debt 
were the same as bond-related weights and price changes. We 
are still searching for an appropriate source of information 
on hospital commercial mortgage data. We do not expect that 
the discovery of such data will materially alter our current 
conclusions about trends in effective interest rates over 
time.

A third commenter on a previous version of the CIPI 
recommended that we investigate the effects on interest rate 
changes of changing structures of hospital bond ratings. If 
bond ratings are deteriorating, hospitals incur higher 
interest rates; if bond ratings improve, hospitals incur 
lower interest rates. Our CIPI currently recognizes only 
changes in pure interest rates and does not recognize 
changes in effective interest rates due to changes in bond 
ratings. 
We examined a hospital municipal bond data base from 
Securities Data Inc. to examine this issue. This data 
showed that serial bonds dominated short-term bonds and term 
bonds dominated long-term bonds (Figure 4). We classified 
all bond amounts by ratings found in the data base for the 
years 1980 to 1992. We defined bonds rated as Baa1 or above 
as ``Investment Grade'' bonds; all others were ``Non-Investment 
Grade''. The percentage distribution of the issuance-amount-rated bonds in Figure 5 (percentage amounts applied
to 
dollar amount of debt issuance) indicates no discernible 
trend in upward or downward ratings over the period. We 
conclude that there is no evidence to justify a component 
for deteriorating bond ratings in the CIPI. 


















E. Projection of the CIPI for Fiscal Year 1995 


We project a 0.9 percent increase in the CIPI for FY 
1995 (Table 3 and Figure 6). This is the outcome of a 3.1 
percent increase in projected weighted depreciation prices 
in FY 1995 offset by a 3.6 percent decline in vintage- 
weighted interest rates in FY 1995. 


F. ProPAC Input Price Index 


1. Introduction 


Three major differences distinguish ProPAC's CIPI from 
HCFA's CIPI: 
 The ProPAC CIPI measures changes in capital asset 
purchase prices in the year the asset is purchased. HCFA's 
CIPI is designed to measure changes in a vintage-weighted 
composite of capital asset purchase prices. 
 The ProPAC CIPI uses capital asset purchase price 
proxies that differ from HCFA's.

<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00223 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The ProPAC CIPI has no interest component. PROPAC 
treats interest rate changes as a separate update factor 
component. Through 1995, for example, ProPAC expects that 
long term interest rates will remain stable and, therefore, 
believes that it is not appropriate to adjust capital 
payments for forecasted changes in interest rates in the 
target year. 

HCFA incorporates a vintage-weighted composite of 
interest rates in its CIPI for the target year. 



















2. Depreciation 



ProPAC states that its CIPI is analogous to the 
prospective payment operating price index. We disagree. 
The components of the operating index represent price 
changes in ongoing hospital expenses for labor and non- 
capital goods and services. The analogous capital expenses 
in this context are current depreciation costs, interest 
costs and other capital-related expenses (taxes and 
insurance). Current depreciation and interest costs are a 
cumulative composite of segments of expenses incurred in 
current and prior periods. Current interest costs are a 
cumulative composite of segments of past and current year 
debt costs. Since both depreciation and interest costs have 
a vintage component, the price aspect of these costs must 
have a vintage component as well. The HCFA CIPI attempts to 
capture these vintage components.

Differences between HCFA and ProPAC with respect to 
choices for annual rates of change in capital purchase price 
proxies appear to be minimal: 

 Changes in alternative price proxies for building and 
fixed equipment are nearly coincidental (Table 3 and Figure 
7). We are still considering adoption of the price proxy 
recommended by ProPAC, but we do not anticipate any material 
difference in the HCFA CIPI if we do adopt this alternative 
proxy. 






















</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00225 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Changes in alternative price proxies for moveable equipment, although not as close as those for building and
fixed equipment, are nevertheless nearly coincidental for much of the historical period (Table 3 and Figure 8). 

As noted in our September 1, 1992 final rule, one basic criterion for accepting price proxies is public availability
of documentation on data sources and methodology (57 FR 40018-40019). Despite repeated efforts, neither we
nor Data Resources Inc. have been able to obtain documentation on the moveable price proxy recommended by ProPAC that
explains how it is derived and what sampling frame and sampling error attach to the estimates. In the absence of such
information we cannot adopt the ProPAC alternative. 

HCFA's assumption is that prices for hospital moveable equipment change at about the same rate as general prices for
all machinery and equipment. This assumption is justified in part by the fact that not all moveable equipment purchased
by hospitals is medical equipment: it stands to reason that the prices for non-medical equipment purchased by hospitals
would change at the same rate as prices for all machinery and equipment. To examine this assumption further, we measured
the rate of change in the HCFA moveable price proxy relative to prices for medical equipment only by preparing a composite
index of medical prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index (PPI) for two commodity categories_medical
instruments/equipment and X-ray/electro-medical equipment. 
The two PPI commodity indexes were then merged using their respective PPI weights. Price change trends for the period
for which information is available are shown in Table 3 and Figure 8 (Inset). Price changes for this index are not available
for years prior to 1984. Annual price changes for medical equipment were less than the annual HCFA price proxy in all
but the most recent 2 years and were about the same as the ProPAC price proxy in the last 2 years. The medical equipment
price was substantially less than the ProPAC index for most of the historical period. We will continue to monitor trends
in these indexes to ensure that appropriate price proxies are incorporated in the CIPI. 


3. Interest 

ProPAC has proposed to project annual interest rates to future periods and then to decide whether to allow an add-on
to the Federal capital rate depending on the magnitude of the projection. ProPAC has presented no objective criteria
for determining when an interest adjustment is appropriate. We previously noted that a single-year projection for
interest rates is conceptually inappropriate since interest costs must be vintage-weighted. In addition to this
conceptual problem, the ProPAC approach is impractical because future annual interest rates are volatile, vulnerable
to unpredictable market forces, and subject to exogenous influences (such as Federal Reserve Board decisions) that
are difficult to anticipate. Thus, any projection of future interest rates is likely to be inaccurate, resulting
in underpayment or overpayment of the Federal capital rate relative to the capital-related expenses that the rate
is supposed to compensate. The resulting uncertainty in payments under future Federal capital rates further complicates
future capital expenditure decisions by hospitals. On the other hand, the projected HCFA CIPI interest component
for the target year is the weighted average change over 22 years of interest rate history, of which 20 years experience
is historical. The projected experience in the HCFA index for the most recent 2 years may be as inaccurate as any ProPAC
projection, but any error will have minimal effects on Federal rates due to the appropriately weighted effect of the
historical data in the HCFA CIPI. This stability in the interest rate component of the HCFA CIPI provides hospital
planners with a degree of certainty about future Federal rate payments, other things remaining equal. Annual and
weighted annual rates of change are compared in Table 3. 


4. The Composite HCFA CIPI 

Annual percentage changes in the historical and projected HCFA and ProPAC CIPIs differ markedly (Figure 9). The ProPAC
CIPI is much more volatile than the HCFA CIPI in the historical period through 1993 because it has no vintage-weighted
capital input price factors for depreciation.

<TEXT>
 

Further, the ProPAC CIPI omits interest rates. The 
cumulative effect of declining interest rates for all debt 
instruments in recent years has driven the rate of change in 
the HCFA interest rate component downward, a trend projected 
into future rate years. The declining interest rate 
component drags the HCFA CIPI below the ProPAC CIPI in the 
projection period. Other things being equal, the ProPAC 
index would result in overpayment through the Federal rate 
because anticipated actual capital-related expenses will be 
less than ProPAC projects due to the effects of lower 
interest rates on capital-related expenses. 



IV. Case-Mix Adjustment and Adjustment for Forecast Error 



The case-mix index (CMI) is the measure of the average 
DRG weight for cases paid under the prospective payment 
system. Because the DRG weight determines the prospective 
payment for each case, any percentage increase in the CMI 
corresponds to an equal percentage increase in hospital 
payments. 

The CMI can change for any of several reasons: because 
the average resource use of Medicare patients changes 
(``real'' case-mix change), because changes in hospital coding 
of patient records result in higher weight DRG assignments 
(``coding effects''), and because the annual DRG 
reclassification and recalibration changes may not be budget 
neutral (``reclassification effect''). In the update 
framework for the prospective payment system for operating 
costs, we adjust the update upwards to allow for real case- 
mix change, but remove the effects of coding changes on the 
CMI. We also remove the effect on total payments of prior 
changes to the DRG classifications and relative weights, in 
order to retain budget neutrality for all CMI-related 
changes other than patient severity. (For example, we 
adjusted for the effects of the FY 1992 DRG reclassification 
and recalibration as part of our FY 1994 update 
recommendation.) The operating adjustment consists of a 
reduction for total observed case-mix change, an increase 
for the portion of case-mix change that we determine is due 
to real case-mix change rather than coding modifications, 
and an adjustment for the effect of prior DRG 
reclassification and recalibration changes. We proposed to 
adopt this CMI adjustment as well in the capital update 
framework. 

We received no comments on the proposed CMI adjustment. 
The current operating update framework contains an 
adjustment for forecast error. The input price index 
forecast is based on historical trends and relationships 
ascertainable at the time the update factor is established 
for the following year. In any given year there can be 
unanticipated price fluctuations that can result in 
differences between the actual increase in prices faced by 
hospitals and the forecast used in calculating the update 
factors. We continue to believe that the capital update 
framework should include a forecast error adjustment factor. 
In setting a prospective payment rate under the proposed 
framework, we would make an adjustment for forecast error 
only if our estimate of the capital input price index rate 
of increase for any year is off by 0.25 percentage points or 
more. There is a 2-year lag between the forecast and the 
measurement of the forecast error. Thus, for example, we 
would adjust for a forecast error made in FY 1996 through an 
adjustment to the FY 1998 update. 

We received no comments on the proposed forecasting 
error adjustment. 



V. Policy Adjustment Factors 


The capital input price index measures the pure price 
changes associated with changes in capital-related costs 
(prices x ``quantities''). The composition of capital-related 
costs is maintained at base-year 1987 proportions in the 
capital input price index. We would address appropriate 
changes in the amount and composition of capital stock 
through the policy adjustment factors. 

The current update framework for the prospective 
payment system for operating costs includes factors designed 
to adjust the input price index rate of increase for policy 
considerations. Under the revised operating framework, we 
adjust for service productivity (the efficiency with which 
providers produce individual services such as laboratory 
tests and diagnostic procedures) and intensity (the amount 
of services used to produce a discharge). The service 
productivity factor for the operating update framework 
reflects a forward-looking adjustment for the changes that 
hospitals can be expected to make in service-level 
productivity during the year. A hospital retains any 
productivity increases above the average. 


The intensity factor for the operating update framework 
reflects how hospital services are utilized to produce the 
final product, that is, the discharge. This component 
accounts for changes in the use of quality-enhancing 
services, changes in within-DRG severity, and expected 
modification of practice patterns to remove cost-ineffective 
services. We originally proposed that the intensity 
adjustment factor in the revised operating framework be 
adopted in the capital update framework. That factor 
remains a part of our developing framework. Under the 
revised operating update framework, we calculate case-mix 
constant intensity as the change in total charges per 
admission, adjusted for price level changes (the CPI 
hospital component) and changes in real case mix. The use 
of total charges in the calculation of the proposed 
intensity factor makes it a total intensity factor, that is, 
charges for capital services are already built into the 
calculation of the factor. We can therefore incorporate the 
proposed intensity adjustment from the operating update 
framework into the capital update framework. In the absence 
of reliable estimates of the proportions of the overall 
annual intensity increases that are due, respectively, to 
ineffective practice patterns and to the combination of 
quality-enhancing new technologies and within-DRG 
complexity, we would assume, as in the revised operating 
update framework, that one-half of the annual increase is 
due to each of these factors. The capital update framework 
would thus provide an add-on to the input price index rate 
of increase of one-half of the estimated annual increase in 
intensity to allow for within-DRG severity increases and the 
adoption of quality-enhancing technology.

In our previous discussions of an efficiency 
adjustment, we suggested that the adjustment should take 
into account two considerations. One is that capital 
inputs, unlike operating inputs, are generally fixed in the 
short run. The productivity target in the revised operating 
framework operates on a short-term, year-to-year basis. 
Targets for capital efficiency and cost-effectiveness, 
however, must operate on a longer term basis. The other 
consideration is that, prior to the adoption of the capital 
prospective payment system, Medicare payment policy for 
capital-related costs, as well as the policies of other 
payers, did not provide sufficient incentives for efficient 
and cost-effective capital spending. As a result, capital 
costs per case, and therefore base year prospective capital 
rates, may be higher than would have been consistent with 
capital acquisition policy in more efficiency-oriented 
markets. A guiding principle in devising an efficiency 
adjustment is therefore that Medicare capital prospective 
payment rates should not provide for maintenance of capital 
in excess of the level that would be produced in an 
efficiency-oriented competitive market. 

As a preliminary examination of this issue, we analyzed 
the change in actual Medicare capital cost per case for FYs 
1986-1991 in relation to the change in the capital input 
price index (which accounts for change in the input prices 
for capital-related costs), and the other adjustment factors 
that we were then proposing to include in the framework. 
(The other adjustment factors are the increase in real case 
mix and the increase in intensity due to quality-enhancing 
technological change and within-DRG complexity.) We found 
rates of increase in spending per case that exceeded the 
rate of increase attributable to inflation in capital input 
prices, quality-enhancing intensity increases, and real 
case-mix growth. 


Economic theory suggests that an industry with a 
guaranteed return on capital (such as the hospital industry 
prior to prospective payment for capital-related costs) 
would have a tendency to be overly capitalized relative to 
more competitive industries. This is because the incentive 
for firms in such an industry is to compete on the basis of 
more capital-intensive production processes than firms in 
other industries. As a result, capital costs per case, and 
therefore base year prospective capital rates, may be higher 
than would have been consistent with capital acquisition 
policy in more efficiency-oriented competitive markets. 


Our analysis was designed to examine whether hospitals 
had in fact responded to the incentives of the cost-based 
reimbursement system for capital by expanding beyond what 
was necessary for efficient and cost-effective delivery of 
services. The analysis confirmed that volume and intensity 
of capital acquisition far outpaced the increase in capital 
input prices during the years between the implementation of 
the prospective payment system for operating costs and the 
introduction of the capital prospective payment system. 
Even accounting for real CMI increases and increases in 
intensity attributable to cost-increasing but quality-enhancing new technologies, there remains a large excess
of 
capital-related spending. 


The following table shows the results of our most 
recent analysis, based on the most current data available 
and the most recent projections. Differences between this 
table and the tables in previous discussions in the 

Federal 
Register 

are due to revised figures for average capital cost 
per case increases, based on the most recent data and 
projections, and on our revised CIPI. We have also expanded 
the analysis incorporated in this table to include FY 1985 
and FY 1992, thus encompassing all but 1 year of the period 
from the implementation of the prospective payment system 
for operating costs to the implementation of the prospective 
payment system for capitals costs. (For FY 1984, sufficient 
data is not available to compute capital cost per case 
increases and intensity increases.) The results of the 
analysis in Table 4 are substantially similar to the results 
of previous analyses. In Table 4 real case-mix increase is 
assumed to be 1.0 percent annually.

We believe that the adjustment for capital efficiency 
and cost-effectiveness should take into account the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the capital resources 
present in the base year for the capital prospective payment 
system. We do not believe that Medicare capital payment 
rates should provide for maintenance of capital in excess of 
the level that would be produced in an efficiency-oriented 
competitive market. The capital efficiency adjustment 
should be designed to give hospitals an incentive to reduce 
inefficiency and ineffectiveness in capital resources. The 
analysis in Table 4 suggests that, in order to restore the 
Federal rate to the level at which it would have been if 
capital costs had not been excessive in the years before the 
implementation of capital prospective payment, a cumulative 
reduction in the rate of 28.2 percent (1.565/2.088=.7495, or -25.0 percent) is justified. 


We note that the Administration's Health Security Act 
contains a proposal for an annual adjustment to the capital 
update for FY 1996 through FY 2003. This proposal is based 
in part on our previous analysis of capital spending in the 
years prior to the implementation of the capital prospective 
payment system. Section 4103(a)(2)(C) of the proposed 
Health Security Act provides that the annual update factor 
applied to the capital prospective payment system rates be 
reduced by 4.9 percent each year during that period (except 
that the change factor can never be negative in any year).

Executive Summary


In this report, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) discusses major factors that have influenced
how hospitals have evolved, looks at how hospitals have responded to changes in the health care environment, and suggests
the future direction hospitals may take. The Commission also presents 23 recommendations covering a range of topics,
from broad issues concerning Medicare and health care reform to updating Medicare payment rates and refining certain
aspects of Medicare payments to hospitals and other facilities. The report is submitted directly to the Congress,
although the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to respond to the Commission's recommendations.
ProPAC's responsibilities have expanded from its original mandate of advising the Congress and the Secretary on
the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for hospitals. These additional responsibilities include analyzing
and developing prospective payment policies for all facility services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries and
examining Medicaid hospital payment rates. In the past year, the Commission has submitted reports to the Congress
on Medicare and the American health care system, global budgeting, and Medicaid disproportionate share payment
adjustments. ProPAC, however, continues to devote substantial effort to updating and improving Medicare policies
for paying hospitals.


The Future of Hospitals


Hospitals_the central institutions in the American health care system_have long been the sole source of technology-oriented
acute health care for the most complex cases. But because technological capabilities were limited, until the last
20 years or so one hospital was much like another. Each provided its community with essentially the same range of services
and was structured in a similar manner. Today, hospitals offer a rich mix of complex, intensive services to a variety
of patients. Relationships among hospitals, other institutional providers, and payers have become more complex,
characterized by a broad range of ownership arrangements and the sharing of financial risk. Additionally, the role
physicians play in hospitals' operations has evolved markedly.
Two major forces_advances in medical technology and changes in financing mechanisms_have profoundly influenced
the evolution of hospitals. Technological innovations not only have expanded the services hospitals furnish, but
also have resulted in greater competition from other providers. The emergence of third-party payers has created
a stream of revenues that financed these innovations.
As health spending has outpaced inflation, both public and private payers have sought ways to curb this growth. Medicare,
for instance, has made radical changes in payment mechanisms to constrain the rise in government payments to hospitals.
Private payers, too, have used various strategies to control the growth in payments, but with mixed success. For their
part, hospitals have minimized cost-containment pressure by generating additional payments from private payers,
a practice called ``cost shifting.''
How each hospital has evolved in response to technological advances, financing changes, and other developments
has depended on its internal and external environments. The end result has been significant diversification in the
hospital industry.
Hospitals will continue to encounter technological and financing changes. The greatest unknown, however, is the
outcome of the current health care debate and how hospitals will fare under reform. Since they account for the largest
portion of total health spending, hospitals will bear much of the pressure to alter the way care is delivered and paid
for in the future. Hospitals' responses to these changes will differ, depending on the source and stringency of the
pressure, and the circumstances facing each facility.


Summary of Recommendations


In Chapter 2, ProPAC presents 23 recommendations reflecting the Commission's concerns regarding health reform
and Medicare payment policies. The Commission believes these proposed changes are necessary for maintaining access
to quality health care, encouraging productivity and cost effectiveness in the provision of care, and improving
payment equity. The Commission developed its recommendations by setting priorities, analyzing information, and
deliberating on the implications of alternative policies. ProPAC also pays close attention to the concerns of the
Congress, the Administration, health care providers, third-party payers, enrollees, and the public. The Commission's
recommendations are offered to comply with ProPAC's statutory mandate and to contribute to an informed, open debate
about Medicare payment policies. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission's recommendations focused on three broad
areas:
 Medicare and health care reform,
 Payment updates, and
 Other payment policies.
Medicare and Health Care Reform

_The health care industry is facing major challenges as policy makers and legislators struggle to control health
care expenditures and expand coverage to people without insurance. Several proposals have been introduced to reform
the health care system. Some of these focus on incremental changes in the financing and delivery of health care; others
call for fundamental restructuring of the existing system. Most include provisions that would affect the Medicare
program.
The Health Security Act introduced by the President would fundamentally change the financing and delivery of health
care. Under this proposal, most people under 65 would obtain health insurance coverage through regional or corporate
alliances that would negotiate with health plans to provide medical services. Managed competition among plans is
expected to control the growth in health care expenditures. As a contingency, however, premium rate increases would
be limited if expenditure growth were not contained. Medicare would be retained as a separate program, although it
would be subject to a number of changes and cost-saving measures.
In this report, the Commission comments on specific features of the Health Security Act and other health reform activities
as they pertain to the Medicare program. This discussion is found in Recommendations 1 through 8.


Payment Updates


Recommendations 9 through 14 present the Commission's recommended updates to the payment amounts to various facilities.
These include operating and capital payments to hospitals paid under PPS, operating payments to facilities excluded
from PPS, and the composite rate for dialysis services.
In examining each of these Medicare payment systems, the Commission recommends to the Congress an appropriate update
amount for fiscal year 1995 payments. In addition, ProPAC considers the appropriateness of the base payment rate
to which the update factor would be applied.
The Commission is mandated by law to submit to the Congress each year the appropriate update to the inpatient hospital
operating payment rates under PPS. ProPAC considers several factors in developing this update: the hospital market
basket index, scientific and technological advances, hospital productivity, case-mix change, and the quality
and long-term cost-effectiveness of health care. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission recommends an average update
of 2.7 percent to the standardized payment amounts: an increase of 2.2 percent for urban hospitals and of 5.3 percent
for rural hospitals.
ProPAC's update recommendation for fiscal year 1995 operating payments is higher than the update already legislated
by the Congress. ProPAC used its traditional approach of examining individually the factors that contribute to the
update. The Commission believes this process results in an appropriate percentage to update the standardized payment
amounts for fiscal year 1995.
In addition, the Commission recommends an update factor for the Federal capital payment rate. ProPAC follows an update
framework similar to that used for the operating payment update. For fiscal year 1995, ProPAC recommends a 3.6 percent
increase to the Federal capital payment rate for both urban and rural hospitals. When the transition to fully prospective
capital payments is complete, a single update factor should be used for adjusting PPS operating and capital payment
rates.

The Commission also considers the update for facilities currently excluded from PPS and the update to the composite
payment rate for dialysis services. The facilities excluded from PPS are subject to the payment limitations and incentives
established in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. For fiscal year 1995, ProPAC recommends the target
rates for these facilities should be updated by 2.7 percent. Finally, the Commission recommends that the composite
payment rate for dialysis services should not be increased for fiscal year 1995.



Other Payment Policies

_The Commission is concerned with all factors that might affect Medicare payments to facilities. In Recommendations
15 through 23, ProPAC highlights issues affecting Medicare payment specific to the hospital wage index, the nursing
facility wage index, the outlier payment policy, the indirect medical education (IME) adjustment, and payment policies
for hospital outpatient services.

ProPAC conducted additional analyses related to improving the hospital wage index. It recommends that the wage index
be adjusted to remove the effect of occupational mix. Moreover, the implementation of a new wage index using hospital-specific
labor market areas based on hospital geographic proximity would improve the accuracy of the wage index. The Commission
also reexamined the appropriateness of nursing facility wage index, and recommends collecting data so that such
an index can be developed and used to adjust Medicare skilled nursing facility payments.

ProPAC supports the outlier payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and makes several
additional recommendations to improve the policy for identifying outlier cases and determining outlier payments.
The Commission recommends reducing the IME adjustment to PPS operating payments from 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent and
retaining the IME adjustment until an alternative system for compensating hospital for these costs is adopted.

The Commission submits four recommendations regarding payment for hospital outpatient services. The need for a
prospective payment system is reiterated. Until such a system can be implemented, the current payment formula to
calculate hospital payments for ambulatory surgery center-approved procedures, radiology services, and diagnostic
services should be revised. In addition, beneficiary liability for hospital outpatient services should be reduced.
Finally, the length of hospital outpatient observation stays should be limited.



Recommendations for Fiscal Year 1995



Medicare and Health Care Reform



Recommendation 1: Medicare, Medicaid, and Private Payer Payment and Coverage of the Uninsured



Health care reform will have a major effect on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the care beneficiaries receive.
The Commission believes substantial changes in program policies should be considered only with a health care reform
plan that covers the uninsured and pays comparable rates for similar services. As Medicare and Medicaid have constrained
payments, providers have obtained additional revenue from private payers rather than by reducing their costs. This
increasing reliance on cost shifting concerns ProPAC because it is likely to have a negative effect on access to care
for beneficiaries of government programs. Further, possible adverse effects on beneficiaries of slower growth
in payments for hospital and other currently covered services must be carefully balanced against desirable effects
of increased Medicare spending for new benefits proposed in the Health Security Act.



Recommendation 2: Payments to Hospitals Serving a Large Share of Low-Income Patients



The Health Security Act would substantially reduce Medicare disproportionate share payments, as universal coverage
ameliorates many of the problems these payments are intended to address. The Commission believes the timing of any
such reduction in Medicare payments should be coordinated with the extension of universal coverage, so that hospitals
that provide care to low-income populations are not disadvantaged. As a result, payments would be targeted more effectively
to the hospitals that provide care to these populations. Even so, the payments received by different hospitals and
the balance between payment levels for Medicare and other patients may be affected significantly. These changes
should be structured to ensure that both the level and distribution of payments are appropriate. ProPAC intends to
work with the Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor and study this issue.



Recommendation 3: Payments for Additional Patient Care Costs Incurred by Teaching Hospitals



ProPAC supports the explicit recognition by all payers of the higher patient care costs teaching institutions incur.
The Commission believes such payments should be separated from patient care rates and paid through a fund similar
to the Academic Health Center Account proposed in the Health Security Act. ProPAC is concerned, however, that a sharp
reduction in the payments teaching hospitals receive from government payers may result in financial hardships for
some of the nation's major hospitals. Constraints on payments from private payers may exacerbate this problem. Therefore,
ProPAC recommends that the total level of funding and the formula for distributing payments through such a mechanism
should be based on careful analysis of the costs teaching institutions incur in carrying out their functions and how
these payments will affect graduate medical education and access to the care these facilities provide.



Recommendation 4: Graduate Medical Education Funding and Payment



ProPAC supports efforts to establish a funding mechanism for graduate medical education training programs that
encompasses all payers, including Medicare. The Commission believes this mechanism should be separate from the
payment received for patient care services. The level of funding and the distribution of payments should be determined
according to the following principles:

 Funding for graduate medical education should be consistent with national work force goals, with respect
to both the number of residents trained and their specialty distribution.

 Funding should support training for physician and certain non-physicians medical personnel who contribute
to attaining these goals.

 Payment should be made to the training program, whether it is based in a hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient,
or other ambulatory setting. The optimal method for allocating and distributing such payments needs to be determined.

 Payment for graduate medical education should be based on a national per resident amount, adjusted to recognize
regional differences in residents' salaries and other factors that, upon further study, are found to be appropriate.

In addition, funds should be available to recognize the additional personnel costs of hospitals that operate programs
that lose specialty training positions as a result of the process described above.



Recommendation 5: Quality of Care



The Commission believes there must be an effective quality assurance program for Medicare enrollees, especially
given health reform's emphasis on cost control and proposed cutbacks in Medicare spending. The Peer Review Organization
program should be continued but thoroughly evaluated. It should be replaced only by a program that has been determined
to be more effective.



Recommendation 6: Improvement in Premium Risk Adjustment Methods



The Commission recommends that the Secretary undertake the research necessary to substantially improve current
risk adjustment methods. Risk adjustment will be needed under many health reform proposals to ensure that the premiums
paid to competing health plans accurately reflect the risk composition of their enrollees. Until major improvements
can be made, some other mechanism may be needed to limit the potential impact of enrolling individuals whose care proves
to be exceptionally costly.



Recommendation 7: Controlling Medicare Spending Across All Sites of Care



Medicare should continue to develop policies to monitor and control total expenditure growth across all sites of
care. Payment methods should not unduly favor the choice of one site over another. They should also provide consistent
incentives to constrain increases in volume and service intensity across physicians and other providers. 



Recommendation 8: Strengthening Medicare's Risk Contracting Program



The Commission recommends that the Secretary improve Medicare's risk-based, managed care program to give more Medicare
beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans. To increase plan participation, deficiencies related
to the risk adjustment formula and local differences in payments need to be corrected.



Payment Updates



Recommendation 9: Update Factor for Operating Payments to PPS Hospitals 



For fiscal year 1995, the PPS standardized payment amounts should be updated to account for the following:

 The projected increase in the HCFA PPS market basket index, currently estimated at 3.7 percent; 

 An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets;

 A negative adjustment of 1.1 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket
forecast;

 A positive adjustment of 0.3 percentage points to reflect the cost-increasing effects of scientific and technological
advances;

 A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity improvements; and 

 A net adjustment of zero percentage points for case-mix change.




In addition, a positive adjustment of 3.1 percentage points should be made for hospitals in rural areas to complete
the phaseout of the differential in standardized amounts between rural and other urban hospitals. ProPAC's recommendation
would result in an estimated average update factor of 2.7 percent for fiscal year 1995: an increase of 2.2 percent for
urban hospitals and of 5.3 percent for rural hospitals.



Recommendation 10: Update Factor for Capital Payment to PPS Hospitals 



For fiscal year 1995, the Commission recommends that a formula-based approach be used to update capital payment rates.
The capital update should include the following:

 The projected increase in a capital market basket index that measures one-year changes in a fixed basket of
capital goods hospitals purchase, currently estimated at 3.4 percent; 

 An adjustment of zero percentage points to correct for past forecast errors;

 An adjustment of zero percentage points to reflect changes in financing costs:

 A positive adjustment of 0.9 percentage points for scientific and technological advances;

A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity; and 

 A net adjustment of zero percentage points for case-mix change.




The Commission's recommendation would result in a 3.6 percent increase in the Federal capital payment rate for both
urban and rural hospitals.



Recommendation 11: Single Operating and Capital Update Factor



The Commission recommends that when the transition to fully prospective capital payments is complete, a single update
factor be used for adjusting PPS operating and capital payment rates. Based on ProPAC's recommended updates to the
operating and capital payment rates, the total increase to a fully prospective combined payment rate would be 2.8
percent for fiscal year 1995.



Recommendation 12: Update Factor for Hospitals Paid on the Basis of Hospital-Specific Rates



The Commission believes payments based on hospital-specific base-year costs for sole community hospitals should
be updated by the average update given to all hospitals.



Recommendation 13: Update Factor for PPS-Excluded Hospitals and Distinct-Part Units



For fiscal year 1995, the target rates for PPS-excluded hospitals and distinct-part units should be updated by 2.7
percent. This recommendation accounts for the following:

 The projected increase in the HCFA PPS-excluded hospital market basket, currently estimated at 3.7 percent;


 An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets;

 A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket
forecast; and 

 An adjustment of zero percentage points for scientific and technological advances.



Recommendation 14: Update to the Composite Rate for Dialysis Services 



The fiscal year 1995 update recommendation for the composite rate for dialysis services accounts for the following:

 The projected increase in the market basket for dialysis services in fiscal year 1995, estimated at 4.3 percent;

 A positive adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to reflect the additional costs associated with scientific
and technological advances;

 A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points to encourage productivity improvements; and 

 A negative discretionary adjustment of 4.0 percentage points to reflect the relationship between payments
and estimated fiscal year 1994 costs.




This results in a net update recommendation of zero percent.



Other Payment Policies



Recommendation 15: Improvements in Hospital Wage Data



The Secretary should develop and implement improved methods for collecting data on employee compensation and paid
hours of employment for hospital workers by occupational category. Once these data become available, the Secretary
should implement an adjustment to the hospital wage index under PPS. This adjustment would correct the wage index
for the inappropriate effects of including geographic differences in the mix of occupations employed.



Recommendation 16: Improvements in the PPS Hospital Wage Index



The Secretary should substantially revise the hospital wage index under PPS for fiscal year 1995. The revised wage
index should be calculated using hospital-specific labor market definitions based on hospital geographic proximity
measured by the air-mile distances between nearby hospitals. The Congress should repeal the current statutory provisions
relating to geographic reclassification for the wage index.



Recommendation 17: Nursing Facility Wage Index



The Secretary should collect data on employee compensation and paid hours of employment for employees of nursing
facilities that care for Medicare skilled nursing facility patients. Once these data become available, the Secretary
should develop a nursing facility wage index and use it to adjust Medicare skilled nursing facility payments.



Recommendation 18: Improving Outlier Payment Policy



The Commission believes the outlier payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 will improve
the current policy for identifying outlier cases and determining outlier payments under PPS. However, the following
changes also should be implemented for fiscal year 1995:

 The estimated cost of the case and the outlier payment amount should no longer be adjusted to reflect the hospital's
indirect medical education and disproportionate share status.

 The marginal cost factor for cost outliers should be increased to 80 percent.




These changes would further increase the effectiveness of outlier payment in protecting against the risk of large
losses on some cases. They would also improve the distribution of outlier payments across hospitals, including hospitals
that receive a large number of transfer cases.



Recommendation 19: Level of the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment to PPS Operating Payments



The Commission recommends that the indirect medical education adjustment to PPS operating payments be reduced from
its current level of 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent for fiscal year 1995. This reduction should be implemented with the
anticipated decrease in indirect medical education payments returned to all hospitals through a proportionate
increase in the standardized payment amounts. The Commission also recommends continuation of the indirect medical
education adjustment to PPS payments until an alternative system of compensating appropriately for the higher costs
of patient care in teaching institutions is fully operational.



Recommendation 20: Prospective Payment Method for Outpatient Services



The Commission believes a prospective payment system for outpatient services should be implemented. Outpatient
payment reform should result in consistent policies across all sites and providers. Payment should be based on a prospective
price per unit of service until other methods can be developed that would appropriately control the volume of services.
The payment rate should be adjusted to reflect justifiable cost differences across settings.



Recommendation 21: Revision of the Payment Formula for Outpatient Services



Until prospective payment systems can be implemented for hospital outpatient services, the blend formula used to
calculate hospital payments for ambulatory surgery center-approved procedures, radiology services, and diagnostic
services should be revised. The formula should subtract beneficiary copayment after the total payment has been calculated.
The resulting reduction in Medicare program payments to hospitals should be used to partially offset increases in
program expenditures due to reducing beneficiary liability.



Recommendation 22: Beneficiary Liability for Hospital Outpatient Services



Beneficiary coinsurance for hospital outpatient services should be limited to 20 percent of the Medicare-allowed
payment, as it is in other settings. For services not paid on a prospective basis, beneficiary copayment would need
to be estimated because it is not known at the time of service delivery.



Recommendation 23: Limit the Length of Outpatient Observation Stays



The Commission recommends limiting the length of hospital outpatient observation stays. Further, these changes
should be coordinated with Peer Review Organizations so that appropriate short stay admissions are not denied. ProPAC
supports HCFA's efforts in this regard.

CHAPTER 1

THE FUTURE OF HOSPITALS



Hospitals_the central institutions in the American health care system_have long been the sole source of technology-oriented
acute health care for the most complex cases. But because the capabilities of technology were limited, until the last
20 years or so one hospital was much like another. Each provided its community with essentially the same range of services
and was structured in a similar manner.

This is no longer the case. Changes in medical science and technology and the financing of services have required hospitals
to become very different entities. Today, hospitals offer a rich mix of complex, intensive services to a variety of
patients. Relationships among hospitals, other institutional providers, and payers have become more complex as
well, incorporating jointly produced services and financial risk sharing. The role of physicians in hospitals'
operations has also evolved. Because of the wider range of services, patients, and institutional arrangements,
hospitals are now a much more diverse group of medical care facilities, with as many differences as similarities.

The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC), created in 1983 by the legislation that established the
Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services, advises the Congress and the Secretary
of Health and Human Services on policies affecting payment for Medicare services in hospitals and other institutional
settings. It is thus appropriate that the Commission look at changes that have affected hospitals in recent years
and how hospitals have responded. This chapter does just that, providing a context for the recommendations in Chapter
2 on changes to Medicare payment policy. The chapter concludes by examining what lies ahead for hospitals, as government
and private payers attempt to curb health care spending and as comprehensive health reform is debated by the Congress.

Several major factors have influenced how hospitals have evolved. The continuous introduction of new technological
capabilities has led to increases in the intensity of inpatient services for the acutely ill. These advances have
also allowed services formerly provided only to hospital inpatients to be furnished in ambulatory settings. Consequently,
new providers have entered the health care market, competing with hospitals for clients.

Changes in financing, limitations by insurers on using specific services, and increased competition have contributed
to unprecedented declines in inpatient hospital utilization. In 1992, for instance, there were 5.5 million fewer
hospital admissions than in 1982, despite a 10 percent population increase. The average length of a hospital stay
also fell to 6.4 days from 7.2 days, even though the average case was more complex. Total health care expenditures,
however, have continued to rise at a dramatic rate, consuming 14 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in
1992. As a result, payers have been pressed to reevaluate their cost-based and charge-based payment practices and
to find ways to reduce their financial risk.

Hospitals have responded to the marked declines in inpatient service use and constrained payments from public and
private payers by actively seeking new sources of revenue. They have expanded their capacity to furnish ambulatory
surgery and other outpatient services and developed specialized units to provide inpatient psychiatric, rehabilitation,
and subacute nursing care. In addition, many have begun to offer home health and various community-based services.
Others have concentrated on eliminating unprofitable cost centers or turned to more revenue-enhancing activities.
Some, for instance, have become specialized facilities like psychiatric or rehabilitation hospitals, while in
rural areas, some small hospitals have eliminated inpatient beds and become outpatient centers. Over time, hospitals
have modified their relationships with insurers, other providers, and physicians and have attempted to curb expenses
to strengthen their market position.

The configuration of the hospital represents a complex interaction between financing, organizing, and providing
specific services in a local environment. Recently, for example, insurers and other payers have strengthened efforts
to reduce payments to hospitals and other providers, and implemented utilization control activities. These financial
pressures have forced hospitals to assume more risk than was the case under charge-based or cost-based reimbursement.
Additionally, hospitals have had to take a closer look at whether to add new technologies and services.

Although for the past decade hospitals have been a major target of government cost control_primarily through Medicare
and Medicaid payment policy_spending for the services they provide almost tripled between 1980 and 1991, from $102
billion to $289 billion. Total health care expenditures, however, have risen even more rapidly. Consequently, policy
makers are currently debating how to reform the health care system to rein in the growth of public and private spending,
while also expanding coverage to the nearly 39 million Americans who are uninsured. Even if reform is gradual and not
comprehensive, hospitals will be pressured to reduce costs and generate new revenues by expanding service capacity.
If comprehensive reform is enacted, the fundamental relationships among payers, physicians, and other types of
providers may change markedly. The evolution of individual hospital swill depend heavily on how health reform affects
each facility's local market, patient population, payer mix, and regulatory environment.



Factors Affecting how Hospitals Have Evolved



The health care environment has undergone radical changes over the past two decades and is on the threshold of even
greater ones. Two major forces_advances in medical technology and financing mechanisms_have profoundly influenced
hospitals. Technological innovations have expanded the services hospitals furnish and led to increased competition
from other providers. Until recently, a steady stream of revenues from third-party cost-based and charge-based
payers financed these innovations. Increasingly, as payment policies have changed hospitals have used higher payments
from some payers to cover losses created by lower payments from others. This has allowed the continued expansion of
services even as certain payers have attempted to limit expenditures.



Technological Advances



Recent technological advances affecting the hospital industry range from the development of new pharmaceutical
and surgical instruments to expensive diagnostic equipment like magnetic resonance imaging devices (MRIs).

During the 1970s and early 1980s, hospitals were quick to adopt new technologies even when clinical indications for
their appropriate use were still largely unstudied.1 Computerized tomography (CT) scanners are illustrative.
This technology first appeared in 1973; by 1985, almost all community hospitals with more than 300 beds had a CT unit,
even though purchase prices averaged about $500,000.2 Similarly, in 1981, 14.8 percent of hospitals had cardiac
catheterization capacity; by 1992, this had risen to 27.6 percent (see Table 1-1). Hospitals have also increased
their magnetic resonance imaging, megavolt radiation therapy, and open-heart surgery capabilities since the beginning
of the 1980s.

Because it was so costly, most state-of-the-art equipment traditionally was purchased only by hospitals. But new
technological developments, along with advances in medical expertise, have expanded the ability of outpatient
providers to offer services in competing sites. The number of ambulatory surgery centers, for example, mushroomed
from 239 in 1983 to 1,556 in 1991.3

Technological developments not only have allowed hospitals and other providers to offer a broader array of services,
but also have enabled more people and conditions to be treated. The expanded volume that accompanies both new and existing
technologies contributes more to the rise in health care expenditures than does the cost of the technological devices,
themselves. Consequently, if frequently used, even relatively inexpensive innovations can contribute substantially
to health care spending. As the supply of technology extends beyond hospitals and the demand for these services increases,
utilization may grow more rapidly, thus driving up health care expenditures.

Financing Changes


Advances in technology have raised the cost of medical care because they have permitted the treatment of more complex
cases. As the cost of providing such care exceeded the ability of most individuals to pay, a third party joined the hospital-patient
relationship. This third party initially was a private insurance plan that helped individuals share the risk of costly
illness. In 1965, the government joined the payer mix with the creation of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For
many years, government and private payers collected funds and distributed payments to hospitals for the care of their
beneficiaries, but did not become involved in decisions relating to the services that were provided, the site of care,
or the type of provider. Payments to providers were made on the basis of costs or charges, which allowed revenues to
increase directly as costs rose.
But with health care expenditures accelerating much more rapidly than general inflation, insurance premiums grew
markedly. This not only threatened the ability and willingness of employers to fund higher premiums, but also affected
individuals by driving up out-of-pocket payments for many services. Third-party payers responded by seeking ways
to slow the growth_particularly that in hospitals because they had high costs per case and accounted for a major share
of total health care spending. Responding to skyrocketing government payments. Medicare in the early 1980s replaced
cost-based hospital payment with the prospective payment system. This system allowed Medicare to reduce the growth
of its hospital payments. While some private insurers were also able to control payment growth, most were not.
Hospitals have attempted to generate revenue to cover losses from uncompensated care and below-cost payments for
Medicaid and Medicare patients by raising charges to private insurers. This practice is called ``cost shifting.''
In addition, hospitals have actively sought other sources of revenue. In 1981 net revenue gains from private insurers
equaled 5.0 percent of total hospital costs, while in 1991 this figure had risen to 11.6 percent (see Table 1-2).
This largely offset losses from Medicare, which increased from 1.0 percent to 4.4 percent, and from Medicaid, which
rose from 0.7 percent to 2.3 percent of total costs. Depending on their payer mix, however, hospitals differ in their
ability to cost shift. Those with large uncompensated care patient populations and few generously paying privately
insured patients, for example, have had limited ability to cost shift. By contrast, other types of hospitals_particularly
those with a large proportion of privately insured patients_have found it easier to cost shift.

The array of providers and payers and the lack of adequate coordination among them also encourages shifts in site of
care by driving up use and expanding capacity in those settings that are not experiencing as much pressure to contain
costs. For example while prospective payments has slowed the growth of Medicare payments for inpatient care, service
utilization in post-acute and ambulatory settings has exploded, with a corresponding increase in expenditures.

Questioning the medical appropriateness and need for many hospital admissions, third-party payers have adopted
policies to encourage the use of less costly providers and settings. Many private insurers have turned to managed
care arrangements, using financial incentives, preferred provider agreements, and increased utilization review
to curb the use of inpatient hospital care. Private payers are also increasingly regulating and limiting what they
will cover and how much they will reimburse, giving hospitals incentives to change the mix of services they provide.
Government, on the other hand, has focused its efforts on evaluating, through utilization review, whether specific
services should be furnished and determining the setting in which services must be provided. Medicare, for example,
requires performance of almost all cataract surgery on an outpatient basis. Both public and private payers have attempted
to influence the site and provision of services through preadmission certification and retrospective claims review
with possible denial of payment.



Legal and Regulatory Environments



The legal and regulatory environments that hospitals face at both the Federal and state levels also affect their financial
condition and organization of service delivery. The Federal government influences hospitals, for example, through
antitrust and tax laws. These regulations significantly affect hospitals' ability to respond to financial pressures
by acquiring or contracting with other health care providers.

Many states are considering or in the process of enacting comprehensive health reform legislation that will influence
how hospitals are paid and which services are provided, even in the absence of Federal health reform.4 Several states_among
them Vermont, North Dakota, Florida, and Minnesota_are crafting cost-containment strategies that include expenditure
targets or global caps on health care spending and encourage or mandate the development of managed care networks.
Minnesota has established state boards to oversee major capital expenditures and to foster collaboration among
providers. Vermont is preparing to implement payment limits for all providers within the state, while providing
health insurance to all its residents. Hawaii has had universal health insurance coverage for 20 years. If states
successfully lower the rates of increase in health care expenditures, hospitals will see their revenues constrained
and their ability to cost shift among payers limited.


Hospital Responses to Changes in the Health Care Environment



How an individual hospital has evolved in response to technological advances, financing changes, and legal or regulatory
developments has depended on the hospital's internal and external environments. Among their responses are changes
in the services provided; attempts to control cost growth; and innovative arrangements among hospitals, other providers,
and insurers. The end result has been significant diversification in the hospital industry.



Services Provided



A combination of fewer admissions and shorter stays has encouraged hospitals to seek alternative sources of revenue.
Inpatient admissions for the population 65 and over decreased with the implementation of PPS in 1983, but began growing
again in 1986. Among the nonelderly, both the number and rate of inpatient admissions have continued to drop. Average
length of stay fell considerably after PPS was introduced and has shown only modest changes since then.

Some hospitals have responded to the decline in acute patient admissions by targeting different patient populations.
If hospitals convert to specialty status, they also may be shielded from stringent cost containment. In particular,
they are exempt from PPS. Since 1980, the number of general medical and surgical hospitals has decreased by 11.2 percent,
while the number of psychiatric hospitals has accelerated by 41.8 percent and the number of other specialty hospitals
has grown by 7.3 percent (see Table 1-3).

The significance of non-inpatient and skilled nursing services also has increased, although it varies by hospital
location (see Table 1-4). In 1985 about 40 percent of rural community hospitals reported having any organized
outpatient service; by 1992, more than 84 percent had this capability. While 17 percent of rural hospitals surveyed
derived more than half of net patient care revenues in 1993 from ambulatory services, this was true for only about 6
percent of urban hospitals (see Table 1-5). These revenues were also a larger share of net patient care revenues
for non-teaching than for teaching hospitals.

Skilled nursing services were provided by 34 percent of community hospitals in 1992, compared with 18.8 percent in
1985. Further, a significantly higher proportion of rural, compared with urban, hospitals furnished this care.
This may partly reflect the attempts of rural institutions to compensate for reduced inpatient utilization by expanding
skilled nursing care capacity. The percentage of rural hospitals with swing beds (beds certified by Medicare as either
acute care or skilled nursing beds) has also risen.

Hospitals have increasingly added home care capacity as well. Hospital home care visits doubled between 1980 and
1990, from 6.2 million to 12.3 million.5 Compared with smaller hospitals, larger ones had more visits.6 The percentage
of community hospitals operating home care programs, however, is not growing as rapidly as the use of home care services.

During the 1970s and 1980s, many hospitals expanded their outpatient departments and added ambulatory surgery centers.
On average, 37 percent of hospital equipment is devoted to meeting outpatient demand.7 This expansion has had a major
impact on hospital revenues. About 25 percent of hospital revenues, on average, now come from out-patient services
(see Table 1-6). While inpatient admissions have declined by about 14 percent since 1980, nonemergency outpatient
visits have more than doubled (see Table 1-7). Similarly, more than half of hospital surgical procedures in
1992 were performed on an outpatient basis, compared with only 16.3 percent in 1980.

Along with expanding their service capacity, hospitals have also increased their labor pool to administer the new
services. The number of full-time equivalent personnel (FTEs) per patient has grown steadily since the 1970s (see
Table 1-8). In part this reflects the surge in outpatient hospital services, since FTEs employed by hospitals
may work in either inpatient or outpatient departments. Nonetheless, labor costs as a percentage of total hospital
costs have been decreasing, while capital costs are increasing as a percentage of total costs.



Attempts to Control Growth in Costs



Financial pressures on hospitals have spurred the growth in services to augment revenues and have fostered a greater
reliance on cost shifting. As a result of these efforts, in aggregate, hospitals have maintained positive total revenue
margins. In 1991, the total margin was 4.3 percent_higher than at any time before the introduction of PPS.

However, as government and private insurers have stepped-up their cost-containment efforts, hospitals are less
able to compensate for losses. Therefore, hospitals must increase efforts to reduce costs and indeed have done so.
After peaking at 5.0 percent in 1992, annual real growth (above general inflation) in hospital costs per case dropped
to 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 1993 and to 1.0 percent in the third quarter. Whether this is a one-time phenomenon
or the beginning of a trend is uncertain.






Arrangements With Other Hospitals, Facilities, and Insurers



Hospitals have adopted a number of organizational strategies to respond to changes in their operating environment.
They have, for instance, merged with, acquired, or contracted with other hospitals and providers. They have also
developed more complex relationships with insurers.

During the 1980s, hospitals tended to diversify by acquiring facilities or businesses (such as parking lots or non-health
care businesses) that often were unrelated to their basic mission. Many of these investments were unprofitable,
partly because hospital administrators lacked the skills to manage non-acute care ventures.8 In the 1990s, however,
hospital diversification efforts have focused on reducing costs and offering a wider range of services to large employers
and purchasing coalitions through managed care contracts.9

Extensive mergers and acquisitions during the 1980s led to the growth in the number of multihospital systems and in
the percentage of institutions that belonged to these systems (see Table 1-9). Between 1979 and 1992, the proportion
of hospitals that were members of multihospital systems increased from 27.1 percent to 43.2 percent. These systems
were thought to produce economies of scale and scope, but whether they are more efficient is debatable.10 The fact
that the number of formal multihospital systems actually declined between 1990 and 1992 may reflect a trend toward
the use of less formal contractual arrangements, as well as mergers of existing systems.

Hospitals have also developed innovative contractual arrangements with other providers. Some rural hospitals,
for example, have dealt with declining population bases and the inability to provide high-technology services to
the communities they serve by setting up rural networks or establishing telemedicine or computer information linkages
with large urban hospitals and other providers. Such linkages have changed the configuration of the rural hospital.

Financial pressures have also stimulated the growth of managed care, which has substantially altered the nature
of relationships between hospitals and insurers. For example, hospitals may assume more financial risk under a capitated
payment system. Types of managed care arrangements differ substantially, however; the degree of control over physician
and other providers decision making_and this utilization_consequently differs. Health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) in particular attempt to control expenditures primarily by reducing the use of inpatient hospital care. Staff
and group model HMOs exercise more control over their employees than do independent practice associations or preferred
provider organizations (PPOs).

The growth in the managed care industry has been well-documented, although the rate of growth has not been uniform
throughout the country.11 In the West Census region in 1992, for instance, 25 percent of the population was enrolled
in some sort of HMO, compared with 7.8 percent in the South. The implementation of managed care plans has also differed
throughout the country. The average managed care plan in the Pacific Census division contracts with 60 hospitals,
while that in New England contracts with 22 hospitals.


As managed care market power has grown, more hospitals have begun contracting with HMOs and PPOs (see Table 1-10).
This trend is reflected in the increased importance of managed care as a source of revenue. In 1993, 15.6 percent of
hospitals in the Far West and 7.2 percent of hospitals in the East Central part of the country reported that more than
25 percent of their net patient care revenues came from HMOs or PPOs (see Table 1-11). Urban hospitals received
more, on average, from HMOs and PPOs than did rural hospitals, although 13.6 percent of rural hospitals reported receiving
more than 10 percent of revenues from these sources.



Arrangements With Physicians



While hospitals provide the buildings, equipment, and staff necessary to furnish complex inpatient (and other)
services, they cannot operate without the cooperation of physicians, who admit, treat, and discharge patients.
Evidence suggests that a large portion of total health care expenditures (an estimated 50 percent to 80 percent or
more) are directly influenced_if not directly controlled_by physicians.12 In addition, physicians may influence
hospitals' nonoperating expenditures by advocating particular types of capital investments.

As hospitals have assumed more financial risk, they have increasingly pressured physicians to control their costs
and use of hospital services through internal management strategies and contractual relationships that call for
shared financial risk with doctors. How well hospitals and physicians work together to control costs and improve
quality is unclear. Reluctant to surrender their autonomy, physicians have largely been able to resist hospitals'
efforts to modify their practice styles. Therefore, many hospital administrators concentrated more on maximizing
revenues during the 1980s than on engaging physicians as partners in helping them curtail spending. This strategy
seems to be changing in the 1990s as hospitals and physicians increasingly recognize their interrelated roles and
responsibilities.

The ability of hospitals and physicians to set up joint financial arrangements_in particular to contract with managed
care organizations_has affected the way some hospitals deal with doctors. One recent trend is for hospitals to acquire
physician practices and try to integrate physicians into hospital management to some degree. In 1993, almost 14 percent
of hospitals surveyed had a formal physician/hospital organization (PHO), 7 percent had a management services organization
(MSO), and 4 percent had a foundation that negotiated managed care contracts on behalf of the hospital and physicians
as a unit (see Table 1-12).13 Such practice arrangements are less popular in the West Central region than in other
parts of the country, and are more common in urban and teaching hospitals. These arrangements, however, are not unheard
of in rural hospitals, where 14 percent of hospitals surveyed reported having some type of joint venture with physicians.

Hospitals in the Future



The health care reform debate now under way focuses on the need for and types of reforms necessary to stem runaway health
spending and provide universal health insurance coverage. The uncertain outcome of this debate could have a dramatic
effect on the hospital of the future. Already, hospitals have responded in a variety of ways to the pressures they face,
diversifying the services they offer, pursuing different avenues to control costs, and adopting new strategies
that govern their relationships with other providers and physicians. Existing pressures to reduce spending and
adapt to changing medical practices will continue. Federal, state, and local governments will further their efforts
to bring health care expenditures under control and extend services to vulnerable populations. Private payers will
exert similar pressures. Medical practice will advance, adding new treatments and expanding the populations that
could benefit from medical services.


The anticipation of health care reform and its ultimate nature, though, will further affect hospitals and their role
in health care delivery. Comprehensive reform that alters the structure of financing and delivery systems to control
expenditure growth and expand coverage would bring the most dramatic changes. Incremental reforms that modify the
existing relationships among payers and providers would likely continue the adaptations hospitals are making now.
Regardless of the shape of reform, the critical features that will affect hospitals relate to the type, strength,
and source of pressure to control spending.


Health care expenditure control can be achieved through slowing the growth in costs per unit of service, reducing
the number and intensity of services provided, managing the mix of services, or all three. Hospitals will be affected
differently, depending on which strategy is followed and the strength of the pressure to respond. Likewise, the source
of the pressure to control expenditures will affect hospital responses. The impact of the efforts of individual payers_either
in the government or private sector_would be quite different from a government mandate for expenditure control applied
to all payers. Similarly, whether hospitals are singled out or all health care facilities are subject to controls
will affect the response.

<TEXT>
 






Rate-setting approaches to expenditure control involve imposing a payment per unit of service. These rates could
be used by all or some payers and could be applied to a range of services and providers. Rate setting would force institutions
to gain control over the cost of producing individual services by improving production efficiency. If rates were
imposed only for some services or provider types, or only by some payers, shifts among types of services and across
settings would continue as a way to avoid cost-containment pressure. Hospitals may also respond to these efforts
by focusing on providing those services that are relatively better paid. This could put some services or populations
at risk.

A system of global budgets or insurance premium caps could accelerate the movement of hospitals to gain control over
the continuum of care. Global budgets are expenditure limits or targets that could be applied to types of providers
or services. Premium caps are similar limits that would be enforced by insurers. Hospitals may respond by forming
health care networks to control expenditures for an episode of care. Alternatively, hospitals may concentrate on
providing a narrow range of services efficiently and marketing these to established networks or payers. Hospitals
that fail to coordinate their services with those offered by other providers would be the most vulnerable under this
scenario. Unless quality of care is carefully considered, however, needed services could be eliminated in order
to stay within the limits.

Under any type of reform, less stringent cost-control efforts would not be as disruptive to health care delivery patterns.
Besides having a greater impact on spending growth, intense expenditure control efforts would likely alter institutional
arrangements and service delivery patterns.

The sources of pressure to control expenditures may also affect the outcome of reform initiatives, as demonstrated
by the responses to the implementation of PPS. Cost shifting from less generous payers (including most public ones)
to more generous (largely private) payers has had two major results. First, the gains from private-pay patients have
enabled the hospital sector to alleviate the pressure to control costs that public programs have attempted to create.
Second, the ability to cost shift has, for many patients, maintained access to services they overwise might not have
received.

Cost-containment pressure in any form that is applied by some payers but not by others would exacerbate the current
disparity in relative payment levels across payers. This would put certain hospitals at a financial disadvantage
because of their inability to compete for patients with more generous private insurance coverage. Increasingly,
a hospital's financial condition would be determined by its payer mix rather than its efficiency. If the gap in relative
payment levels is widened because of different cost-containment measures across payers, many hospitals that provide
important services to specific segments of the population may curtail their operations.
Within this climate of health reform to control expenditures and expand coverage, medical technology continues
to evolve. New threats to the public's health (such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and medical advances
in areas like biotechnology and diagnostic imaging will lead to the ongoing development of expensive new drugs, equipment,
and procedures. Better understanding of disease processes and medical techniques for combating illness will continue.
This will add to the momentum to modify the mix of services and site of delivery. Such changes may enhance the hospital's
role, if it has control over the continuum of service delivery. To the extent that these changes allow more providers
to compete with the hospital or substitute for some of its functions, its role could diminish.
It is unclear how health care reform will affect the development and diffusion of new technology and the application
of medical advances. Cost control may concentrate on innovations that reduce the cost of care. Reform that incorporates
rate setting would be more likely to promote innovations that lower the cost of providing services. Global budget
or premium cap reform approaches would focus attention on technologies or procedures that diminish costs over an
episode of care. Under any reform scenario, public and private payers will continue their efforts to curb spending
associated with new or diffusing technologies and the expanded ability to provide services.
The hospital's traditional role as the center of the health care delivery system has changed dramatically and is continuing
to evolve. Hospital spending still makes up the largest part of total health expenditures, despite the increasing
availability of services outside the inpatient setting and the proliferation of ambulatory care providers. As a
result, hospitals will bear much of the pressure to alter the way health care is delivered and paid for in the future.
How much of this pressure falls on different hospitals will vary, depending on each hospital's current situation.
how each hospital chooses to respond, and how well the hospital can implement its response, will differ as well. What
the future holds for each hospital therefore will be determined by a mix of internal and external forces. Facilities
thus will be further differentiated in the services they provide and their relationships with other components of
the health care financing and delivery system.

Chapter 2
RECOMMENDATIONS



When the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) was created by the Congress in 1983, its primary responsibility
was to examine issues related to the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) and make recommendations for updating
and improving it. The Congress gradually has expanded ProPAC's mandate to include payment policies for all facility
services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Commission has conducted analyses of Medicare
payments for skilled nursing facility (SNF), home health agency, and endstage renal disease (ESRD) dialysis facility
services.

In addition, at the request of the Congress, the Commission has examined the adequacy of Medicaid hospital payment
rates and the use of Medicare payment methods for other payers. It has also analyzed issues related to the design and
implementation of a global budgeting system to restrain health care spending. ProPAC continues to devote substantial
effort, however, to updating and improving payment for hospitals under PPS and for those hospitals and distinct-part
units excluded from PPS.

Although this report is submitted to the Congress, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider
ProPAC's recommendations and respond to them in the annual notice of PPS rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

. The Commission is always pleased to work with the Secretary to provide additional analysis and information on its
recommendations.

ProPAC's recommendations reflect the collective judgment of the 17 Commissioners. By the nature of their subject,
some recommendations are reviewed each year, such as the annual update factors. Others address new issues or modify
previous recommendations. All incorporate recent research findings. For fiscal year 1995, the Commission's recommendations
address broader issues related to Medicare and health care reform, in addition to the recommendations that relate
more specifically to Medicare facility payments.



Recommendations for Fiscal Year 1995



The Commission's recommendations center on three areas of concern:

 Medicare and health care reform, 
 Payment updates, and
 Other payment policies.


ProPAC's recommendations are intended to improve the equity and effectiveness of Medicare's payments for health
care services. In this report, the Commission has considered certain aspects of health care reform that may affect
the Medicare program. The recommendations that address payment updates reflect the Commission's view on aggregate
spending levels. Finally, other recommendations concern the distribution of Medicare payments or the equity of
Medicare's payment formulas.



Medicare and Health Care Reform



The health care industry is facing major challenges this year as legislators and policy makers struggle to control
health expenditures and expand coverage to people without insurance. Several legislative proposals have been introduced
to reform the health care system. Some of these focus on incremental changes that would affect the financing and delivery
of health care. Others call for fundamental restructuring of the existing systems. Most include provisions affecting
the Medicare program.

The Health Security Act introduced by the President would fundamentally change the financing and delivery of health
care. Under this proposal, most people under 65 would obtain health insurance coverage through regional or corporate
alliances. These alliances would negotiate with health plans to provide medical services. The health plans would
compete for patients on the basis of quality and costs. This managed competition among plans is expected to control
the growth in health expenditures. As a contingency, however, premium rate increases would be limited if expenditure
growth were not contained.

Medicare would be retained as a separate program under the President's proposal, although it would be subject to a
number of cost-saving measures. Reductions in hospital payment updates are proposed. The disproportionate share
(DSH) adjustment would be substantially reduced; however, universal coverage may ameliorate many of the problems
this adjustment is intended to address. Medicare's indirect medical education (IME) adjustment would be replaced
by an Academic Health Center Account to which Medicare and the alliances would contribute. Medicare's direct medical
education payments for the cost of training medical residents would also be replaced by a special account funded by
all payers. Although the Act incorporates mechanisms to ensure the quality of health care provided to those enrolled
through the alliances, the oversight provided by Medicare's Peer Review Organizations (PROs) would be discontinued.

The Commission believes health care reform would have a major impact on both providers and beneficiaries. The first
eight recommendations for fiscal year 1995 reflect the Commission's concerns regarding the effect of health care
reform on the Medicare program, providers, and beneficiaries.



Recommendation 1: Medicare, Medicaid, and Private Payer Payment and Coverage of the Uninsured



Health care reform will have a major effect on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the care beneficiaries receive.
The Commission believes substantial changes in program policies should be considered only with a health care reform
plan that covers the uninsured and pays comparable rates for similar services. As Medicare and Medicaid have constrained
payments, providers have obtained additional revenue from private payers rather than by reducing their costs. This
increasing reliance on cost shifting concerns ProPAC because it is likely to have a negative effect on access to care
for beneficiaries of government programs. Further, possible adverse effects on beneficiaries of slower growth
in payments for hospital and other currently covered services must be carefully balanced against desirable effects
of increased Medicare spending for new benefits proposed in the Health Security Act.

The Health Security Act proposed by the President contains a number of complex features that interact and could have
a major effect on the services Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries receive. The Act would slow the growth in Medicare
and Medicaid spending for currently covered services, create a new prescription drug benefit, and add coverage for
long-term care services for the disabled. It would also use premium limits to curb the rise in private payer spending
and extend coverage to the uninsured.

Medicare and, more recently, Medicaid have been important sources of additional revenues for hospitals that treat
a disproportionate share of the poor. Substantial reductions in payment levels, such as those proposed in the Health
Security Act, could adversely affect access to care for beneficiaries in both programs. Such reductions should be
considered only insofar as health reform provides coverage for the uninsured.

Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary access to quality care also depends on whether providers receive appropriate
payments from both government programs and private payers. Proposals that would further restrain spending by public
payers but that fail to narrow the gap in payment to cost ratios between public and private payers or to provide coverage
for the uninsured could make it more difficult for the beneficiaries of public programs and the uninsured to obtain
access to necessary care.

As both Medicare and Medicaid have constrained payments in recent years, hospitals have turned to private payers
for additional revenue to offset losses, rather than reducing the increase in their expenses. Cost shifting has allowed
the Medicare program to curb spending, while permitting beneficiaries to receive services at costs that exceeded
payments. It has also enabled many hospitals to maintain their financial position. The ability of hospitals to cost
shift, however, has reduced their financial incentive to control expenses and increased the costs for subscribers
of private insurance plans. The reliance on cost shifting as a revenue source has also disadvantaged hospitals that
provide services to a large share of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and charity care patients.Further, cost
shifting has disadvantaged hospitals where private payers successfully control hospital revenues. Consequently,
hospital financial condition and the availability of services increasingly are determined by payer mix rather than
by efficiency.

A health care reform plan like the Health Security Act, which would constrain the growth in private payer as well as
government spending, could also affect the care received by Medicare beneficiaries. Since hospitals would not be
able to obtain additional revenue from private payers, they would have to limit expenses to a level consistent with
revenues. The slower rise in payments for current Medicare services, however, would be accompanied by increased
spending for a new prescription drug benefit and coverage of certain long-term care services. As the reform debate
continues, balancing the effects of a slowdown in spending for hospital and other covered services with an increase
in expenditures for new benefits is necessary to avoid untoward effects on Medicare beneficiaries.

Recommendation 2: Payments to Hospitals Serving a Large Share of Low-Income Patients


The Health Security Act would substantially reduce Medicare disproportionate share payments, as universal coverage
ameliorates many of the problems these payments are intended to address. The Commission believes the timing of any
such reduction in Medicare payments should be coordinated with the extension of universal coverage, so that hospitals
that provide care to low-income populations are not disadvantaged. As a result, payments would be targeted more effectively
to the hospitals that provide care to these populations. Even so, the payments received by different hospitals and
the balance between payment levels for Medicare and other patients may be affected significantly. These changes
should be structured to ensure that both the level and distribution of payments are appropriate. ProPAC intends to
work with the Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to monitor and study this issue.
The Medicare DSH adjustment was implemented in 1986 to provide additional payments to PPS hospitals that treat a large
share of indigent patients. Since then, the amount of DSH payments has grown rapidly, as Congress has increased the
number of eligible hospitals and raised the adjustment for many. From fiscal year 1989 to fiscal year 1993, Medicare
operating DSH payments grew from $1.1 billion (2.4 percent of all PPS payments) to $2.7 billion (4.1 percent of PPS
payments). In addition, beginning in fiscal year 1992, hospitals received a DSH adjustment to their prospective
capital payment amount.
Analyses by the Congressional Budget Office, ProPAC, and others have shown that Medicare DSH payments far exceed
any additional costs that might be associated with treating Medicare patients in disproportionate share hospitals.
As a result, in the eighth year of PPS, the PPS margin for all disproportionate share hospitals was 1.6 percent, compared
with ^7.2 percent for other hospitals.
The bulk of Medicare DSH payments goes to hospitals that provide a large amount of uncompensated care and other services
to the poor. This is often cited as a justification for the magnitude of the payments made under the Medicare DSH provision
and the rules that govern how these payments are distributed. Disproportionate share hospitals_particularly those
in inner cities_tend to have lower total margins than other hospitals. The Commission is concerned about whether,
without Medicare DSH payments, Medicare beneficiaries and other populations would continue to have access to the
services these hospitals provide.
However, ProPAC also is concerned about the ability to target Medicare DSH payments effectively to the hospital that
need them most. Of all PPS hospitals, the 10 percent with the greatest uncompensated care losses relative to their
total costs provided 28 percent of all uncompensated care (net of government subsidies); these hospitals received
only 17 percent of all Medicare DSH payments. At the other end of the spectrum, the 10 percent of PPS hospitals with the
smallest uncompensated care burdens provided almost no net uncompensated are, yet received almost 9 percent of all
Medicare DSH payments.
The Health Security Act eventually would eliminate almost all Medicare DSH payments, lowering Medicare hospital
payments by an estimated $430 million in fiscal year 1996. Medicare DSH payments would be $4.8 billion lower than currently
projected by fiscal year 2000, amounting to a 3.5 percent reduction in baseline Medicare payments. On the other hand,
people who are now uninsured and those who are underinsured would begin to receive coverage. Consequently, hospitals
now uncompensated for providing care to these patients would be paid for these services.
Hospitals that serve low-income populations would still face some risk of financial losses, particularly in treating
some noncitizens and other individuals who may be unable to meet their financial obligations to providers. To recognize
the additional costs of treating low-income patients and to help hospitals furnish inpatient services to poor populations
not covered by the standard benefit package, $800 million would be available in each of the first five years following
passage of the Act. These funds would be distributed based on the share of total inpatient days accounted for by low-income
patients at each eligible hospital.
As with many provisions of the Health Security Act, the impact of the reduction in Medicare DSH payments and the extent
to which it is offset by universal coverage is difficult to estimate. In addition to the level of total hospital payments,
the distribution of payments also may change significantly. The Commission is concerned by the magnitude of these
changes and their potential effects on the availability of necessary services to Medicare beneficiaries and all
Americans. In addition, if the timing of the reduction of DSH payments is not coordinated with the extension of universal
coverage, hospitals that provide care to low-income populations may be adversely affected.
Preliminary analysis indicates that the financial status of hospitals in the aggregate will depend largely on their
ability to hold cost increases below historical rates. ProPAC will continue to examine the implications of health
care reform for the distribution of payments. In addition, the technical appropriateness of the proposed changes
in the rules that determine Medicate DSH payments will be investigated as part of the Commission's ongoing mandate
to analyze, develop, and recommend improvements in Medicare payment for facility-based services.


Recommendation 3: Payments for Additional Patient Care Costs Incurred by Teaching Hospitals


ProPAC supports the explicit recognition by all payers of the higher patient care costs teaching institutions incur.
The Commission believes such payments should be separated from patient are rates and paid through a fund similar to
the Academic Health Center Account proposed in the Health Security Act. ProPAC is concerned, however, that a sharp
reduction in the payments teaching hospitals receive from government payers may result in financial hardships for
some of the nation's major hospitals. Constraints on payments from private payers may exacerbate this problem. Therefore,
ProPAC recommends that the total level of funding and the formula for distributing payments through such a mechanism
should be based on careful analysis of the costs teaching institutions incur in carrying out their functions and how
these payments will affect graduate medical education and access to the care these facilities provide.
The Health Security Act proposes an Academic Health Center Account to support the patient are costs incurred routinely
by teaching facilities but not by other institutions. Among these are the costs of reduced faculty productivity,
uncompensated costs of clinical research, and higher costs associated with specialized treatment of exceptional
cases. Contributions from Medicare and from the regional and corporate alliances would fund the account. The available
funds would be distributed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services on the basis of a formula related to the proposed
Medicare IME adjustment percentage for fiscal year 1996. Thus, payments for the additional patient care costs insured
by teaching hospitals would be separated from payments for patient care services.

<TEXT>
 

Medicare's contributions to the Academic Health Center Account would be less than the IME payments made under the
current formula, with estimated budget savings of $17.8 billion over five years (1996 to 2000). This proposed reduction
in Medicare payments reflects the Administration's estimate of the amount by which current IME payments exceed the
additional patient care costs attributable to teaching activities.

Set at $2.1 billion in fiscal year 1996 and $2.0 billion in fiscal years 1997 and 1998, Medicare's contributions thereafter
would rise at the same rate as the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers. The total size of the Academic
Health Center Account, including contributions from the regional and corporate alliances as well as Medicare, would
be $3.1 billion in fiscal year 1996, increasing to $3.2 billion, $3.2 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.8 billion in the
succeeding years.

Many private payers now pay higher rates to teaching hospitals for patient care services. However, in an environment
of heightened price competition, teaching hospitals may not be able to obtain payments that reflect their higher
patient care costs. Thus, they will likely be unable to fund these with revenue from patient care services.

The Commission supports the explicit recognition by all payers of the higher costs of treating patients in teaching
institutions and the separation of payments for these costs from the basic price of care. However, ProPAC has three
concerns about the Academic Health Center Account proposal in the Health Security Act. First, the amount to be distributed
through the account should adequately reflect the additional costs teaching institutions face. Relatively little
is known about the overall costs associated with the activities that the Academic Health Center Account is intended
to support. Both ProPAC and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have analyzed the relationship between
the intensity of hospital-based teaching activities and the cost of treating Medicare inpatients. However, the
relationship between teaching intensity and the cost of treating other types of patients_that is, Medicare outpatients
and non-Medicare inpatients and outpatients_in hospitals and non-hospital settings is not known. Moreover, existing
information may not be applicable in the environment of tight general funding constraints under health care reform.
More analysis is needed to ensure that the account has sufficient funds to accomplish its purpose.

Second, the distribution of monies from the Academic Health Center Account should be equitable and encourage the
efficient operation of teaching institutions. The proposed application of the Medicare IME adjustment to total
patient care revenue may not be the most appropriate way to accomplish this objective. To allow for the proper distribution
of available funds, further analysis should focus on what factors determine differences across institutions in
terms of the costs these funds are intended to defray.

Finally, the Commission is concerned about how the funding of the academic health center mechanism might affect access
to services these facilities provide for Medicare beneficiaries and others. The funds available through the Academic
Health Center Account must adequately reflect the additional costs of the services they are intended to support.
Substantial reductions in the level of Medicare IME payments should not be made until other components of health reform
are fully implemented. (See Recommendation 19). The impact of any changes in the level or distribution of payments
among hospitals should be monitored carefully.

In addition, distributing Medicare IME payments through the academic health center mechanism rather than as an adjustment
to the Medicare payment rate would mean that the payment received for each Medicare patient would be reduced relative
to its current level (which includes the 7.7 percent IME payment adjustment). Medicare payments are a smaller proportion
of costs than private payer payments. Although ProPAC's preliminary analysis indicates that the current gap between
Medicare and non-Medicare payments relative to costs would narrow rather than widen under the proposed approach,
this issue should be examined closely as health care reform is implemented.



Recommendation 4: Graduate Medical Education Funding and Payment



ProPAC supports efforts to establish a funding mechanism for graduate medical education training programs that
encompasses all payers, including Medicare. The Commission believes this mechanism should be separate from the
payment received for patient care services. The level of funding and the distribution of payments should be determined
according to the following principles:

 Funding for graduate medical education should be consistent with national work force goals, with respect
to both the number of residents trained and their specialty distribution.

 Funding should support training for physicians and certain non-physician medical personnel who contribute
to attaining these goals.

 Payment should be made to the training program, whether it is based in a hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient,
or other ambulatory setting. The optimal method for allocating and distributing such payments needs to be determined.

 Payment for graduate medical education should be based on a national per resident amount, adjusted to recognize
regional differences in residents' salaries and other factors that, upon further study, are found to be appropriate.

In addition, funds should be available to recognize the additional personnel costs of hospitals that operate programs
that lose specialty training positions as a result of the process described above.

The Medicare program historically has paid hospitals for the costs associated with operating a residency training
program. Costs for residents' salaries, faculty supervision, classroom space, program administration, and other
related overhead were, until recently, recognized as a separate expense of which Medicare paid its share. Medicare
is essentially the only payer that explicitly recognizes these expenses. Private insurers pay for these costs implicitly
through the higher payments they make to teaching hospitals.

The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 changed Medicare's payment for these expenses to a hospital-specific
per resident amount. This amount is equal to the hospital's audited per resident costs for the cost reporting period
beginning during fiscal year 1984, updated annually by the increase in the CPI for all urban consumers.

Under the Health Security Act, there would be a fundamental change in financing for graduate medical education (GME).
Both Medicare and the health care alliances (the entities responsible for coordinating the purchase of health insurance
for the non-Medicare population) would contribute directly to a Health Professions Workforce Account. Initial
funding for this account would be set at $3.2 billion in fiscal year 1996, rising to $5.8 billion in 1999 and 2000 and
increasing at the same rate as the gross domestic product thereafter.

The Act would establish, within the Department of Health and Human Services, a new National Council on Graduate Medical
Education. This council would determine the number and specialty distribution of residency positions to be funded.
At least 55 percent of individuals completing eligible programs nationwide would be required to be in primary care,
beginning with the class entering training in the 1998-1999 academic year. The primary care specialties to
which the act refers are family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology.

Funds would be distributed to the individual residency programs, rather than to the hospital. Each program would
receive a per resident payment amount based on the national average per resident cost in the 1992-1993 academic
year, trended forward by the CPI and adjusted to reflect regional differences in residents' wages and wage-related
costs.

The Act would also establish a program with respect to graduate nurse training that parallels the one for physician
training, with funding set at $200 million annually. The Secretary of Health and Human Services would be further required
to establish or expand programs to train physicians, nurses, physician assistants, and other health professionals
to improve the efficiency and availability of health care across geographic locations and settings.

ProPAC agrees that changes are needed in the way that graduate medical education and other health care training activities
are structured and financed. While others have devoted substantial attention to issues related to the supply and
distribution of health care personnel, the Commission's focus is on payment policies, particularly as they affect
facility-based care provided to the Medicare population and other groups. Consistent with this focus, ProPAC has
identified several principles that should be used in determining the level of funding and the distribution of payments
to support the training of health care professionals. These principles should be used to guide policies relating
to the funding of graduate medical education whether comprehensive health reform is enacted or not.



All-Payer Funding Mechanism._

The Commission believes it is appropriate to include all payers in a mechanism for funding graduate medical education
that sets a nationwide level for such funding. Moreover, this mechanism should be separate from the payment received
for patient care services.

Currently, payers other than Medicare contribute only implicitly to the support of graduate medical education;
Medicare's GME payment is based on each hospital's own historical costs. Consequently, there are unclear and inconsistent
incentives related to the total number of residents and their distribution across geographic areas, programs, and
institutions, as well as to costs per resident.

An all-payer funding mechanism for graduate medical education would base the level and distribution of payments
on a consistent set of criteria. This would provide appropriate incentives for the allocation of resources. It would
also ensure that the costs of training physicians would be borne by both the Medicare and the non-Medicare populations.
Further, a funding mechanism that recognizes the costs of teaching activities regardless of setting would improve
the effectiveness of medical education as well as the equity of payments.



Consistency with National Work Force Goals._

Both the current Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) and the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC)
have extensively examined physician supply and specialty distribution issues. Each of these groups has recommended
limiting the number of residents entering training to 110 percent of the number of graduates from U.S. medical schools.
ProPAC supports limiting the number of resident positions.

COGME and PPRC differ, however, on how they would approach the issue of specialty distribution. COGME advocates increasing
to 50 percent the proportion of primary care residents, which it defines as family practice, general internal medicine,
and general pediatrics. PPRC does not recommend a specific percentage for primary care, but endorses the designation
of a national body to determine the most appropriate specialty distribution of residents. ProPAC supports proposals
that would lead to a more appropriate specialty mix of physicians, including those who serve the special needs of the
Medicare population. These issues, however, need to be reexamined periodically, and an independent group should
be created to monitor and set future work force goals. The Commission believes graduate medical education funding
should be tied to these work force decisions.



Training for Other Categories of Health Care Professionals._

National work force goals should include the appropriate use of both physicians and other categories of health care
professionals. The determination of the appropriate roles for specific categories of medical personnel is beyond
ProPAC's mandate, however. In any event, the availability and distribution of funding should be consistent with
national work force goals.



Payments to Training Programs._

Currently, Medicare pays the hospital for the direct costs of approved graduate medical education programs and direct
medical education costs for the training of nurses and allied health personnel. This provides a strong incentive
in support of hospital-based training and discourages the use of alternative sites, such as physician offices and
other ambulatory settings. The Commission believes GME payments should be made to the training program, rather than
to the hospital. This would allow greater flexibility concerning where and how the residents are trained and would
simplify fundings for residencies that are provided in several settings.

Although ProPAC favors payment to the program rather than to the hospital, questions arise about the appropriate
designation of the entity that would actually receive the payment. These questions need to be addressed before final
determination is made concerning the method for allocating and distributing GME payments.



Per Resident Payment Amount._

The Commission believes GME payments should be based on a national per resident payment amount, adjusted for appropriate
differences in costs across institutions. The current Medicare per resident payment amounts, which are based on
each hospital's own historical costs, vary substantially. Moreover, this variation in payments does not, as a rule,
correspond to observed differences in current costs.

ProPAC has examined some of the reasons for the variation in per resident costs, and has found geographic location
to be a significant factor. In addition, some hospital and program characteristics are correlated with per resident
costs. However, the allocation of overhead also appears to be related to reported costs. Moreover, the results indicate
that the PPS hospital wage index, which measures the cost of all hospital labor inputs, may not be an appropriate adjuster
for residents' wage differences.

The Commission believes further work is necessary to identify appropriate adjustments to a national per resident
payment amount. ProPAC will continue to examine this issue over the coming year.



Funding for Institutions That Lose Training Positions._

Adequate funding should be available to assist hospitals that lose training positions as a result of the reduction
in the total number of positions and the reallocation of these positions across hospitals and other settings. Some
of these institutions rely on residents to provide basic patient care, and the loss of these positions should substantially
increase their costs. Moreover, many of these facilities are located in areas where it is difficult to recruit other
physicians, and many provide care to populations that otherwise might not have access to that care.



Recommendation 5: Quality of Care



The Commission believes there must be an effective quality assurance program for Medicare enrollees, especially
given health reform's emphasis on cost control and proposed cutbacks in Medicare spending. The Peer Review Organization
program should be continued but thoroughly evaluated. It should be replaced only by a program that has been determined
to be more effective.

The Health Security Act eliminates the PRO program and does not replace it with another quality assurance program
for Medicare enrollees. The Commission views this as undesirable, especially given that cutbacks in the rate of growth
in Medicare spending and cost controls in the private insurance market may adversely affect the quality of care provided
to Medicare patients. ProPAC has stressed the importance of a regulatory quality assurance program for Medicare
in past recommendations; it believes that both pattern analysis and individual case review should be continued.

The PRO program should not be eliminated until another way to assess quality proves to be superior. In addition, it
should be evaluated to see what aspects are most effective in improving quality of care. The Health Care Financing
Administration should consider implementing additional quality assurance programs and evaluating them simultaneously
with the PRO program to determine the best way to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care.

Dramatic changes in the PRO program have reduced the emphasis on punitive case review and incorporated pattern analysis
with educational feedback. These changes are consistent with recommendations made by the Institute of Medicine
and others. There are no plans, however, to evaluate this new methodology.

The proposed quality assurance program in the Health Security Act depends largely on collecting and disseminating
information to purchasers, consumers, and providers on quality of care, access to care, and patient satisfaction.
This method of quality assurance is largely untested. Further, under the Act it would not apply to most Medicare enrollees.
The Commission recommends that any quality assurance methodology enacted as part of health reform should be evaluated.
In addition, the methodology should be appropriate for a Medicare-enrolled population.



Recommendation 6: Improvements in Premium Risk Adjustment Methods



The Commission recommends that the Secretary undertake the research necessary to substantially improve current
risk adjustment methods. Risk adjustment will be needed under many health reform proposals to ensure that the premiums
paid to competing health plans accurately reflect the risk composition of their enrollees. Until major improvements
can be made, some other mechanism may be needed to limit the potential impact of enrolling individuals whose care proves
to be exceptionally costly.

<TEXT>
 

Under many health reform proposals, including the President's plan, most individuals would obtain their health
coverage from a health plan that participates in local purchasing alliance. Under some proposals, persons eligible
for Medicaid, along with Medicare enrollees who choose to obtain coverage through the risk program, also would receive
coverage and health services from a health plan that competes in the local alliance. Therefore, the ability to establish
equitable premium payments among competing plans will be important for Medicare and Medicaid enrollees, as well
as for all other citizens.

The Commission believes payment equity among competing health plans will be critical to preserving the long-term
viability of competition within each purchasing alliance. In addition, equitable payment is necessary to promote
and maintain equal access to health services among different population groups, including Medicare and Medicaid
beneficiaries.

Accurate adjustment of plan premiums to reflect the risk composition of plan enrollment is essential to achieve payment
equity among competing health plans. Fair risk adjustment methods are important for two reasons. First, risk adjustment
would ensure that all plans are able to provide a comparable quantity and mix of health services to enrollees with comparable
needs. In the absence of effective risk adjustment, plans that enroll high-risk persons would be forced to limit access
to needed services or take a financial loss. Moreover, such plans would be unable to offer competitive premium rates
over the long run. Conversely, plans that enroll low-risk persons would be able to provide a richer mix of services
or make windfall financial gains. Consequently, these plans would be able to offer favorable premium rates, thereby
securing a competitive advantage. Second, without effective risk adjustment, competing health plans would have
a strong incentive to try to attract a favorable selection of enrollees while avoiding high-risk persons. This could
lead to unequal access to care.

Current methods of risk adjustment appear to have serious deficiencies. Risk adjustment involves using information
about individuals' demographic characteristics, health status, or recent use of health services to predict future
expenditures for health care. Research suggests that even the best combination of available risk indicators accounts
for only a small proportion of the variability in subsequent expenditures among individuals. Therefore, substantial
improvements in these methods and the data to support them are urgently needed.

Until improved risk adjustment methods can be developed, the financial risks and undesirable incentives associated
with unfavorable selection could be limited in other ways. This goal could be accomplished by compensating plans
for a portion of any large losses they experience in providing care to enrollees with extraordinary medical expenses.
This could be done using the traditional reinsurance mechanisms of the private insurance industry. In this case,
health plans could choose to purchase insurance against the occurrence of an adverse claims experience that results
in spending that is much higher than expected. Such insurance would relieve some of the undesirable consequences
of ineffective risk adjustment.

Alternatively, plans' financial risks could be reduced by a mandatory outlier policy analogous to the outlier payment
policy under PPS. Under this policy, all plans' premium revenues would be taxed to provide an outlier payment fund.
This fund would be used to make additional payments to any plan that experiences large losses in providing care to individual
enrollees with extraordinary expenses. Such payments would cover a high proportion of the loss in excess of a fixed
loss threshold. Consequently, this mechanism also would limit plans' losses to the extent that they were attributable
to unfavorable selection. Therefore, it also would mitigate the unwanted effects of inadequate risk adjustment.



Recommendation 7: Controlling Medicare Spending Across All Sites of Care



Medicare should continue to develop policies to monitor and control total expenditure growth across all sites of
care. Payment methods should not unduly favor the choice of one site over another. They should also provide consistent
incentives to constrain increases in volume and service intensity across physicians and other providers.

The Commission endorses the development of prospective payment methods for all services across all sites. These
methods should be designed to offer uniform incentives for efficiency as well as make payments across sites more comparable.
This is particularly important because many services are available in alternative settings. Prospective methods
alone, however, will not address one of the major reasons for expenditure growth: increased volume and intensity
of services. Medicare's physician payment method incorporates such incentives through its volume performance
standards by adjusting fees to reflect the relationship between actual expenditures and an expenditure target.
Other providers are not subject to such direct volume control measures.

Premium caps in the President's proposal provide incentives for health plans to constrain price and service volume
across all settings for non-Medicare enrollees. The modifications to Medicare policies included in the Health Security
Act do not incorporate similar incentives. While the Medicare provisions of the President's plan generally would
reduce the growth in per service payments, spending increases likely would persist due to accelerating volume. The
Medicare program, therefore, should continue to develop volume control methods for all sites of care.

The contribution of expanding utilization to expenditure growth is well-illustrated by Medicare's home health
program. Home health agency charges per visit increased only 4.7 percent annually between 1988 and 1991, yet Medicare
expenditures increased at an average annual rate of 10.8 percent. As another example, the Medicare payment rate for
dialysis services has not risen since 1985, yet expenditures increased at an annual rate of 12.4 percent through 1990.

Several strategies for constraining volume have been identified. One approach is to combine, or bundle, separately
billable services into a single payment unit. A volume performance standard like the one implemented for physician
payment is another method. Finally, managed care arrangements have the potential to control utilization and encourage
care in the most appropriate setting. From a policy standpoint, each of these methods provides certain advantages
and disadvantages. Each also presents different implementation issues. The Medicare program should develop the
most appropriate ways to achieve volume and price control across all services and sites of care. The approaches selected
should create consistent incentives for all providers in all settings.

Medicare benefit and payment policies are fragmented and at times inconsistent across sites and providers. Improvements
in these policies are needed to ensure stable incentives to slow the growth in spending. These changes should reward
efficient resource use while improving the continuum of care for Medicare beneficiaries.



Recommendation 8: Strengthening Medicare's Risk Contracting Program



The Commission recommends that the Secretary improve Medicare's risk-based, managed care program to give more Medicare
beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans. To increase plan participation, deficiencies related
to the risk adjustment formula and local differences in payments need to be corrected.

Medicare's risk-based, managed care program has been shown to improve access and, in some cases, to provide a broader
array of services to Medicare beneficiaries. The program also may have the potential to be cost effective for Medicare,
particularly if evaluated over several years.Furthermore, increased emphasis on risk-based, managed care is consistent
with the President's health care reform proposal. Despite these advantages and the growth of managed care in the private
sector, only 5 percent of all Medicare enrollees participate in Medicare's managed care program. One reason for the
low participation may be the limited availability of managed care options. Health plans have been reluctant to participate
in Medicare's risk-based program because of concerns related to Medicare's payment method. The Commission recommends
that HCFA step up its efforts to improve the methods for determining payments to risk-based, managed care plans, thereby
making this option more available to Medicare beneficiaries.

Participating plans are paid a capitated amount based on 95 percent of each county's average Medicare fee-for-service
expenditures. However, Medicare managed care enrollees' utilization and related expenditure patterns differ
from those with fee-for-service coverage. Managed care enrollees use fewer hospital days and more ambulatory care.
The dissimilarities between the two populations in service use and related spending may not be captured in the current
payment method.

Further, payments based on county-level fee-for-service expenditures are even less representative of the average
spending in areas where managed care enrollment is high. Medicare's policies, therefore, may penalize managed care
plans in counties where they have already helped to slow the growth in fee-for-service spending.

The risk-based, managed care program also has been criticized for failing to make adequate risk adjustments in plan
payment amounts. Medicare uses a limited number of demographic variables to adjust payments for enrollee characteristics
(age, sex, Medicaid status, and institutional status), but these measures are poor predictors of actual expenditures.
Better measures are being investigated that incorporate utilization data for hospital and ambulatory care, prescription
drug use, and other factors directly related to health care use and spending.

HCFA is reviewing ways to improve the payment methods for Medicare's risk-based, managed care contracts. The Commission
recommends that HCFA continue these efforts to strengthen this component of the Medicare program. Providing more
equitable payments could encourage greater plan participation, thereby giving more beneficiaries the option of
enrolling in managed care. Further, evaluations of spending under Medicare managed care should be based on longitudinal
comparisons of beneficiary experience. Medicare's managed care option could become even more important under many
of the health care reform proposals.



Payment Updates



The Commission is mandated by law to report to the Congress each year on an appropriate update to the inpatient hospital
payment rates under PPS. ProPAC considers several factors in developing its annual update recommendation: the hospital
market basket index (which reflects the prices of resources used by hospitals in providing inpatient care), scientific
and technological advances, hospital productivity, case-mix change, and the quality and long-term cost-effectiveness
of health care. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider the Commission's recommendation
in developing her update recommendation. The actual update historically has been legislated by the Congress in the
budget reconciliation process.

In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, the PPS operating update was established for each fiscal
year through 1997. For fiscal year 1995, the update for hospitals in large urban areas (areas with populations over
one million) and other urban areas is set equal to the change in the hospital market basket index minus 2.5 percentage
points. The update for rural hospitals is the amount necessary to bring the rural standardized amount to the same level
as the other urban standardized amount. Even though the fiscal year 1995 update has been set by law, the Commission
has continued its traditional approach of examining the individual factors that together determine the appropriate
update to the PPS payment rates. ProPAC believes this approach results in a payment increase that is sufficient, in
the context of the current health care financing system, to maintain Medicare beneficiaries' access to quality care
while encouraging hospital efficiency in providing that care.

In addition to the update to the PPS payment rates, the Commission recommends an update for the Federal capital payment
rate. ProPAC also recommends an update for rates derived from hospital base-year costs, which may be used in place
of the PPS rates for sole community hospitals. Finally, the Commission considers the update for facilities currently
excluded from PPS. ProPAC's recommendation for an update to the composite payment rate for dialysis services is also
presented.



Recommendation 9: Update Factor for Operating Payments to PPS Hospitals



For fiscal year 1995, the PPS standardized payment amounts should be updated to account for the following:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00253 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The projected increase in the HCFA PPS market basket index, currently estimated at 3.7 percent;

 An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets;

 A negative adjustment of 1.1 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket
forecast;

 A positive adjustment of 0.3 percentage points to reflect the cost-increasing effects of scientific and technological
advances;
 A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity improvements; and

 A net adjustment of zero percentage points for case-mix change.

In addition, a positive adjustment of 3.1 percentage points should be made for hospitals in rural areas to complete
the phase-out of the differential in standardized amounts between rural and other urban hospitals. ProPAC's recommendation
would result in an estimated average update factor of 2.7 percent for fiscal year 1995: an increase of 2.2 percent for
urban hospitals and of 5.3 percent for rural hospitals.

This recommendation reflects the Commission's judgment about the appropriate increase in the level of PPS payment
rates. Since it is based on current projections of the fiscal year 1995 increase in the market basket index, the effective
value of ProPAC's update factor recommendation may be modified as more recent forecasts become available. The components
of ProPAC's update factor recommendation are summarized in Table 2-1, and a discussion of each follows.

It should be noted that the increase in average per case payments in each year exceeds the PPS update. This is because
increases in the Medicare case-mix index (CMI) result in proportionally higher hospital payments. Future changes
in case mix are difficult to predict; however, on the basis of currently available data, ProPAC estimates that the
CMI will rise by 0.9 percent in fiscal year 1995. Based on the Commission's recommendation of a 2.7 percent average
update, the average increase in per case payments would be about 3.6 percent.



PPS Market Basket Forecast and Forecast Error Correction

_The forecasted increase in the market basket index is the expected change in the prices of the resources used during
a typical hospital stay. This forecast is the reference point used in updating the PPS payment rates. The current forecast
is for a 3.7 percent increase in HCFA's PPS market basket index during fiscal year 1995.

In its March 1990 

Report and Recommendations to the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 

ProPAC proposed modifications to the market basket used by HCFA. Although HCFA adopted most of these modifications,
it did not incorporate the key provision that increased the weight of internal hospital wages in the computation of
the market basket index. The Commission believes HCFA's market basket as currently constructed does not adequately
recognize the unique characteristics of the hospital labor market.

Since the PPS update for fiscal year 1995 is legislated relative to HCFA's market basket, that market basket is used
as the basis for ProPAC's update framework. The Commission takes this into account by making an adjustment to allow
for the estimated effect of the modifications it has proposed. However, the current fiscal year 1995 forecast is that
the increase in ProPAC's and HCFA's market baskets will be the same. The corresponding adjustment, therefore, is
zero percentage points.

A forecasted market basket increase of 4.1 percent was used to set payments in fiscal year 1993. The actual market basket
increase, however, was only 3.0 percent. The update for fiscal year 1993 thus was set 1.1 percentage points higher
than if the actual market basket increase had been known at the time.

The Commission believes a correction for substantial error in market basket forecasts in an important part of its
update framework. This correction protects both hospitals and the Federal government by adjusting the base payment
rates so that the effects of past forecast errors (both positive and negative) are removed. Therefore, ProPAC's update
recommendation also includes a ^1.1 percentage point adjustment for fiscal year 1993 market basket forecast error.

Adjustment for Scientific and Technological Advances_

The allowance for scientific and technological advances is a future-oriented policy target. It provides additional
funds for hospitals to adopt quality-enhancing health care advances, even when they increase costs. To develop an
informed judgment about the appropriate level of this allowance, ProPAC annually examines emerging, cost-increasing
technologies and scientific developments. (See Appendix A for more information on the technologies contributing
to the increase.) The Commission believes 0.3 percent is an appropriate level for the operating scientific and technological
advances allowance for fiscal year 1995.


Adjustment for Productivity Improvement_

The productivity adjustment is also a future-oriented policy target. The Commission believes it is reasonable to
expect hospitals to achieve productivity improvements during fiscal year 1995 that are comparable to those achieved
in other sectors of the economy. The recommended adjustment of ^0.7 percentage points is based on ProPAC's determination
that hospital productivity should increase by 1.4 percent and that the savings from such productivity improvement
should be shared equally by hospitals and the Medicare program. The Commission thinks it is appropriate for the costs
of scientific and technological advances to be financed in part by expected productivity gains, to provide an incentive
for hospitals to strive for productivity improvement as they adopt new technologies. (See Appendix A for more information
on trends in hospital productivity.)

Adjustments for Case-Mix Change_

The fiscal year 1995 PPS update should be adjusted to account for the net effect of case-mix change during fiscal year
1994. The net adjustment in this year's update is zero percentage points and reflects the following:
 A 0.9 percentage point reduction for the estimated change in the CMI,
 A positive allowance of 0.7 percentage points for real case-mix change across diagnosis-related groups (DRGs),
and
 A positive allowance of 0.2 percentage points for within-DRG case-complexity change.
Adjusting for these factors allows payments to increase due to real changes in the resources required to treat an average
Medicare patient. At the same time, it removes the effect of changes in medical record documentation and coding practices
that are unrelated to patient resource requirements. (See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of case-mix change.)


Differential Adjustments to the Standardized Amounts_

ProPAC supports the provisions of OBRA 1990 and OBRA 1993 that eliminate the difference between the standardized
payment amounts for rural and other urban areas in fiscal year 1995. This year's update would complete a process begun
in 1991 that has provided higher updates in each year to rural hospitals. The Commission estimates that the differential
would be eliminated if the rural update were 3.1 percentage points higher than the urban update for fiscal year 1995.
Since the beginning of PPS, the ratio of Medicare payments to costs has been higher for urban hospitals than for rural
institutions. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, urban hospitals have benefited more from the PPS
payment adjustments_particularly the effects of CMI change and the IME and DSH adjustments. In addition, rural hospitals
have had large declines in inpatient volume, raising fixed costs per case. However, as indicated in ProPAC's October
1991 report to the Congress, 

Rural Hospitals Under Medicare's Prospective Payment System

, several recent policy changes have improved the relative performance of rural hospitals under PPS. This trend promises
to continue. The Commission will monitor and analyze the further effects of these policies as additional data become
available.


Recommendation 10: Update Factor for Capital Payments to PPS Hospitals


For fiscal year 1995, the Commission recommends that a formula-based approach be used to update capital payment rates.
The capital update should include the following:
 The projected increase in a capital market basket index that measures one-year changes in a fixed basket of
capital goods hospitals purchase, currently estimated at 3.4 percent;
 An adjustment of zero percentage points to correct for past forecast errors;
 An adjustment of zero percentage points to reflect changes in financing costs;
 A positive adjustment of 0.9 percentage points for scientific and technological advances;
 A negative adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to encourage hospital productivity; and
 A net adjustment for zero percentage points for case-mix change.
The Commission's recommendations would result in a 3.6 percent increase in the Federal capital payment rate for both
urban and rural hospitals.
ProPAC believes the capital update should be for future capital purchases. It is designed to provide Medicare capital
payments reflective of future capital replacement prices. It would provide updates appropriate to maintain hospital
capital stock adequate to provide efficient and effective care to Medicare beneficiaries.
The components of the update recommendation are summarized in Table 2-2; a discussion of each of these components
follows. (See Appendix A for more information on the capital update.)


Capital Market Basket_

ProPAC's capital update recommendation reflects projected increases in a market basket index designed to measure
changes in the prices of capital assets hospitals purchase. This index, developed by the Commission, provides a measure
of the increase in capital input prices analogous to that used to update PPS operating payments. (See Recommendation
9.) It also measures annual change in the price of a fixed mix of capital goods.
The recommended market basket includes three price components: building and fixed equipment, movable equipment,
and other capital-related costs such as insurance. The market basket weights reflect hospitals' patterns of capital
acquisition. In the absence of accurate and current information on actual capital purchases, the Commission believes
that shares of depreciation expense, adjusted for other capital-related costs, are the best available measures
of future purchases. Therefore these shares, combined with annual outlays for capital-related costs, are used as
weights in the market basket.




Although updates should apply to the full Medicare capital payment rate, which reflects historical levels of depreciation
and interest, interest rate changes should be handled separately from the market basket. The Commission's financing
policy adjustment addresses the issue of interest rate change in the update framework.
The capital market basket proposed by the Secretary uses a complex structure of weighted average changes in economywide
price proxies and measures of interest expense. Its value is largely determined by historical values of its components.
In ProPAC's view, a straightforward market basket that reflects the change in the price of hospital capital purchases
and other capital-related costs in the coming fiscal year is more appropriate. The recommended market basket would
provide Medicare capital payments reflective of future capital purchase prices.
ProPAC studied a range of alternative capital price measures. In its March 1993 

Report and Recommendations to the Congress

, the Commission recommended using two price proxies especially relevant to hospital industry capital purchases:
for hospital building and fixed equipment capital costs, the Boeckh building cost index subindex for apartments
and office buildings (institutional construction); and for movable equipment capital costs, the Marshall and Swift
hospital equipment index. Changes in other capital-related costs would be measured by the consumer price index for
residential rent. Components would be weighted as discussed above. The market basket would be used to prepare single-year
projections of price change.
As of January 1994, the projected increase in ProPAC's market basket index for fiscal year 1995 is 3.4 percent. This
forecast may change as more up-to-date data become available and methodologies for estimating the components of
the market basket are refined.


Forecast Error Correction_

The Commission believes the correction of past market basket index forecast errors should be part of the update framework.
This correction protects both hospitals and the Federal government by adjusting the payment rates so that the effects
of past forecast errors are not perpetuated. Because a capital market basket has not yet been used to increase capital
payment rates, a correction factor is not needed this year.

Financing Policy Adjustment_

The Commission's capital update frame work includes a financing policy adjustment to account for the effects of changes
in interest rates on hospital capital costs. In ProPAC's view, interest rate fluctuations should not be reflected
in the market basket. If they were, such changes might lead to volatility in updates, overcompensation of hospitals
in some circumstances, and undue risk for facilities at other times. Instead, ProPAC recommends an explicit adjustment
to the capital update factor to account for significant changes in interest rates.
The financing policy adjustment reflects interest rate changes that might otherwise create a significant financial
burden for hospitals, as well as those that would produce substantial reductions in capital costs. It would raise
payments to compensate hospitals faced with disruptive effects of extreme interest rate increases and allow the
Medicare program to share in some of the savings resulting from lower interest rates.
Though relatively high compared with short-term rates and in light of expected inflation, long-term interest rates
are anticipated to remain stable through fiscal year 1995. The Commission believes it is not appropriate to adjust
capital payments for forecasted changes in interest rates at this time.


Scientific and Technological Advances_

ProPAC recognizes that future hospital capital investments may include more costly, quality-enhancing medical
technology. The capital update framework adjusts payments to allow for scientific and technological advances.
(See Recommendation 9.) The Commission recommends a 0.9 percentage point adjustment for the capital component of
scientific and technological advances.


Productivity Improvement_

ProPAC recognizes the need to adapt the capital stock of hospitals to a health care environment with less demand for
inpatient services through its productivity adjustment. This adjustment serves as a target for improvement in productivity
due to more efficient use of plant and equipment and purchase of cost-decreasing technologies. The Commission recommends
an adjustment of ^0.7 percentage points to encourage more efficient use of existing plant and equipment and the purchase
of cost-decreasing technologies. (See Recommendation 9.)


Case-Mix Change_

Medicare uses the same DRG definitions and relative weights for both operating payments and capital payments. As
a result, capital payments, respond to changes in the CMI in the same way as do PPS operating payments. Thus the adjustment
to capital payment rates for CMI change is identical to that made to operating payment rates. (See Recommendation
9.) The net adjustment for case-mix change is zero percentage points.


Recommendation 11: Single Operating and Capital Update Factor


The Commission recommends that when the transition to fully prospective capital payments is complete, a single update
factor be used for adjusting PPS operating and capital payment rates. Based on ProPAC's recommended updates to the
operating and capital payment rates, the total increase to a fully prospective combined payment rate would be 2.8
percent for fiscal year 1995.
The Commission believes there ultimately should be one payment for hospital inpatient operating and capital expenses
and a single annual update to that payment. ProPAC recognizes that a combined capital and operating update factor
cannot be used until the transition to a fully prospective capital payment system is complete. This is because the
update applies only to the prospective portion of capital payment rates. Further, the operating payment update is
currently set by law, while the Secretary has authority to establish capital prospective payment updates through
annual rulemaking. The Medicare program, however, should move to a single update approach for inpatient operating
and capital payment rates as soon as possible. Despite the separate payment methods, hospitals do not distinguish
between their operating and capital payments. Operating payments may be used to defray capital shortfalls and vice
versa. Separate update factors for operating and capital expenses do not reflect the way hospitals actually use their
revenues or make investment decisions.
ProPAC therefore recommends the development and use of an update framework that includes capital and operating components
for fiscal year 1995. Like the operating update use by ProPAC, the combined update approach should incorporate operating
and capital market baskets to measure changes in prices, as well as adjust for productivity, scientific and technological
advances, and case-mix change. This would ensure that updates to both operating and capital base payment rates reflect
increases in the costs of the goods and services that hospitals require to produce inpatient hospital care efficiently.
Ultimately, operating and capital components should be included in a single market basket and set of adjustments.
A combined fully prospective update would yield an average payment rate increase of 2.8 percent under the Commission's
recommendation. The total payment rate increase, however, would be about 3.7 percent, because of expected increases
in the CMI (see Table 2-3).


Recommendation 12: Update Factor for Hospitals Paid on the Basis of Hospital-Specific Rates


The Commission believes payments based on hospital-specific base-year costs for sole community hospitals should
be updated by the average update given to all hospitals.
The recommendation would result in an update to the hospital-specific rates of 2.7 percent for fiscal year 1995, consistent
with the Commission's recommendation on the PPS update. Since the update is based on current projections of the fiscal
year 1995 increase in the market basket index, its effective value may be modified as more recent forecasts become
available.
OBRA 1989 provides that certain hospitals be paid on the basis of the PPS rate, their own 1982 base-year costs updated
to the current year, or their updated 1987 base-year costs, whichever would yield the largest payment. Sole community
hospitals, which meet certain criteria based on distance from other hospitals or market share, qualify for this special
treatment. Provisions affecting small rural Medicare-dependent hospitals, which were defined as rural hospitals
with fewer than 50 beds and at least a 60 percent Medicare share of total discharges or inpatient days, expired with
cost reporting periods ending on or after April 1, 1993. However, OBRA 1993 restored this provision for cost reporting
periods ending before October 1, 1994. For fiscal year 1995. Medicare-dependent hospitals will no longer be paid
on the basis of hospital-specific rates and will be treated like other rural hospitals.







Current law requires that the hospital-specific rates for these hospitals be updated at a rate equal to the expected
average update for all PPS hospitals. ProPAC concurs with this provision. Sole community hospitals are accorded
special treatment under PPS because they may face higher historical costs due to their special circumstances. Nevertheless,
these hospitals should be able to control their cost increases as other hospitals do. Last year, the Commission recommended
that the update for rural areas be applied to the hospital-specific rate, on the grounds that other rural hospitals
are the appropriate comparison group for these hospitals. However, this year's PPS update for rural hospitals (including
sole community hospitals) is substantially higher than the average for all hospitals. The Commission believes the
average increase for all hospitals provides a reasonable update for the hospital-specific rates available to these
facilities.


Recommendation 13: Update Factor for PPS-Excluded Hospitals and Distinct-Part Units


For fiscal year 1995, the largest rates for PPS-excluded hospitals and distinct-part units should be updated by 2.7
percent. This recommendation accounts for the following:
 The projected increase in the HCFA PPS-excluded hospital market basket, currently estimated at 3.7 percent.
 An adjustment of zero percentage points for the difference between the projected ProPAC and HCFA market baskets;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00257 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points for substantial error in the fiscal year 1993 market basket
forecast; and
 An adjustment of zero percentage points for scientific and technological advances.
When PPS was established, it was clear that prospective payment based on DRGs could not be applied universally and
that certain providers would need to be excluded. At this time, five types of specialty hospitals (psychiatric, rehabilitation,
long-term, children's, and cancer) and two types of distinct-part units in general hospitals (psychiatric and rehabilitation)
are exempt from PPS. These providers are excluded primarily because DRGs fail to accurately predict the resource
costs for the patients they treat.
PPS-excluded hospitals and distinct-part units are subject to the payment limitations and incentives established
in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). Each provider is paid on the basis of its current Medicare-allowable
inpatient operating costs per discharge, or a target amount. The target amount is based on the provider's allowable
costs per discharge in a base year, trended to the current year by an annual update factor. Medicare's share of allowable
capital costs is paid in its entirety.
Under TEFRA, a facility with inpatient operating costs per discharge that are less than its target rate receives its
costs plus either 50 percent of the difference between its cost per discharge and the target or 5 percent of the target
amount, whichever is less. A facility with inpatient operating costs per discharge above its target rate receives
the target amount plus half the difference between that amount and its cost per discharge, but no more than 110 percent
of the target. Further, the Secretary is required to provide for an adjustment to a facility's payment when events
beyond the facility's control distort its cost increase for a cost reporting period.
Although the Congress legislates the update to the TEFRA target amounts, ProPAC and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services are required to recommend an annual update factor. For fiscal years 1994 through 1997, each facility will
receive an update ranging from the projected increase in the market basket to the market basket increase minus 1.0
percentage points. The Commission recommends an average update to the target rate equal to the market basket increase
minus 1.0 percentage points for fiscal year 1995 (see Table 2-4).


Market Basket_

The update recommendation is determined primarily by the projected increase in the PPS-excluded market basket index,
which measures the price of inputs used by these facilities in treating Medicare patients. The current HCFA market
basket increase forecast for fiscal year 1995 is 3.7 percent. There is no difference between the HCFA and ProPAC market
basket forecasts for 1995, so no adjustment to reflect this difference is necessary.


Forecast Error Correction._

ProPAC believes the update should be corrected for substantial past market basket forecast errors. Because projections
must rely on available data, they cannot accurately anticipate all future economic conditions that may affect input
prices. Updates based on market basket forecasts, therefore, may result in overpayments or underpayments to PPS-excluded
facilities, which should not be carried forward to subsequent payment years. The market basket projection used to
update TEFRA target amounts in fiscal year 1993 was 4.2 percent. The actual market basket increase, however, was only
3.2 percent. Therefore, ProPAC's update recommendation includes a ^1.0 percentage point adjustment for fiscal
year 1993 market basket forecast error.








Scientific and Technological Advances_

ProPAC also believes the update should include an allowance for scientific and technological advances for PPS-excluded
hospitals and distinct-part units. This allowance is intended to encourage providers to adopt quality-enhancing
technologies, even when they increase costs. It reflects the Commission's judgment about the expected growth in
the cost of providing inpatient services resulting from scientific and technological advances.
To reach an informed judgment on the appropriate allowance, ProPAC examined emerging technologies used in PPS-excluded
facilities to estimate their operating costs and predict their increased use in fiscal year 1995. (See Appendix A
for a full discussion of ProPAC's methodology.) To be included in the estimate, a technology must be emerging (that
is, diffused beyond minimal use but not fully diffused), quality-enhancing, and cost-increasing. The contractor
identified two scientific advances that met these criteria: the drugs sertraline hydrochloride and ondanestron
hydrochloride. The total increase in operating costs due to these advances is estimated to be $140,000, or 0.002 percent
of Medicare payments to PPS-excluded facilities in fiscal year 1995. Therefore, the Commission is recommending
no allowance for scientific and technological advances.
Unlike the update for PPS hospitals, the update for excluded facilities does not include a productivity adjustment.
The productivity adjustment to the PPS update is based on the principle that Medicare should share in the savings generated
by productivity improvements. However, Medicare automatically shares in the savings under TEFRA because part of
any productivity increase is factored into reduced Medicare payments. ProPAC believes a further reduction in payments
for gains in productivity is not appropriate.


Revising the Payment Method_

In October 1992, the Commission submitted an interim report on payment reform for PPS-excluded providers. The findings
suggested that in aggregate, TEFRA payments to PPS-excluded facilities appeared adequate for most provider types.
Notable exceptions were psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part units, and long-term hospitals. However, substantial
variation in the proportion of facilities with costs exceeding their target rate was found across and within all provider
types. Further, the Commission could not make definitive conclusions regarding the adequacy of the TEFRA payment
system due to the lack of information on the amount of exceptions payments made to PPS-excluded providers.
Specialty hospitals and distinct-part units were excluded from PPS primarily because the DRG patient classification
system does not adequately group patients in these facilities according to resource use. However, considerable
effort has been put into developing a patient classification system for rehabilitation hospitals and distinct-part
units based on patient functional status. The Commission supports such efforts in hope that a prospective payment
system for specialty facilities can be developed.
Although at this time prospective payment for these facilities is not feasible, modifications to the current TEFRA
payment method may be possible. Each type of PPS-excluded provider has unique patient characteristics and cost experiences,
yet for payment purposes all types are treated similarly. TEFRA does not recognize varying factors that affect costs,
such as changes in case mix and treatment patterns, and all providers receive the same basic update to the target rate.
A more complete understanding of the factors that differentiate these facilities may help to identify appropriate
revisions to the current TEFRA payment system and update formula.
ProPAC encourages the Secretary to examine further the factors contributing to cost increases among these facilities.
The Commission will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the TEFRA system for PPS-excluded providers, and
will respond to the Secretary's proposal for payment reform when it becomes available.


Recommendation 14: Update to the Composite Rate for Dialysis Services


The fiscal year 1995 update recommendations for the composite rate for dialysis services accounts for the following:


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-1-00258 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The projected increase in the market basket for dialysis services in fiscal year 1995, estimated at 4.3 percent;

 A positive adjustment of 0.7 percentage points to reflect the additional costs associated with scientific
and technological advances;

 A negative adjustment of 1.0 percentage points to encourage productivity improvements; and

 A negative discretionary adjustment of 4.0 percentage points to reflect the relationship between payments
and estimated fiscal year 1994 costs.

 This results in a net update recommendation of zero percent.

In 1972, the Congress extended Medicare coverage to almost all U.S. residents with end-stage renal disease. These
beneficiaries are entitled to all Medicare-covered services, including dialysis treatments or transplant services
to replace lost kidney function. Since 1983, payment for outpatient dialysis services has been based on a composite
rate. The composite rate is a prospective payment intended to cover the costs of services typically furnished during
a dialysis treatment. Derived from data from 1977 through 1979, it represents a weighted average cost per treatment
for dialysis provided in facilities and at home according to the proportion of beneficiaries treated in each site.
This method was intended to promote the less expensive home treatment alternative by paying the same amount for care
provided in either site. The level of the composite rate has remained essentially unchanged since it was developed.

OBRA 1990 mandated that ProPAC recommend an annual update to dialysis payments. In developing its recommendation,
the Commission first estimated how much payments should increase between fiscal years 1994 and 1995 using a methodology
similar to that employed in the update recommendation for PPS hospital payments. Then it evaluated the appropriateness
of the base payment rate to which the update factor would be applied. (See Appendix A for more information on the background
analyses.)



Market Basket

_The market basket index measures changes in the price of inputs dialysis facilities use to produce dialysis treatments.
It is based on a set of input components that reflect all the goods and services dialysis providers purchase. Using
1992 dialysis facility cost report data, four types of inputs were identified: capital, labor, other direct costs,
and overhead. Each component has a weight that represents its cost share, or proportion of total expenses. The price
change for each component is measured by a proxy. The price proxies were adapted from those Medicare uses for the PPS,
home health agency, and skilled nursing facility market baskets. The Commission estimates that the prices of inputs
used in a dialysis treatment will rise 4.3 percent between fiscal years 1994 and 1995.



Scientific and Technological Advances

_The scientific and technological advances allowance is intended to encourage dialysis facilities to adopt new
technologies that improve the quality of patient care, even when they increase costs. It is an estimate of the combined
operating and capital costs of new and emerging dialysis-related technologies, and their expected increase in use
for the coming fiscal year. To reach an informed judgment on the appropriate allowance, ProPAC examined a set of the
most important new cost-increasing innovations in the dialysis industry. On the basis of this analysis, the Commission
concluded that Medicare payments should rise by 0.7 percent to cover the costs of new technologies in fiscal year 1995.



Productivity Improvement

_The productivity adjustment is intended to give dialysis facilities a financial incentive for continued improvements
in productivity through the more efficient use of resources. It is an estimate of the productivity gains that can be
expected for the coming year. The Commission considered a range of options to reach an appropriate adjustment. ProPAC's
historical productivity study and recent trends in the cost per dialysis treatment suggest a higher estimate may
be appropriate. Concerns that further reductions in the length of dialysis sessions may adversely affect quality
of care support a lower adjustment. ProPAC concluded that a modest productivity target of 2.0 percent arrives at the
proper balance. The savings from productivity gains should be shared equally by the industry and Medicare, resulting
in a productivity adjustment of ^1.0 percentage points.

Discretionary Adjustment_

ProPAC's analysis indicates that in aggregate, the estimated cost per dialysis treatment in fiscal year 1994 is about
5 percent below the median wage-adjusted composite rate. This varies by type of facility. The estimated cost per treatment
for independent facilities is about 13 percent below the payment rate. Costs are about 16 percent above payments for
hospital-based facilities. Determining the true difference between payments and costs was complicated by data
deficiencies. Nonetheless, the Commission believes it is important to recognize this difference in its update recommendation
through an adjustment to the base composite rate.
The latest cost data probably are overstated substantially because they have not been audited, although the magnitude
of this effect is not known. Inconsistent cost reporting practices and cost allocation methods raise additional
concerns about data comparison and reliability across facilities. Further, government regulations implemented
in 1992 have likely increased facility costs, but the exact amount is not known. In the Commission's judgment, a discretionary
adjustment of ^4.0 percentage points balances the need to account for the difference between 1994 estimated costs
and payments with uncertainties regarding the current level of costs.
ProPAC appreciates HCFA's continued efforts in compiling the database of unaudited dialysis facility cost reports
and in auditing a sample of fiscal year 1991 cost reports. These data are important in developing annual update recommendations.
The Commission supports HCFA's actions to improve the quality of the cost data by adding edits to the Hospital Cost
Report Information System, revising the cost report schedules and instructions, and working with facilities and
fiscal intermediaries to ensure that cost reports are filed correctly and completely. These measures will enhance
the accuracy and reliability of the data, which is essential for decision making.
ProPAC will continue to evaluate payments to dialysis facilities. Its analysis will focus on the difference between
payments and costs and how this relationship varies across providers. Additionally, ProPAC will take a closer look
at the disparity between reported and audited costs to better assess the adequacy of payments. Because accurate and
reliable data are crucial to this undertaking, the Commission urges HCFA to continue its measures to improve data
quality and to regularly audit a representative sample of independent and hospital-based dialysis facility cost
reports.


Other Payment Policies


PPS adjusts hospital payments in several ways to account for factors that may legitimately affect hospital costs,
such as the level of teaching activity, wage rates, and patient mix.
As part of its mandate, the Commission examines the distribution of PPS payments across hospitals and makes recommendations
concerning the various adjustments to the payment system. ProPAC considers adjustments that are made both at a hospital
level and at a case level. In this year's report, the Commission recommends improvements in the PPS hospital wage index,
outlier payment policy, and the indirect medical education adjustment.
ProPAC is also responsible for making recommendations on Medicare payment for facility services provided in settings
other than the inpatient hospital. These payments have grown rapidly throughout the 1980s and have become an increasingly
important part of the Commission's agenda. In this report, ProPAC's recommendations concern payment to skilled
nursing facilities and hospital outpatient facilities.


Recommendation 15: Improvements in Hospital Wage Data


The Secretary should develop and implement improved methods for collecting data on employee compensation and paid
hours of employment for hospital workers by occupational category. Once these data become available, the Secretary
should implement an adjustment to the hospital wage index under PPS. This adjustment would correct the wage index
for the inappropriate effects of including geographic differences in the mix of occupations employed.
The PPS wage index is intended to measure geographic differences in the unit prices of labor inputs hospitals purchase
to provide inpatient services. Currently, hospitals report only total compensation and total paid hours for all
employees, regardless of occupation. Consequently, the average hourly wage calculated for each labor market area
measures the average labor cost per hour for hospitals in the area, reflecting both unit prices for labor and the occupational
mix of employees.
The Commission believes the wage index should adjust payments for relative differences in local labor prices, rather
than in costs. While local market prices for labor presumably are determined by forces beyond the control of an individual
hospital, the quantity and skill mix of labor purchased clearly result from management decisions. Differences among
hospitals in mission, services offered, and patient population served may lead to variations in the volume and mix
of labor required to produce needed inpatient services. The resulting differences in operating cost per discharge,
however, are accounted for by other hospital-specific adjustments in PPS, such as the case-mix index, and by the indirect
medical education and disproportionate share adjustments.
Hospitals located in large cities tend to employ a substantially more expensive mix of labor than hospitals located
in rural areas. Consequently the current wage index values for large urban areas tend to be too high, while those for
rural areas tend to be too low. This results in overpayment for some hospitals and underpayment for others.
Previous ProPAC studies of 1988 occupation-specific compensation data reported by California hospitals suggest
that an adjustment for occupational mix would increase the current wage index values for rural hospitals and decrease
those for hospitals located in large urban areas. In 1992, the Commission again used the California data to examine
the effect of occupational mix adjustment on wage indexes based on hospital-specific labor market areas. The results
from this study were consistent with ProPAC's earlier findings. Adjustment for occupational mix may be particularly
important for hospitals located in areas where there are few other hospitals.
Differences in occupational mix are an important factor affecting the accuracy of the wage index and equity of payment
under PPS. To address this problem, the Commission previously has recommended collecting compensation and employee
hours data by occupational category. However, the Secretary has rejected this recommendation on several grounds,
including the burden that would be imposed on the hospital industry and lingering doubts about the likely accuracy
of occupation-specific data. The Commission believes accurate occupation-specific data can and should be obtained
to correct the continuing bias in the wage index. Further, the burden of collecting such data could be minimized by
adapting methods currently used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to collect occupation-specific data for the employment
cost index.
A second set of issues relates to the timeliness and accuracy of the wage data. Accurate and timely data are essential
to improve equity of payments among hospitals under PPS. These issues are important because the wage index directly
affects the distribution of about 70 percent of all payments under PPS, or some $42 billion per year.
Under current law, the Secretary is required to update the wage index annually, beginning in fiscal year 1994. The
wage data collected on hospitals' annual cost reports for this purpose, however, will continue to lag by three to four
years because of the length of the cost reporting cycle, intermediary auditing, and data submission to HCFA. In addition,
the wage data many hospitals submitted on their fiscal year 1990 cost reports were initially inaccurate or substantially
incomplete. HCFA's experience collecting wage data by mail survey, with or without occupation-specific data, has
been equally poor.
ProPAC believes the implementation of a new wage index based on hospital-specific market areas may help to improve
the accuracy of the wage data. (See Recommendation 16.) With a nearest neighbor approach, a hospital's own data would
generally have more influence on its wage index than is now the case. Therefore, hospital administrators may be more
strongly motivated to ensure the quality of the information they submit.
Adjustment of the wage index for occupational mix would substantially improve payment equity among hospitals under
the current PPS labor market definitions. It would be equally desirable for a wage index based on nearest neighbor
labor market areas. In this case, ProPAC believes an occupational-mix adjustment would reduce variation in wage
index values among nearby hospitals and would help the wage index more accurately reflect the labor price levels hospitals
face.

Recommendation 16: Improvements in the PPS Hospital Wage Index



The Secretary should substantially revise the hospital wage index under PPS for fiscal year 1995. The revised wage
index should be calculated using hospital-specific labor market definitions based on hospital geographic proximity
measured by the air-mile distances between nearby hospitals. The Congress should repeal the current statutory provisions
relating to geographic reclassification for the wage index.

The Commission believes the wage index would be substantially more accurate if it were calculated using hospital-specific
labor market areas based on geographic proximity rather than on political boundaries, as is now the case. Under this
approach, a labor market area would be defined for each hospital (the target hospital), including only hospitals
located in its immediate vicinity. Consequently, each hospital's ``nearest neighbor'' wage index would reflect
its own wage rate averaged with those paid by other nearby hospitals.

This approach has strong intuitive appeal. Hospitals located near each other represent potential alternative sources
of employment for health care workers living in the area. Therefore, in almost all instances, the average wage rate
paid by all nearby hospitals should provide a reasonably accurate measure of the amount the target hospital must pay
to compete for labor.

ProPAC's analysis suggests that hospital-specific labor market areas offer important advantages compared with
the present definitions. The current market areas have fixed borders defined by the county and state boundaries of
metropolitan statistical areas and statewide rural areas. Hospitals located near each other but on opposite sides
of such borders often have widely different wage indexes and PPS payment rates, even though they face similar local
market conditions. By contrast, nearest neighbor labor markets for nearby hospitals overlap substantially, including
many of the same hospitals. This tends to reduce the likelihood of large differences in their wage index values.

A second advantage is that nearest neighbor labor market areas generally are much smaller than the current labor market
areas. Consequently, they more effectively capture geographic differences in market wage levels.

Under current policy, hospitals located in the same labor market area have the same wage index, which is based on the
average wage for the area. Excluding the effects of geographic reclassification, about 65 percent of all PPS hospitals
incur a large loss or a large gain because their hourly wage rates differ from the labor market average by more than 5
percent. Because many labor market areas are large, however, local hospital wage levels often vary substantially
within them. As a result, a significant portion of the losses and gains currently experienced by individual hospitals
are attributable to their location in a part of the market area where local wage rates are higher or lower than the labor
market average. Although many of these hospitals pay wage rates that are consistent with those of other nearby hospitals,
they are inappropriately penalized or rewarded because the local wage level differs from the labor market average.
This results in inequitable payment.

Under a nearest neighbor approach, each hospital's wage index would be based on the level of wage rates paid by hospitals
located nearby. Consequently, many of the hospitals that now face large losses or gains would find these discrepancies
reduced or eliminated. Other hospitals are inappropriately sheltered by the current system. Many of these hospitals
would find their small losses or gains substantially altered, reflecting the level of wages in their immediate area.

Implementation of a nearest neighbor wage index in fiscal year 1995 would result in a substantial redistribution
of PPS payments among hospitals. However, these changes would make payments more accurate and equitable.

ProPAC has examined a number of alternatives for determining the most appropriate size of nearest neighbor labor
market areas. Increases in the size of the market areas tend to have two different effects. On the one hand, the wage
index values for nearby hospitals are less likely to be substantially different. Consequently, hospitals located
near each other are less apt to be paid significantly different PPS payment rates. This occurs because each hospital's
wage index is based on wage data for a larger number of hospitals.

On the other hand, larger market areas include hospitals that are located farther from the target hospital. Consequently,
wage rates within each area tend to vary more. This suggests that some of the more distant hospitals may face labor market
conditions that differ from those in the immediate vicinity of the target hospital. Therefore, using larger market
areas may yield wage index values that are less accurate indicators of the labor market conditions faced by the target
hospital.

Finding a balance between these conflicting outcomes is complicated by the fact that hospital circumstances vary
widely. About 30 percent of all PPS hospitals are located in relatively high density areas, with seven or more other
PPS hospitals located within a radius of 20 miles. At the other end of the spectrum, 46 percent of all PPS hospitals are
located in low density areas, with fewer than three other hospitals located within 20 miles.

For hospitals in areas where there are many other hospitals nearby, hospital-specific labor market areas could include
the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile radius. This would keep the variability in wage rates at a low level, while
limiting the frequency of large differences in wage indexes among nearby hospitals. For hospitals located in areas
with few hospitals nearby, hospital-specific markets should include at least three other hospitals. In many instances,
this would require going beyond 20 miles. To avoid incorporating hospitals facing substantially different labor
market conditions, however, the maximum distance should be 30 to 35 miles.

In short, a labor market area could be defined for each hospital by including the nearest 15 hospitals within a 20-mile
radius, but going up to a maximum of 30 to 35 miles to find at least three other hospitals. Although any of these criteria
could be modified, minor changes probably would not make the wage index less accurate. A wage index based on labor market
definitions similar to those outlined above would, in ProPAC's view, be far more accurate than the current one.

Implementation of this approach would impose both one-time and ongoing administrative burdens on HCFA. For example,
HCFA would need to verify the latitude and longitude coordinates for each PPS hospital. Methods and procedures would
need to be developed for incorporating new hospitals into the wage index, and for dealing with multi-campus hospitals.

In addition, HCFA would need to devise methods and administrative processes for addressing requests for exceptions.
The Commission's research shows that hospital-specific labor market areas defined using air-mile distances generally
correspond closely with those defined using road miles. Differences will occur, however, because of the presence
of major transportation barriers such as a river or mountainous terrain. An exceptions process may be needed where
a road-mile definition would produce a substantially different wage index.

ProPAC recognizes that adoption of a new wage index based on nearest neighbor labor markets will have a significant
effect on PPS payments for many hospitals. This effect is due partly to changes in the labor market definitions, and
partly to eliminating geographic reclassification for the wage index. The Commission believes strongly that continued
reclassification of the wage index would not be needed once a nearest neighbor wage index is implemented.

Hospitals whose wage index values are reduced by the adoption of a nearest neighbor wage index would receive lower
payments because of this change. ProPAC believes, however, that such changes in hospital wage index values generally
would reflect improvements in accuracy and fairness. Hospitals whose wage indexes decline would be primarily those
previously sheltered by their inclusion in an appropriately large labor market area or those that received an in appropriately
high wage index because of geographic reclassification.



Recommendation 17: Nursing Facility Wage Index



The Secretary should collect data on employee compensation and paid hours of employment for employees of nursing
facilities that care for Medicare skilled nursing facility patients. Once these data become available, the Secretary
should develop a nursing facility wage index and use it to adjust Medicare skilled nursing facility payments.

Medicare payments to nursing facilities are adjusted by the hospital wage index to reflect geographic differences
in labor costs. Yet the geographic differentials in the cost of labor for hospital employees differ from those for
employees of nursing facilities. This may be because there are state variations in regulations affecting staffing
of nursing facilities that differ from those of hospitals. Further, through their Medicaid programs and certification
and oversight roles, states have a major impact on the costs and structure of nursing facilities. Some of this variation
is being reduced through provisions in OBRA 1987 that mandated stepped-up Federal oversight of nursing facilities.

Another potential reason why the geographic differentials in hospital wages do not adequately reflect variation
in nursing facility wages may be skill mix differences. Compared with hospitals, nursing facilities employ more
aides. The relative differences in the salaries of aides and nurses may not be the same across geographic areas. These
differences in the employee mix and relative wages are not reflected by the hospital wage index.

An accurate wage index is necessary to account for geographic differences in wages. As with the hospital wage index,
the method used to collect wage and hour data for nursing facilities should be prospective. Further, the Commission
suggests the Secretary phase in the use of the nursing facility wage index to allow facilities to adjust.

ProPAC recognizes that collecting nursing facility wage data and developing an index may take several years. The
Commission investigated an interim approach of separate cost limits for each Census division to account for geographic
cost differences. (See Appendix A for a more complete discussion.) This technique substantially changed the distribution
of payments compared with the way payments were allocated under the current hospital wage index or a simulated nursing
facility wage index. It inappropriately adjusted for cost variation caused by differences in state Medicaid payment
policies and rates and other state certification requirements. The Commission thus rejects the interim measure,
recommending instead that efforts focus on the development of a nursing facility wage index.



 Recommendation 18: Improving Outlier Payment Policy



The Commission believes the outlier payment provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 will improve
the current policy for identifying outlier cases and determining outlier payments under PPS. However, the following
changes also should be implemented for fiscal year 1995:

 The estimated cost of the case and the outlier payment amount should no longer be adjusted to reflect the hospital's
indirect medical education and disproportionate share status.

 The marginal cost factor for cost outliers should be increased to 80 percent.

 These changes would further increase the effectiveness of outlier payment in protecting against the risk
of large losses on some cases. They would also improve the distribution of outlier payments across hospitals, including
hospitals that receive a large number of transfer cases.

The DRGs used to determine PPS payment are designed to group cases with similar resource requirements. The hospital's
payment for each case is based on the nationwide average cost of patients in the DRG. The hospital is at risk for the difference
between the cost of the case and the payment it receives. However, costs for individual cases in any DRG may vary widely,
due to patient-specific or treatment-specific factors that are not incorporated in the current classification
system. Even an efficient hospital, therefore, may have some cases with much higher than average resource requirements.
These cases represent large financial losses to the hospitals that threat them.

In general, most hospitals should be able to offset losses from more costly cases with gains from less costly ones.
However, this averaging principle does not adequately protect hospitals with a small number of admissions, because
they may be unable to offset the losses associated with an occasional very costly case. It also fails to protect certain
hospitals that regularly care for a greater than average share of costly patients.

To recognize this, additional payment is provided to hospitals for cases that are exceptionally resource intensive.
Outlier payment is also intended to protect against incentives that may adversely affect certain types of patients
or cases that are perceived to be associated with a greater likelihood of financial loss.



Definition of Outlier Cases

_Currently, hospitals receive additional payment for cases that have exceptionally long stays (day outliers) or
high costs (cost outliers). Cases that qualify as both day and cost outliers are paid according to the formula that
yields the highest payment. Over time, there has been increased emphasis on cost as a criterion for identifying outlier
cases and determining outlier payments. The estimated proportion of outlier payments based on the day outlier formula
has fallen from 85 percent in fiscal year 1984 to 32 percent in fiscal year 1994.

The Commission consistently has supported the increased emphasis on cost outliers relative to day outliers because
the cost criterion better identifies the cases associated with the largest losses to the hospital. In its March 1993


Report and Recommendations to the Congress,

 ProPAC recommended eliminating day outlier payments over a three-year period. In OBRA 1993, the Congress required
that payments for day outlier cases be phased out beginning in fiscal year 1995 and ending in fiscal year 1998.

As the emphasis on cost outliers grows, however, it becomes more important to measure case-level costs accurately.
Because costs are not reported for individual cases, the only way to identify cost outlier cases is to adjust reported
charges. The Commission intends to analyze alternative methods for estimating case-level costs, their relative
accuracy, and their implications for the distribution of outlier payments.



Outlier Thresholds

_A case does not qualify for outlier payment unless it exceeds the day or cost outlier threshold. One problem with the
current threshold is that the loss incurred before outlier payments begin is not the same for every DRG, because DRGs
have different payment amounts. Further, the loss is not the same for every hospital, because the cost of each case
is adjusted by the hospital's IME and DSH payment adjustments.

A threshold based on a fixed loss_that is, one that is set so that the loss incurred before outlier payments begin is
equivalent for every case and hospital_would be more effective in reducing the impact of large losses associated
with individual cases. In its March 1993 

Report and Recommendations to the Congress, 

the Commission recommended that the cost outlier threshold for each case at each hospital should be a fixed amount
(adjusted for differences in area wages and cost of living) above the DRG payment rate for the case. In OBRA 1993, the
Congress enacted this change, to begin in fiscal year 1995.

Another issue is whether estimated costs and outlier payments should be adjusted to reflect the hospital's teaching
and disproportionate share status. Currently, the estimated cost for each case is reduced by the hospital's IME and
DSH payment adjustments. For example, a case costing $50,000 at a teaching or disproportionate share hospital is
considered less costly for the purposes of outlier payment than one costing $50,000 at a non-teaching, non-disproportionate
share hospital. The amount by which the estimated cost exceeds the outlier threshold (which determines the outlier
payment amount) thus is smaller for the case treated at the teaching or disproportionate share hospital. The resulting
outlier payment amount is then increased by the hospital's IME and DSH adjustments, but this generally is not enough
to offset the loss in outlier payments resulting from the reduced cost estimate for the case.

ProPAC's analysis indicates that these adjustments result in substantial underpayment for outlier cases treated
by teaching and disproportionate share hospitals. The IME and DSH adjustments should apply to the base payment amount
that hospitals receive for every case. Outlier payments, on the other hand, are intended to defray the loss incurred
beyond some threshold in treating exceptionally expensive cases. Teaching or disproportionate share hospitals
should not have to bear greater losses before outlier payments begin than do otherwise similar hospitals. Moreover,
outlier payments should be based on the loss incurred on the case rather than the hospital's teaching or disproportionate
share status.

Marginal Cost Factors_

Once a case exceeds the relevant outlier threshold, the payment rate depends on the marginal cost factor. For example,
hospitals are paid 75 percent of the estimated cost beyond the threshold for cost outliers and therefore must bear
25 percent of the additional estimated cost beyond the threshold. This is intended to provide an incentive to continue
to control the costs of outlier cases. In addition, it is believed that the additional payment for outlier cases should
be less than the estimated cost beyond the threshold because of a potential bias in the way cost is estimated.

The changes discussed above would improve the effectiveness of outlier payment policy in identifying and directing
payment to the most costly cases. Outlier payments no longer would be made for cases on which the hospital incurs only
small losses or even gains. Given these changes, the Commission believes it would be appropriate to compensate hospitals
for a higher percentage of the losses beyond the cost outlier threshold. The marginal cost factor for cost outliers
therefore should be raised to 80 percent.



Outlier Payment Pool_

The outlier pool is expressed in terms of the percentage of total PPS payments (excluding the IME and DSH adjustments)
that is set aside for outlier payments. By law, it must be between 5.0 percent and 6.0 percent; it currently is set at
5.1 percent.

Last year, ProPAC recommended that the outlier payment pool should be increased to 6.0 percent of total PPS payments.
Upon further examination, however, the Commission has determined that the reduction in DRG payment rates required
to fund a larger outlier pool would offset the benefit from reduced losses that hospitals would have to incur before
outlier payments begin (see the discussion below). The Commission will continue to examine the implications of changing
the size of the outlier pool in the context of recent and proposed changes in outlier payment policy.



Financing Outlier Payments_

Outlier payments are financed by across-the-board reductions in the DRG payment amounts for urban and rural hospitals_5.5
percent and 2.3 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 1994. These reductions reflect the difference in the anticipated
percentages of outlier payments for the two groups. In fiscal year 1995, with the elimination of the differential
between the standardized payment amounts for rural and other urban areas, these reductions will be equal for all hospitals.

Recent ProPAC analyses indicate that outlier cases and payments are concentrated among groups of hospitals and DRGs.
These findings suggest that financing outlier payments by an equal reduction in the basic DRG rate paid for each case
results in overpayment for DRGs with a high percentage of outlier payments and underpayment for DRGs with a low percentage
of outlier payments.

Financing outlier payments by reducing the payment rates for cases in each DRG, based on the anticipated percentage
of outlier payments in that DRG, holds promise in improving the effectiveness of outlier payments and overall payment
equity. Last year, ProPAC recommended this change. The Commission is concerned, however, about the potential redistribution
of payments that would result. ProPAC intends to continue its work on this issue, specifically in analyzing the impact
on payments across hospitals and types of cases.



Transfer Cases and High-Transfer Hospitals_

ProPAC has also examined the impact of the outlier payment changes enacted in OBRA 1993 and the additional changes
proposed by the Commission. The results indicate that while the OBRA 1993 changes generally target a higher proportion
of outlier payments to the most expensive cases, they actually reduce estimated payments to transfer cases and the
hospitals that most frequently receive them.

This reduction is due largely to the application of the IME and DSH payment adjustments in estimating outlier costs
and calculating outlier payments. As discussed earlier, the application of these adjustments results in substantial
underpayment for outlier cases at teaching and disproportionate share hospitals. Because many of the hospitals
that receive the most transfer cases are teaching hospitals, and because a high proportion of transfer cases are outliers,
the effect on these cases and hospitals is particularly adverse.

The implementation of the additional changes recommended by the Commission would substantially increase payments
for transfer cases and hospitals that receive a large number of these cases, by targeting more outlier payments to
the cases associated with the largest losses. ProPAC's analysis of these issues will be described in more detail in
its technical report, 

Outlier Payment Policy 

(June 1994).



Recommendation 19: Level of the Indirect Medical Education Adjustment to PPS Operating Payments



The Commission recommends that the indirect medical education adjustment to PPS operating payments be reduced from
its current level of 7.7 percent to 7.0 percent for fiscal year 1995. This reduction should be implemented with the
anticipated decrease in indirect medical education payments returned to all hospitals through a proportionate
increase in the standardized payment amounts. The Commission also recommends continuation of the indirect medical
education adjustment to PPS payments until an alternative system of compensating appropriately for the higher costs
of patient care in teaching institutions is fully operational.

The IME adjustment is intended to recognize the higher costs teaching hospitals incur in treating Medicare patients.
These higher costs have been attributed to caring for patients with more severe or complex illnesses, providing a
broader scope of services and more services per patient, and using a costlier mix of staff.

ProPAC annually estimates the relationship between teaching intensity and standardized Medicare operating costs
per discharge. The standardization controls for differences in costs that are accounted for by other PPS payment
factors. These include geographic differences in the PPS base payment amounts, the local area wage index, the hospital's
Medicare case-mix index, and outlier payments for extremely long or costly cases. The most recent analysis was based
on cost data from the eighth year of PPS and payment rules for fiscal year 1994. The results indicate that, on average,
a 10 percent difference in teaching intensity is associated with a 5.2 percent difference in Medicare operating costs
per discharge.

The estimated relationship between costs and teaching intensity is affected by other aspects of the payment system.
For example, the differential in rural and other urban standardized payment amounts will be eliminated in fiscal
year 1995. If the elimination of this differential were effective in fiscal year 1994, the IME estimate would rise
to 5.3 percent. Implementation of improvements in the PPS hospital wage index and outlier payment policy would increase
Medicare payments to teaching hospitals. (See Recommendations 16 and 18.) These changes also would require that
the IME adjustment be reduced to reflect more accurately the relationship between costs and teaching intensity.

The Commission recognizes that since PPS began, the Medicare program has more than adequately compensated teaching
hospitals for the costs of treating medicare patients. The current 7.7 percent IME operating payment adjustment
is substantially higher than the empirical estimate of 5.2 percent indicated by the most recent analysis. Moreover,
PPS operating margins consistently have been higher for teaching hospitals than for nonteaching hospitals. PPS
margins have been especially high for major teaching hospitals (that is, those with the highest levels of teaching
intensity).

However, the Commission is concerned that the continued operation of these hospitals and the fulfillment of their
unique role in the provision of health care might be impaired by a substantial immediate reduction of Federal support.
ProPAC believes the Medicare program's responsibility to its enrollees is broader than merely paying for services
for beneficiaries. This responsibility includes maintaining access to the quality of care and types of services
available at teaching hospitals, which might be affected adversely by a sharp decline in IME payments.

Given these considerations, the Commission believes a gradual reduction of the IME adjustment is a prudent course
of action. ProPAC's recommendation would reduce the adjustment by approximately one-third of the difference between
the current adjustment and the Commission's estimate of 5.2 percent. The Commission will continue to examine the
financial status of teaching hospitals to avoid any deleterious effects on access to quality care for Medicare enrollees.
This approach recognizes as an ultimate objective the use of the IME adjustment to compensate appropriately for differences
in Medicare costs that are attributable to differences in teaching intensity.

The Health Security Act would eliminate the IME adjustment to PPS payments beginning in fiscal year 1996. Instead,
Medicare and all other payers would contribute to an Academic Health Center Account, from which the Secretary would
distribute payments to teaching institutions. Medicare's proposed $2.1 billion contribution to this account in
1996 is based, in part, on estimated IME expenditures using a 3.0 percent IME payment adjustment.

The 3.0 percent factor is consistent with previous estimates_using HCFA's methodology_of the relationship between
teaching intensity and Medicare inpatient operating cost per case. This consistency, however, is an artifact of
HCFA's analytic approach, which offsets the disproportionate share hospital payment adjustment against each hospital's
Medicare costs per discharge. ProPAC does not offset costs of DSH payments, because the Commission has determined
that DSH payments generally do not reflect differences in costs.

The Health Security Act would reduce the DSH adjustment, because it would also reduce the number of uninsured and underinsured
patients. A smaller DSH adjustment would raise HCFA's estimate of the relationship between teaching intensity and
Medicare inpatient costs per case almost to the level of ProPAC's estimates. This change would not affect ProPAC's
estimates. Thus, a 3.0 percent adjustment is likely to be substantially lower than either HCFA's or ProPAC's estimate
of the empirical relationship between teaching intensity and Medicare inpatient costs per case.

ProPAC is concerned that the level of funding of the Academic Health Care Account and the formula for distributing
these funds are not based on objective analysis of the costs incurred by teaching hospitals in carrying out their functions.
(See Recommendation 3.) Therefore, the Commission believes Medicare can best carry out its responsibilities to
maintain access to quality care for Medicare beneficiaries and other patients by retaining the IME adjustment to
PPS payments until an alternative system of compensating appropriately for the higher costs of patient care in teaching
institutions is fully operational.

Changes in the IME adjustment should be considered in the context of its interactions with other components of the
payment system and its effects on PPS payments, as well as hospitals' overall financial status. The impact on the quality
of care and access to that care should also be considered. In general, any change in Medicare payment policy must be
considered in terms of its effect on the health care system as a whole.

In the coming year, ProPAC will continue to examine the level and structure of the IME adjustment, as well as other factors
that affect hospitals' payments, costs, and financial condition. The distribution of PPS and total margins and the
other effects of possible changes in the IME adjustment will be studied. The Commission will also examine the potential
effects on teaching hospitals of proposals in the Health Security Act. (See Recommendation 3.) A description of ProPAC's
most recent analyses is available in the Commission's technical report, 

Indirect Medical Education and Disproportionate Share Payment Adjustments to Hospitals (March 1994).



Recommendation 20: Prospective Payment Method for Outpatient Services



The Commission believes a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services should be implemented. Outpatient
payment reform should result in consistent policies across all sites and providers. Payment should be based on a prospective
price per unit of service until other methods can be developed that would appropriately control the volume of services.
The payment rate should be adjusted to reflect justifiable cost differences across settings.

The Commission supports congressional intent to establish prospective payment methods for hospital outpatient
services. These methods will create incentives for controlling costs by offering providers the opportunity for
a profit as well as the risk of financial loss. Such incentives are enhanced further as more services are bundled within
the rate. The current payment method for hospital-provided outpatient services contributes to both cost and charge
inflation. Because payments incorporate at least a portion of facility-specific costs or charges, hospitals that
reduce their costs receive less in payments. Thus, there is little financial incentive to deliver care more efficiently.

The Commission believes the method and unit of payment should be comparable across settings. This consistency is
necessary because the ambulatory services offered by hospitals are also furnished in other sites, such as free-standing
surgery centers and physician offices. Moreover, most ambulatory care is provided outside of hospital settings.
Additionally, the various payment methods and units that Medicare employs for ambulatory services encourage choosing
the site of service on the basis of financial rather than clinical considerations. Finally, the lack of payment comparability
across sites inhibits efforts to control overall health care expenditures.

Although the same method and unit should be used to determine payment to all providers of ambulatory services, the
payment rate may vary for different providers and across treatment sites. There are many reasons why costs may differ
among similar providers (such as teaching and non-teaching hospitals) and across treatment sites (such as hospitals
and physician offices). The Commission believes it is desirable to recognize in the payment system those factors
that represent a benefit to society and are beyond the control of the provider, such as the costs associated with medical
education. Further, these costs should be shared more broadly across the health care system to avoid financial discrimination
against teaching facilities.

Medicare should establish a prospective payment rate per unit of service based on methods currently used in other
settings. Such a system would go a long way toward improving the financial incentives to providers by rewarding efficiencies
in service provision and penalizing inefficiencies. ProPAC recognizes that such a system should be only an interim
measure, however, because it does not control the growth in volume of services. The Commission therefore recommends
that an outpatient prospective payment system be implemented as soon as possible to incorporate volume control measures.
The payment should move from a fee for an individual service to a larger payment unit containing more services. Such
