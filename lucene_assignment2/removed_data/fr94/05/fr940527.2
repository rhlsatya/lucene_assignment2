Rural Electrification Administration

Rescission of REA Bulletin



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of rescission of REA Bulletin on Joint Use of Facilities.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Rural Electrification (REA) hereby rescinds REA Bulletin 5-1, Joint Use of Facilities for Telephone and
Electric Service.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 20, 1993, at 58 FR 44288, in a proposed rule dealing with Long-Range Financial Forcasts of Electric Borrowers,
the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposed rescission of REA Bulletin 5-1, Joint Use of Facilities
for Electric and Telephone Service. This bulletin, issued in 1954, and last revised in 1972, deals with agreements
between REA electric and telephone borrowers for joint use of poles. The information in the bulletin is obsolete,
and REA believes guidance from REA in this area is unnecessary in today's technological and regulatory environment.




The original comment period on the proposal expired on September 20, 1993. In response to requests from the public
for more time to prepare responses to the proposed rule on Long-Range Financial Forecasts, REA published a document
in the 

Federal Register

 on September 20, 1993, at 58 FR 48800, extending the comment period through October 20, 1993. 

Only one comment was received on the proposal to rescind Bulletin 5-1. While agreeing that Bulletin 5-1
is no longer needed, the commentor asked about REA Bulletin 40-5, Common Use of Poles for Distribution and Transmission
Lines. Bulletin 40-5 was rescinded in December 1991, and this rescission was noted in the Index of Electric Issuances
issued by REA and mailed to all electric borrowers in October 1992. The commentor asked about the provisions in the
REA loan mortgage and loan documents concerning joint use. 

REA has begun a comprehensive project to consider revisions to the form and content of the REA mortgage and loan documents.
An advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject was published on December 2, 1991, at 56 FR 61201. Issues concerning
joint use will be addressed in the rulemaking proceeding to revise the mortgage. 

Therefore, REA hereby rescinds REA Bulletin 5-1, Joint Use of Facilities for Electric and Telephone Service.
A final rule on Long-Range Financial Forecasts of Electric Borrowers will be published at a later date.

Action Affecting Export Privileges; H. Leonard Berg



In the matter of: H. Leonard Berg, 750 Kappock Street, Apartment 103, Bronx, New York 10463 and currently incarcerated
at: U.S. Bureau of Prisons, Low Security Correctional Institution, Allenwood, White Deer, Pennsylvania 17887.



Order Denying Permission To Apply For or Use Export Licenses



On January 29, 1992, H. Leonard Berg (hereinafter referred to as ``Berg'') was convicted in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of New York of, among other crimes, four counts of violating the Arms Export Control Act (22
U.S.C.A. 2778 (1990, Supp. 1993)) (the ``AECA''), for exporting night vision devices to Argentina and the Soviet
Union and for exporting firearms and ammunition to Iraq and Poland, without obtaining the required licenses or written
approval from the U.S. Department of State. Section 11(h) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50
U.S.C.A. app.   2401-2420 (1991, Supp. 1993, and Public Law 103-10, March 27, 1993)) (the
``EAA''), provides that, at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce,
 no person convicted of violating the AECA, or certain other provisions of the United States Code, shall be eligible
to apply for or use any export license issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA or the Export Administration Regulations
(currently codified at 15 CFR parts 768-799 (1993)) (the ``Regulations''), for a period of up to 10 years from
the date of the conviction. In addition, any export license issued pursuant to the EAA in which such a person had any
interest at the time of his conviction may be revoked.





Pursuant to   770.15 and 772.1(g) of the Regulations, upon notification that a person has been convicted
of violating the AECA, the Director, Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Director, Office of Export
Enforcement, shall determine whether to deny that person permission to apply for or use any export license issued
pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations and shall also determine whether to revoke any export license
previously issued to such a person. Having received notice of Berg's conviction for violating the AECA, and following
consultations with the Director, Office of Export Enforcement, I have decided to deny Berg permission to apply for
or use any export license, including any general license, issued pursuant to, or provided by, the EAA and the Regulations,
for a period of 10 years from the date of his conviction. The 10-year period ends on January 29, 2002. I have also decided
to revoke all export licenses issued pursuant to the EAA in which Berg had an interest at the time of his conviction.

Accordingly, it is hereby Ordered

I. All outstanding individual validated licenses in which Berg appears or participates, in any manner of capacity,
are hereby revoked and shall be returned forthwith to the Office of Export Licensing for cancellation. Further, all
of Berg's privileges of participating, in any manner or capacity, in any special licensing procedure, including,
but not limited to, distribution licenses, are hereby revoked.

II. Until January 29, 2002, H. Leonard Berg, 750 Kappock Street, Apartment 103, Bronx, New York 10463, and currently
incarcerated at U.S. Bureau of Prisons, Low Security Correctional Institution_Allenwood, White Deer, Pennsylvania
17887, hereby is denied all privileges of participating, directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, in any
transaction in the United States or abroad involving any commodity or technical data exported or to be exported from
the United States, in whole or in part, and subject to the Regulations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
participation, either in the United States or abroad, shall include participation, directly or indirectly, in any
manner or capacity: (i) As a party or as a representative of a party to any export license application submitted to the
Department; (ii) in preparing or filing with the Department any export license application or request for reexport
authorization, or any document to be submitted therewith; (iii) in obtaining from the Department or using any validated
or general export license, reexport authorization or other export control document; (iv) in carrying on negotiations
with respect to, or in receiving, ordering, buying, selling, delivering, storing, using, or disposing of, in whole
or in part, any commodities or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States, and subject to the Regulations;
and (v) in financing, forwarding, transporting, or other servicing of such commodities or technical data.

III. After notice and opportunity for comment as provided in  770.15(h) of the Regulations, any person, firm,
corporation, or business organization related to Berg by affiliation, ownership, control, or position of responsibility
in the conduct of trade or related services may also be subject to the provisions of this Order.

IV. As provided in  787.12(a) of the Regulations, without prior disclosure of the facts to and specific authorization
of the Office of Export Licensing, in consultation with the Office of Export Enforcement, no person may directly or
indirectly, in any manner or capacity: (i) Apply for, obtain, or use any license, Shipper's Export Declaration, bill
of lading, or other export control document relating to an export or reexport of commodities or technical data by,
to, or for another person then subject to an order revoking or denying his export privileges or then excluded from practice
before the Bureau of Export Administration; or (ii) order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of, forward,
transport, finance, or otherwise service or participate: (a) in any transaction which may involve any commodity
or technical data exported or to be exported from the United States; (b) in any reexport thereof; or (c) in any other
transaction which is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, if the person denied export privileges may
obtain any benefit or have any interest in, directly or indirectly, any of these transactions.

V. This Order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until January 29, 2002.

VI. A copy of this Order shall be delivered to H. Leonard Berg. This Order shall be published in the 

Federal Register

On February 25, 1994, Oxidor requested an extension of time in which to respond to the Department's Section A, B, and
C deficiency letter. On February 25, 1994, we granted the extension.

On March 2, 1994, petitioners submitted an allegation of sales below COP using company-specific data previously
reported by Oxidor.

On March 10, 1994, we published, in the 

Federal Register

, a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than May 20, 1994, pursuant
to petitioners' request.

On March 11, 1994, Oxidor submitted comments concerning petitioners' request for a COP investigation. On March 14,
1994, petitioners submitted a response to Oxidor's comments concerning the COP allegation.

On March 15, 1994, we received Oxidor's Sections A, B, and C deficiency response. On March 16, 1994, Oxidor submitted
corrections to its deficiency response.

On March 17, 1994, Oxidor submitted further comments concerning petitioners' COP allegation. On March 28, 1994,
petitioners responded to Oxidor's March 17, 1994 submission. On April 5, 1994, we initiated a COP investigation.
On April 6, 1994, we issued a Section D questionnaire to Oxidor. On May 4, 1994, Oxidor requested an extension of time
to respond to Section D of the questionnaire. On May 6, 1994, we granted the extension. On May 10, 1994, Oxidor submitted
its response to Section D of the questionnaire.



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether sales of PA from Venezuela to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the
United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.



United States Price



For sales by Oxidor directly from Venezuela to the United States, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with
section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior
to importation and because exporter's sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated.

We calculated purchase price based on packed prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A)
of the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, foreign
brokerage and handling (which Oxidor reported as commission expenses), ocean freight and other miscellaneous handling
fees.

We made an adjustment to USP for the tax paid on the comparison sales in Venezuela. In this investigation, there is one
tax, the Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), which is a value-added tax (VAT), levied on sales of the subject merchandise
in the home market, beginning on October 1, 1993. Sales invoiced prior to October 1, 1993, are not subject to the IVA.
The IVA is a fixed percentage rate tax of ten percent of the gross unit price. We have only performed the tax calculations
on U.S. sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993, compared to home market sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993.
(See ``Concurrence Memorandum: Preliminary Determination in the Antidumping Duty Investigation of Phthalic Anhydride
from Venezuela,'' dated May 17, 1994, on file in room B-099 of the main Commerce Department Building, 14th and
Constitution, NW., Washington, DC 20230.)

On October 7, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v.

 United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise
at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. 

Federal-Mogul, 

Slip Op. 93-194 at 12.

The Department has changed its methodology in accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul 

decision, and has applied this new methodology in making the preliminary determination in this investigation. We
have added to USP the product of the foreign market tax rate and the price of the United States merchandise at the same
point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. We have also deducted
from the USP and the FMV those portions of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment attributable to expenses
included in the foreign market and United States bases of the tax if those expenses are later deducted to calculate
FMV and USP. These adjustments to the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the methodology
for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes
were levied upon foreign market sales.

This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still
reflect the inclusion of these expenses in the bases. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between USP and FMV, but is the result of the price of the United States merchandise containing greater expenses than
the price of the foreign market merchandise. This adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance
with the United States Court of Appeals' holding that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v.

 United States, 

988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. 

v.

 United States, 

760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo

.



Foreign Market Value



In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of PA in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of PA to the volume of third country sales of PA in accordance with section
773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determine that Oxidor had a viable home market with respect to
sales of PA during the POI.

Petitioners alleged that Oxidor was selling in the home market at prices below COP. Based on petitioners' allegation,
we initiated a COP investigation, and requested data on Oxidor's production costs. Oxidor's cost data was not submitted
in time to be considered for the preliminary determination. However, Oxidor's submitted cost data will be examined
at verification and will be analyzed for purposes of our final determination.

In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we compared U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level of trade, where possible.

We calculated FMV based on packed ex-factory prices charged to related and unrelated customers in the home market.
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we included arm's-length sales to related customers, pursuant to
19 CFR 353.45.

In light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v.

 United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges
from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead will adjust for those
expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision
of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate.

Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight and inland insurance. Pursuant to
19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, were appropriate, for differences in credit expenses
and warehousing expenses.

We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.

As discussed above, the IVA was only levied on sales in the home market invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. Therefore,
we calculated two FMVs, one covering the period May-September, 1993, and one covering October, 1993, of the
POI, to account for the application of the IVA tax only on sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. See ``Concurrence
Memorandum'' for further details. We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price
deductions in the original tax base (

i.e.,

 the sum of any amounts that were deducted from the tax base). This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions
and deductions had been made. By making the additional tax adjustments, we avoid a distortion that would create a dumping
margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero.



Currency Conversion



Because certified exchange rates from the Federal Reserve were unavailable, we made currency conversions based
on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the International Monetary
Fund. Oxidor has requested that we use a currency conversion methodology different from the Department's normal
practice given the sustained increase in the bolivar/U.S. dollar exchange rate during the POI. We have disallowed
Oxidor's alternate currency conversion methodologies as Oxidor has not met the requirements of currency conversion
using the ``Special Rule'' in 19 CFR 353.60(b). See ``Concurrence Memorandum'' for further details.



 Verification



As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of phthalic anhydride from Venezuela, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice,
that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice in
the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping
margins, as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average
dumping margins are as follows:






ITC Notification



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry, before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination.

 Addition to the procurement list.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List service to be 
furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or 
have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On March 25, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (59 FR 14154) of 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 



Comments were received from the current contractor for this 
service, which indicated that the loss of the contract would have 
an adverse impact on the company. The percentage of the 
contractor's total sales which this contract represents, however, 
is not large enough by itself to constitute severe adverse impact 
as the Committee views contractor impact. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the service, 
fair market price, and impact of the addition on the current or 



most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the 
service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal 
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the service 
to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the service. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the service to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the service proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 

Accordingly, the following service is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 




Janitorial/Custodial, 
Charles E. Chamberlain Federal Building, 
315 W. Allegan, 
Lansing, Michigan. 






This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of the Finding of No Significant Impact for the Proposed Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
Initial Development Program Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DOD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the
National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR parts 1500-1508), Department of Defense Directive 6050.1, and Army
Regulation 200-2, the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command was tasked to conduct an assessment of potential
environmental consequences of the THAAD Initial Development Program in support of the Theater Missile Defense (TMD)
Initiative. A no-action alternative was also considered. The Program Executive Office, Missile Defense, has the
responsibility for conducting the THAAD program, which is intended to demonstrate a high-altitude interceptor
missile system.


The THAAD program activities would include development and flight testing of the THAAD interceptor missile system
against ballistic and maneuvering targets. Some targets could carry a chemical simulant payload to quantify THAAD
lethality against chemical warheads.
This EA and the decision it supports cover the first two demonstration flight test scheduled to be conducted at White
Sands Missile Range (WSMR), New Mexico, beginning in late 1994. The THAAD EA also analyzes the construction of a target
launch complex for the THAAD program in the Firing-In-Extension area north of WSMR. The remaining 18 flight tests
involving missile intercepts of government-furnished target missiles will be covered in supplemental environmental
documentation as information becomes available. All of the proposed locations were selected based on their ongoing
work for similar programs and/or as a result of the competitive procurement process.
Development and test activities for the THAAD program would be conducted at WSMR; Arnold Engineering and Development
Center, Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee; Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico; Lyndon B. Johnson Test Center, WSMR;
Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Incorporated, Courtland, Alabama, and Santa Cruz and Sunnyvale, California;
Naval Surface Warfare Center, White Oak, Maryland; Phillips Laboratory, Edwards Air Force Base, California; Rockwell
International Corporation, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, California; United Technologies Corporation,
Chemical Systems Division, San Jose, California; and Stanford Research Institute, Tracy, California. most THAAD
program activities are considered routine for proposed test locations and would use mostly existing personnel.
Alternatives to this proposed system to be analyzed are:
 Alternative test ranges.
 Alternative interceptor launch locations.
 Alternative target launch locations.
 Alternative materials and manufacturing processes.
 Conducting THAAD intercept testing against targets without chemical simulant payloads.
 No-action alternative in which the TMD program would continue to be developed without the ability of the THAAD
program to intercept and destroy high-altitude enemy tactical missiles.



FINDINGS: 

To assess the significance of potential environmental impacts, a list of the site-specific activities necessary
to accomplish the proposed action was first developed. The affected environment at all THAAD program activity locations
was then described. Next, those activities with the potential for causing environmental impacts were identified.
Each of these identified activities was subsequently evaluated in greater detail. Eleven broad environmental issue
components were evaluated to provide a context for understanding the potential effects of the proposed action and
to provide a basis for assessing the significance of potential impacts. The 11 areas of environmental consideration
are air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, hazardous materials and waste, health and safety, infrastructure,
land use, noise, physical resources, socioeconomics, and water resources. If a proposed activity was determined
to present a potential for environmental impact, then the activity was evaluated by considering the intensity, extent,
and context in which the impact would occur. As a result of the evaluation, impacts were assigned to one of three categories:
No impact, not significant impact, or significant impact.


Evaluation of the areas of environmental consideration for which a potential for impact was posed has shown that no
significant impacts would occur from implementation of the THAAD Initial Development program activities at any
of the proposed locations. The environmental consequences of all planned THAAD program activities evaluated were
determined to be not significant for all locations.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award: Corwin R. Horton </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a discretionary financial
assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under
Grant Number DE-FG01-94CE15546 to Corwin R. Horton. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated
amount of $99,900 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of ``The Hyperdynamic
Hull''.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for
financial assistance submitted by Corwin R. Horton is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10
CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance
under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The market potential for this invention includes the recreational/pleasure
boat industry, which generated sales in 1992 of $10 billion (456,000 units). Exports generate a large portion of sales
for this industry. The growing ferry industry, U.S. Coast Guard and military represent other markets. The invention
should significantly improve fuel economy and handling, compared to existing hulls. By reducing drag (friction)
on a vessel's hull, the invention reduces energy consumption by an estimated 35 percent. The principal investigator
and inventor Dr. Harry Stanford has a patent on his invention and wide experience in developing the new technology.
The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because
the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975
to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support
for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.




The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 18 months from the date of award.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a discretionary financial
assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under
Grant Number DE-FG01-94CE15596 to Microdin Design, Inc. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated
amount of $91,811 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of an energy-efficient
device and system for drying green veneer sheets. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for
financial assistance submitted by Michael E. Christian is meritorious based on the general evaluation required
by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance
under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The market potential for this invention amounts to approximately
150 softwood veneer mills plus hundreds of small companies producing hardwood veneer. Lay-up mills, which manufacture
veneer into plywood, represent an additional market. The invention conserves energy by using lower temperatures,
desiccated air, and through the absence of pollution control equipment, such as electrostatic precipitators. The
energy saving potential of this technology exceeds 50 percent. The principal investigator and inventor Michael
Christian, currently the President of Microdin Designs, Inc., has experience as legislative consultant and college
instructor and training in psychology, for which his B.S. was given, with graduate work in environmental psychology.
In addition he is a skilled programmer. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent,
current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been
structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation
directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans
to issue a competitive solicitation. 



The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 24 months from the date of award.

Alabama Power Company; Availability of Environmental Assessment



 May 23, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has revised
the application for Martin Dam Project, located on the Tallapoosa River, in Elmore, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Counties,
Alabama, and has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposed revised recreation plan. The Commission
staff concluded that approval of the application for the revised recreation plan, would not constitute a major Federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426. 

Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Any comments, conclusions, or recommendations
that draw upon studies, reports, or other working papers of substance should be supported by appropriate documentation.

Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project No. 349-029 to all comments. For further information,

<DOCTITLE>Central Vermont Public Service Corporation; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



May 23, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the applications for subsequent license for the constructed and operating Pierce Mills, Arnold Falls, Gage, and
Passumpsic projects, located on the Passumpsic River in Caledonia County, Vermont, and has prepared a Draft Environmental
Assessment (DEA) for the four projects.

In the DEA, the Commission's staff evaluates the potential environmental impacts that would result from the continued
operation of the projects and concludes that relicensing the projects with appropriate enhancement measures would
not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the data of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project
No. 2608 to all comments.

<DOCTITLE>Mr. Thomas Hohman; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



May 23, 1994.




In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a minor license for the proposed Barberville Hydroelectric Project located on Poestenkill Creek
in Rensselaer, near Poestenkill, New York, and prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed project.

On September 23, 1993, a draft EA was issued, distributed to all parties, and noticed for public comment. Comments
were requested on the draft EA to be filed within 45 days. Per the applicant's request, the comment period was extended
to November 15, 1993. All comments that were filed have been considered in the final EA. Comments on the draft EA did
not warrant change to staff conclusions or recommendations.

In the final EA, the Commission staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project and
has concluded that regardless of our recommended mitigative measures, construction and operation impacts of the
Barberville Project would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the visual character of the area and would have an
unavoidable adverse effect on the recreational experience of visitors to the area. Based on these unavoidable adverse
effects and the marginal economic status of the proposed project, the staff recommends that the license be denied.
Denial of the proposed project would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of
the human environment.

Copies of the final EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices
at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for CIG to appear or be represented
at the hearing.

Eastern filed tariff sheets as part of its General Terms and Conditions to clarify that certain incremental services
are not subject to the ASA provision and to further clarify the definition of ``Applicable Shrinkage Percentages''.
In addition, Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT and VKIT were eliminated from the listing of ASA Rate Schedules. The Commission's
March 16, 1994 Order in Docket No. RP94-135-000 rejected as premature, those sheets in the February 14
filing reflecting the above-mentioned clarifications.

Texas Eastern states that on January 31, 1994, Texas Eastern filed a comprehensive stipulation and agreement in the
above-referenced dockets to resolve all of Texas Eastern's Order No. 636 transition costs issues and an array of related
issues in numerous separate ongoing proceedings of which Docket No. RP94-135-000 is included (Settlement).
Pursuant to Ordering Paragraph (C) of the May 12 Order approving the Settlement, Texas Eastern hereby submits these
sheets to reflect the identical clarifications as set forth in the February 14 filing.

Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with  385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
All such protests should be filed on or before May 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining
the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this
filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review



<AGENCY>

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.),

 this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection
and its expected cost and burden; where appropriate, it includes the actual data collection instrument.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response






Title:

 Vendor Information Systems for Innovative Treatment Technologies (VISITT) and for Innovative Measurement and
Monitoring Technologies (VISIMMT) (EPA ICR 

#

 1583.02). This ICR requests renewal of a currently approved collection (OMB 

#

2050-0114).



Abstract:

 The Technology Innovative Office (TIO) of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) is planning to
continue a voluntary and ongoing collection of data on innovative treatment technologies to clean up contaminated
waste sites. In addition, the Agency will be expanding the data collection effort to include information on innovative
measurement and monitoring technologies for contaminated waste sites. Specifically, TIO will request information
concerning technologies to treat soil, sludge, solids, sediments and ground water in situ. Widely available technologies
(i.e., incineration, solidification/stabilization, and ex situ aqueous treatment) have been excluded.

The vendor surveys will collect both general company information and technology-specific data. The company information
includes name, address, phone numbers, and contact names. Technology data includes technology name, developmental
status, media/wastes treated, contaminants and concentration ranges treated, waste limitations, factors affecting
performance, summary performance data, range of unit costs, factors influencing cost, available hardware and capacity,
treatability study capabilities, permits obtained, clients and references.

TIO plans to use the treatment and monitoring developers and vendors to serve as an avenue for technology developers
and vendors to inform potential users of their capabilities, and to give site cleanup professionals the ability to
assess new technologies for applicability to specific sites. Spurring private investment in the development and
commercialization of new treatment technologies is also a major concern.



Burden Statement:

 The estimated public reporting burden for this collection of information is broken out into one of three possible
reporting options: first, for those that are submitting the vendor form for the first time, 25 hours are estimated
for each report submitted; second, for those returning updated reports, an estimated 13 hours per update report will
be required; finally EPA has estimated that a certain number of those receiving forms will take 1 hour to read the material
and then decide not to participate in the vendor program. These estimates include time to read the instructions, gather
existing information, and prepare and submit the form. There are no recordkeeping requirements.



Respondents:

 Entities or individuals developing or commercializing new treatment or monitoring technologies for contaminated
site cleanup including individuals/entrepreneurs, remedial contractors, and commercial hazardous or solid waste
treaters.



Estimated No. of Respondents:

 478.



Estimated No. of Responses Per Respondent:

 2.



Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 12,000 hours.



Frequency of Collection:

 Annual.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions
for reducing the burden, to:

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency announces the availability of a memorandum setting out EPA's policy on the application
of the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) dilution prohibition to the combustion of inorganic metal-bearing hazardous
wastes. Under the existing LDR dilution prohibition, burning inorganic metal-bearing hazardous wastes can be a
form of impermissible dilution. The Agency believes it is appropriate to make this information available to the public
to emphasize that in individual cases and according to specific circumstances, burning inorganic metal-bearing
hazardous wastes may constitute a violation of the LDR dilution prohibition.

<DOCTITLE>Certain Chemicals; Approval of Test Marketing Exemptions </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces EPA's approval of an application for test marketing exemptions (TMEs) under section 5(h)(1)
of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 40 CFR 720.38. EPA has designated this application as TME-94-12
and TME-94-13. The test marketing conditions are described below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 5(h)(1) of TSCA authorizes EPA to exempt persons from premanufacture notification (PMN) requirements and
permit them to manufacture or import new chemical substances for test marketing purposes if the Agency finds that
the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substances for test marketing purposes
will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. EPA may impose restrictions on
test marketing activities and may modify or revoke a test marketing exemption upon receipt of new information which
casts significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activity will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.


EPA hereby approves TME-94-12 and TME-94-13. EPA has determined that test marketing of the
new chemical substance described below, under the conditions set out in the TME application, and for the time period
and restrictions specified below, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.
Production volume, use, and the number of customers must not exceed that specified in the application. All other conditions
and restrictions described in the application and in this notice must be met. 
Inadvertently the notice of receipt of the application was not published. Therefore, an opportunity to submit comments
is being offered at this time. The complete nonconfidential document is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information
Center (NCIC), Rm. B-607 Northeast Mall, at the above address between 12 noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding legal holidays. EPA may modify or revoke the test marketing exemptions if comments are received which cast
significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury.
The following additional restrictions apply to TME-94-12 and TME-94-13. A bill of lading
accompanying each shipment must state that the use of the substance is restricted to that approved in the TME. In addition,
the applicant shall maintain the following records until 5 years after the date they are created, and shall make them
available for inspection or copying in accordance with section 11 of TSCA:
1.  Records of the quantity of the TME substance produced and the date of manufacture. 
2.  Records of dates of the shipments to each customer and the quantities supplied in each shipment.
3.  Copies of the bill of lading that accompanies each shipment of the TME substance.

The Agency reserves the right to rescind approval or modify the conditions and restrictions of an exemption should
any new information that comes to its attention cast significant doubt on its finding that the test marketing activities
will not present any unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.

Analysis of Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from
respondents Amoco Chemical Company and Amoco Foam Products Company, Delaware corporations.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order.

This matter concerns the labeling and advertising of Amoco polystyrene cups, plates and other food service products.
The Commission's complaint in this matter alleges that Amoco falsely represented that the polystyrene cups, plates
and other food service products are recyclable. In fact, the complaint alleges, the polystyrene food service products
are not recyclable because there are only a few collection facilities nationwide that will accept them for recycling.

The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents
from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future.

Part I of the proposed order requires that respondents cease and desist from misrepresenting, in any manner, directly
or by implication, with respect to any polystyrene food service product or packaging material the extent to which
it is capable of being recycled or to which recycling collection programs are available.

Part II of the proposed order provides that if the respondents represent in advertising or labeling that any plastic
food service product or packaging material offers any environmental benefit, they must have a reasonable basis consisting
of competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence,
that substantiates the claims.

The proposed order also requires respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered
by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes
in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance
with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

FY 1994 Epidemiologic Research Studies of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) Infection 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces a program for competitive fiscal year (FY) 1994 cooperative
agreement applications to conduct epidemiologic research studies of AIDS and HIV infection. These studies will
evaluate the impact of existing program services on the psychological adjustment and transition to new living situations
among children whose mothers are in the terminal stage of AIDS or have died of AIDS. The study of this research issue
as it pertains to minority populations (defined as one of the four federally-recognized groups: Black, Hispanic,
Asian and Pacific Islander, and Native American) is encouraged because minorities constitute over 49 percent of
all reported cases of AIDS and approximately 75 percent of all women and children with AIDS. 

Research has suggested that by the end of the decade more than 80,000 children and adolescents will be motherless due
to AIDS. Not since the influenza epidemic of 1918 has this country been faced with this large a number of motherless
children. Cities expected to be the most affected include Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New York City, Washington,
DC, and San Juan, P.R. However, the problem extends far beyond these pediatric HIV epicenters. More than 40 percent
of the motherless children are anticipated in other cities as well as suburban and rural areas. In 1992 nearly 7,000
children were born to HIV-infected women; 3,000 of these were born in the southeastern United States. 

It is currently expected that all children born to HIV-infected mothers will be left motherless. To place the magnitude
of this problem in context, cancer kills the mothers of 4,200 children and 8,700 adolescents each year. Motor vehicle
accidents annually kill the mothers of 3,200 children and 1,900 adolescents. In 1994 AIDS will leave 3,900 children
and 3,400 adolescents motherless. 

The impact of these deaths will be experienced on both the institutional and personal levels. Programs for children
of HIV-infected mothers will require large social welfare expenditures in the coming decades. And yet, little research
has been completed to demonstrate the essential and effective social-service components that will be required,
particularly for families with HIV-infected members. It is anticipated that programs for children and their caregivers
should include mental health and bereavement counseling, programs that bridge the transition from AIDS-specific
entitlement and services to general programs, housing support in the larger cities, and school/community programs
to help reduce high-risk behaviors in coming generations. In the face of the problems of exponential growth and diminishing
funds, research should be conducted which determines the critical elements of a successful program. 

On the personal level, recently initiated behavioral studies have begun to highlight the impact of HIV infection
on mothers and their children. Studies have emphasized both the stigma associated with HIV infection and the important
role children play in decisions made by infected mothers. Evidence has suggested that mothers fear disclosing their
HIV infection to their children, and because of this, often delay seeking much needed health care for themselves.
Because of anticipated stigma, families may withdraw socially, attempting to cope without help from outside the
family. Mothers also delay making plans for the care of their children after their death so that children may be placed
in temporary foster care for many months during a period of considerable emotional stress to the child and family.
Finally, there is preliminary evidence that teenaged children of HIV-infected mothers may engage in HIV-related
sexual and drug-using behaviors in the period following the mother's death, behaviors attributed in part to the emotional
trauma experienced by the adolescents during the transition period. Transitional social service programs for younger
children at the time of their mother's death may in effect serve as primary prevention programs by helping children
more effectively adjust to a new living situation and cope with the loss of their mother. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy 
People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This
announcement is related to the priority area of HIV infection. (To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the

Approximately $250,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund approximately two awards. It is expected that the average
award will be approximately $125,000. Awards will begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for 12-month
budget periods within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation
awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory programmatic progress and the availability
of funds. 



Purpose
 


The purpose of these awards is to help support researchers in the study of important HIV-related epidemiologic issues
and specifically to evaluate the impact of HIV program services on the psychological adjustment and transition to
new living situations among children (ages 5-12) whose mothers are in the terminal stage of AIDS or have died
of AIDS. Programs which examine this research issue as it affects minority populations are of special interest. 



Program Requirements 



Research Issues 



One research issue of programmatic interest to the health care community and to CDC for FY 1994 is described below and
is considered to be of significant importance in gaining a greater understanding of the epidemiology of AIDS and HIV
infection. However, applications submitted by organizations that examine other important HIV-related epidemiologic
research issues will also be accepted and considered for funding. 

Study proposals are solicited that address issues related to the impact of the terminal illness and death of the HIV-infected
mother upon the child by evaluating services available to families before, during, and after the mother's death.
Specifically, proposals are sought which will describe methods to identify and evaluate those interventions which
are necessary and effective in promoting the child's healthy, psychological adjustment as well as transition to
their new living situation. The transition period of specific interest includes the periods immediately prior to
and after the mother's death. The evaluation component must include both process and outcome evaluations and descriptions
of how the researchers will access children with HIV-infected mothers and follow them after the mother's death. Preference
will be given to proposals that evaluate two or more existing transitional programs sponsored by State or local governmental
agencies or community-based organizations and include a minimum of 125 children (ages 5-12) per program. Applicants
are also encouraged to submit proposals that compare different types of transitional programs. 

Examples of worthwhile proposals include: Limited, longitudinal studies of children enrolled in foster care or
other transitional programs specifically for families of HIV-infected mothers. Research strategies may include,
but need not be limited to, record reviews to document numbers and types of foster or other caretaking arrangements
of the child, placement of siblings, quantitative interviews with caretakers, and psychological measures including
measures of bereavement, anxiety and depression, etc. Applicants must document specific behavioral research and
evaluation expertise among the proposed staff. Applicants must also be willing to participate collaboratively
with CDC and other researchers in the development, implementation, and analysis of data from the proposed study.




Cooperative Agreements 



A cooperative agreement indicates that CDC will assist the collaborator in conducting the epidemiologic research
of AIDS and HIV infection described in the PURPOSE section of this announcement. The application should be presented
in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the research problem in a collaborative manner with

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice extends the comment period for the Disability Reengineering Project Proposal published April 15, 1994

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Disability Process Reengineering Team of the Social Security Administration (SSA) published a notice on April
15, 1994 (59 FR 18188) that announced a proposal to redesign the disability
 claims process for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income Disability and Blindness
benefits. This notice provided for a comment period that ended May 27, 1994. Although the Proposal was available to
the employees of SSA and State Disability Determination Services on April 1, it was not widely available to members
of the general public until the April 15 publication in the 

Federal Register

. Due to the importance of these issues, we believe a longer comment period is appropriate. Therefore, we are extending
the comment period to June 14, 1994. The comments will be weighed in the Agency's subsequent decisions on implementation.

<DOCTITLE>Finding Regarding Foreign Social Insurance or Pension System; Republic of Yemen </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration, HHS.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of finding regarding foreign social insurance or pension system_republic of Yemen.

 



FINDING:

 Section 202(t)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(1)) prohibits payment of monthly benefits to any individual
who is not a United States citizen or national for any month after he or she has been outside the United States for 6 consecutive
months. This prohibition does not apply to such an individual where one of the exceptions described in section 202(t)(2)
through 202(t)(5) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2) through 402(t)(5)) affects his or her case. 



Section 202(t)(2) of the Social Security Act provides that, subject to certain residency requirements of section
202(t)(11), the prohibition against payment shall not apply to any individual who is a citizen of a country which the
Secretary of Health and Human Services finds has in effect a social insurance or pension system which is of general
application in such country and which: 

(a) Pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death; and


(b) Permits individuals who are United States citizens but not citizens of that country and who qualify for such benefits
to receive those benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, while outside the foreign country regardless of
the duration of the absence. 

The Secretary of Health and Human Services has delegated the authority to make such a finding to the Commissioner of
Social Security. The Commissioner has redelegated that authority to the Director of the Office of International
Policy. Under that authority the Director of the Office of International Policy has approved a finding that the Republic
of Yemen, beginning June 9, 1992, does not have a social insurance or pension system of general application in effect
which pays periodic benefits, or the actuarial equivalent thereof, on account of old age, retirement, or death. 

Accordingly, it is hereby determined and found that the Republic of Yemen does not have in effect, beginning June 9,
1992, a social insurance or pension system which meets the requirements of section 202(t)(2)(A) of the Social Security
Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(2)(A)). 

This finding is also relevant regarding the application of subparagraph (A) and (B) of section 202(t)(4) of the Social
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(t)(4) (A) and (B)). That section provides that, subject to certain residency requirements
of section 202(t)(11), section 202(t)(1) shall not be applicable to benefits payable on the earnings record of an
individual who has not less than 40 quarters of coverage under Social Security or who has resided in the United States
for a period or periods aggregating 10 years or more. However, the provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section
202(t)(4) shall not apply to an individual who is a citizen of a foreign country that has in effect a social insurance
or pension system which is of general application in such country and which satisfies the provisions of subparagraph
(A) of section 202(t)(2) but not the provisions of subparagraph (B) of section 202(t)(2). 

In accordance with the finding herein, the limitation on payment of monthly benefits to aliens included in section
202(t)(1) does not apply to citizens of the Republic of Yemen receiving benefits on the earnings records of individuals
who have not less than 40 quarters of coverage under Social Security or who have resided in the United States for a period
or periods aggregating 10 years or more.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice announces that the amount of funds made 
available for implementation grants for the HOPE 1 under the NOFA 
published August 2, 1993 was increased by $1,087,628 using HOPE 1 
funds previously awarded for planning and implementation grants 
in FY 1992 that either were not obligated or were deobligated. 
In addition, HUD is announcing through this Notice that it 
extended the deadline for submission of responses to deficiency 
letters in the HOPE 1 program for those applicants located within 
the jurisdiction of HUD's former Region Three (since renamed the 
Mid-Atlantic Region) who were adversely affected in their 
preparation of responses to deficiency letters as a result of the 
extraordinarily severe winter weather and consequent office 
closings during the period January 14-28, 1994. Finally, in 
accordance with section 102(a)(4)(C) of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, this Notice announces 
the funding award decisions made by the Department for the HOPE 1 
program. The announcement contains the names and addresses of 
the award winners and the amount of the awards. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



The HOPE 1 program is authorized by title III of the U.S. 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437aaa), which was added by 
section 411 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing 
Act (Pub. L. 101-625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA). The 
law was subsequently amended by the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 
1992) (1992 Act). 

On August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41126), the Department published a 
NOFA announcing the availability of $182,047,160 in funding for 
implementation grants for the HOPE for Public and Indian Housing 
Homeownership Program (HOPE 1). On September 1, 1993 (58 FR 
46209), the Department published an amendment to the NOFA 
increasing the funding being made available by $24,000,000 from 
$182,047,160 to $206,047,160 due to the conclusion of the 
processing of a reprogramming request. The funds were 
appropriated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing 
and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation 
Acts for fiscal year 1992 (Pub. L. 102-139, approved October 28, 
1991) and fiscal year 1993 (Pub. L. 102-389, approved October 6, 
1992). In its Fiscal Year 1994 appropriations bill for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Congress rescinded 
$45,000,000 from the amounts remaining available for the HOPE 1 
program under the Department's fiscal year 1992 appropriation 
(Pub. L. 102-139) and $130,000,000 from the amounts remaining 
available under the Department's fiscal year 1993 appropriation 
(Pub. L. 102-389) for a total rescission of $175,000,000 in the 
amount of funds made available under the previously published 
NOFA and amendment. After the rescission, $31,047,160 remained 
to fund applications pursuant to the NOFA. 

On April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17560), the Department published a 
Notice of award based on procedural error announcing the award of 
$24,882,854 to the New Community Corporation in Newark, New 
Jersey based on a procedural error. The Department allocated 
$9,692,854 of the $31,047,160 available under the NOFA to 
partially fund the New Community Corporation application. The 
remainder of the New Community Corporation application was funded 
using amounts appropriated in 1994. After the award 
announcement, $21,354,306 remained available to fund applications 
pursuant to the NOFA. 

This Notice announces that the amount of funds remaining 
available for implementation grants for the HOPE 1 under the NOFA 
was increased from $21,354,306 by $1,087,628 using HOPE 1 funds 
previously awarded for planning and implementation grants in FY 
1992 that either were not obligated or were deobligated. After 
taking all of the adjustments into account, the total amount 
available for funding the grants announced by this Notice was 
$22,441,934. 

This Notice also announces that HUD extended the deadline 
for submission of responses to deficiency letters in the HOPE 1 
program for those applicants located within the jurisdiction of 
HUD's former Region Three (since renamed the Mid-Atlantic Region) 
who were adversely affected in their preparation of responses to 
deficiency letters as a result of the extraordinarily severe 
winter weather and consequent office closings during the period 
January 14-28, 1994. For qualified applicants, the deadline for 
submitting responses to deficiency letters was extended from 
January 28 to February 4, 1994. 

In order to qualify for an extension of the deadline for 
submitting a response to a deficiency letter for Implementation 
Grants under the HOPE 1 program, the following requirements had 
to have been met: 

(A) The applicant must have submitted a certification with 
its response to its deficiency letter describing the reasons 
which justify a delayed submission pursuant to this Notice; and 

(B) HUD must have determined that the certification 
adequately demonstrated that the applicant's ability to prepare 
or submit the required response to a deficiency letter was 
substantially impaired as a result of the extraordinarily severe 
winter weather and consequent office closings during the period 
January 14-28, 1994. Once HUD approved the certification, the 
application would be accepted for review. 

Only one applicant requested an extension of the deadline 
for responding to deficiency letters and complied with the 
requirements: The Housing Authority of the County of Chester in 
Pennsylvania. HUD accepted the Housing Authority of the County 
of Chester's deficiency response and continued to process its

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974_Alteration of Notice of System of Records</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department
of the Interior proposes to alter a notice describing a Departmentwide system of records managed by the Office of Aircraft
Services to expand one category of records included in the system, to add one additional category of individuals covered
by the system, and to add one new use of the records in the system. The notice being altered, which is published in its
entirety below, is ``Federal and Non-Federal Aviation Personnel, Equipment and Mishap Information System_Interior,
DOI-07,'' previously published on March 8, 1984 (49 FR 8680) as ``Aircraft Crew/Mechanic Information File_Interior,
Office of the Secretary-7.''

The category of records proposed for expansion in DOI-07 is accident experience data. Added to information
obtained in investigations of aircraft accidents is data reported involving aircraft incidents, aviation hazards,
and aircraft maintenance deficiencies.

The additional category of individuals covered by the system proposed for DOI-07 is pilots, aircrews, and ground
personnel of cooperating government agencies, organizations and private individuals.

The new use of system records proposed for DOI-07 allows for aircraft mishap trend analysis and for development
of statistical data for use in the Interior Aircraft Accident Prevention Program.

In DOI-07, the existing system name is revised to more adequately convey the Departmentwide extent of the scope-of-system
coverage.

All other changes proposed for DOI-07 are editorial in nature, clarify and update existing statements, and
reflect organizational, address and other miscellaneous administrative revisions which have occurred since the
previous publication of the material in the 

Federal Register

: To wit, the existing storage statement is revised to more accurately describe the current method of data storage;
the existing retrievability statement is revised to reflect current indexing capabilities; the existing retention
and disposal statement is revised to account for the disposition of records proposed for inclusion in the system;
the existing system record source categories statement is revised to more clearly identify current sources of system
data; and the existing location statement and existing system manager(s) and address statements are revised to reflect
changes in addresses of system managers.

As required by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)), the Office of Management and Budget, the Senate
Committee on Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Operations have been given notice of this
proposed alteration.

5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11) requires that the public be provided a 30-day period in which to comment on the new, intended uses
of the information in this system of records. The Office of Management and Budget, in its Circular A-130, requires
a 40-day period in which to review such proposals. Written comments on this proposal can be addressed to the Departmental
Privacy Act Officer, Office of the Secretary, Office of Administrative Services, 1849 ``C'' Street NW., Mail Stop
5412 MIB, Washington, DC 20240, telephone (202) 208-6045. Comments received within 40 days of publication
in the 

Federal Register

 will be considered. The notice shall be effective as proposed at the end of the comment period, unless comments are
received which would require a contrary determination.

all applicable regulations of the Secretary of the Interior, and to the following reservations to the United States:

1. A right-of-way thereon for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States. Act of August 30,
1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).

2. All minerals shall be reserved to the United States, together with the right to prospect for, mine and remove such
deposits from the same under applicable law and such regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe; and
will be subject to:

1. Those rights for water main purposes which have been granted to Las Vegas Valley Water District by Permit No. N-55369
under the Act of October 21, 1976.

2. Those rights for highway purposes which have been granted to the Nevada Department of Transportation by Permit
No. CC-018138 under the Act of November 9, 1921.

3. Those rights for highway purposes which have been granted to the Nevada Department of Transportation by Permit
No. N-46063 under the Act of August 27, 1958.

for the City of Las Vegas.

Detailed information concerning this action is available for review at the Bureau of Land Management Las Vegas District
Office, 4765 W. Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada.

Upon publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register,

 the segregations imposed by N-37122 and N-44642 on the land described above are terminated. The notice
of realty action for N-56125 reinstitutes a segregative effect on the land; therefore, the 40 acre parcel will
remain segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining laws, but not the
Recreation and Public Purposes Act, the mineral leasing laws, or disposal of mineral materials.

For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, interested parties may submit comments regarding the proposed lease/conveyance or classification of the land
to the BLM District Manager, Las Vegas District, P.O. Box 26569, Las Vegas, Nevada 89126. Any adverse comments will
be reviewed by the State Director.




CLASSIFICATION COMMENTS:

 Interested parties may submit comments involving the suitability of the land for a Good Shepard Campus. Comments
on the classification are restricted to whether the land is physically suited for a Good Shepard Campus, whether the
use will maximize the future use or uses of the land, whether the use is consistent with local planning and zoning, or
if the use is consistent with State and Federal programs.




APPLICATION COMMENTS:

 Interested parties may submit comments regarding the specific use proposed in the recreation and public purposes
application and plan of development, whether the BLM followed proper administrative procedures in reaching the
decision, or any other factor not directly related to the suitability of the land for a Good Shepard Campus.



In the absence of any adverse comments, the realty action will become the final determination of the Department of
the Interior effective 60 days from the date of its publication in the 

Federal Register.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of a Draft Recovery Plan for Blue Shiner for Review and Comment</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of document availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan
for the blue shiner (

Cyprinella caerulea

). It occurs in the headwater river systems of the Coosa River in Georgia and Tennessee, and in smaller tributaries
of the Coosa River in Alabama. Populations are fragmented and isolated by impoundments and by distance. The species
has been extirpated from the Cahaba River system, and Big Wills Creek, Alabama. The Service solicits review and comment
from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program.
To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native
to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish
criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the
recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The species considered in this draft recovery plan is the blue shiner (

Cyprinella caerulea

). This medium-sized minnow is currently known from only the Coosa River system. The blue shiner occurs over a sand
and gravel substrate among cobble in cool, clear water. The blue shiner was listed as threatened on April 22, 1992.
The major threat is water quality degradation, the likely cause of extirpation from the Cahaba River system.

The objective of this proposed plan is to delist the blue shiner. The species may be considered recovered when populations
in the stretches of the Coosa River system identified in the recovery plan are documented to be viable and are fully
protected. Actions needed to reach this goal include: (1) Determining its optimum habitat, (2) determining its life
history, (3) developing and implementing a plan to restore and protect its essential habitat, and (4) monitoring
its populations.

This Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the review period,
it will be submitted for final approval.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f).

Gregory B. Cundiff_Continuance in Control Exemption_Lone Star Railroad, Inc. and Southern Switching Company 



Gregory B. Cundiff (Cundiff) has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Lone Star Railroad, Inc. (Lone
Star) and Southern Switching Company (Southern), upon Lone Star and Southern becoming class III rail carriers. 

Lone Star and Southern, both noncarriers, have concurrently filed a notice of exemption in 

Lone Star Railroad, Inc. and Southern Switching Company_Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Line of Burlington
Northern Railroad Company

, Finance Docket No. 32500, for Lone Star to acquire and Southern to operate 143.3 miles of rail line owned by Burlington
Northern Railroad Company (BN), between milepost 8.0 near Howard, and milepost 151.3 at Abilene, in Archer, Baylor,
Knox, Haskell, Jones and Taylor Counties, TX. The transaction includes 8 miles and 331 feet of incidental trackage
rights for Southern over BN between milepost 8.0 in the vicinity of Howard, and milepost 0.0 at Valley Jct., and from
Valley Jct. east for 331 feet to point of switch in Sunshine Yard in Wichita Falls, Wichita County, TX. The parties intend
to consummate on or after May 18, 1994. 

Cundiff also controls three class III rail carriers: Railroad Switching Service of Missouri, Inc. (operating approximately
4 miles of rail line in St. Louis, MO); Texas Railroad Switching, Inc. (operating 55 miles of rail line between Gardendale
and Carrizo Springs, TX); and Rio Valley Railroad, Inc. (operating 49.12 miles of rail line between Harlingen and
Mission, TX and between Mission and Hidalgo, TX). 

Cundiff indicates that: (1) The properties owned and operated by Lone Star and Southern and the class III rail carriers
listed above do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions
that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction
does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49
U.S.C. 11343. 

See

 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). 

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in 

New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist.

, 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 

Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Thomas F.
McFarland, Jr., Belnap, Spencer, McFarland & Herman, 20 North Wacker Dr., Suite 3118, Chicago, IL 60606-3101.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant To the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Department of Justice Policy, 28 CFR 50.7, 38 FR 19029, notice is hereby given that on May 10, 1994,
a complaint was filed and a proposed consent decree was lodged with the United States District Court for the District
of Idaho in 

United States

 v. 

ASARCO, Inc., et al.,

 Action No. CIV 94-0206-N-HLR. The proposed consent decree settles claims asserted by the United
States at the request of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by the State of Idaho for releases
of hazardous substances at the twenty-one square mile Bunker Hill Superfund Site in northern Idaho. The companies
named as defendants are ASARCO Inc., Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation, Hecla Mining Company, Callahan Mining Company,
Sunshine Precious Metals, Inc., and Sunshine Mining Company.

In the complaint, the United States asserted claims against each of the defendants pursuant to sections 106 and 107(a)
of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9606
and 9607(a), and section 7003 of the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 6973 (RCRA), for injunctive
relief to abate an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment due to the
release or threatened release of hazardous substances at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in Shoshone County, Idaho.
The United States also sought recovery of costs that have been and will be incurred in response to releases and threatened
releases of hazardous substances at and from the Bunker Hill Superfund Site. The State of Idaho asserted a claim for
recovery of costs pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), against defendant Hecla Mining Company.

Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the settling defendants have agreed to perform cleanup activities in the residential
areas of the Site and at Page Pond. The residential areas include the towns of Kellogg, Pinehurst, Smelterville, and
Wardner, as well as the unincorporated communities of Elizabeth Park, Ross Ranch, and Montgomery Gulch. The residential
yards element of the work requires the settling defendants to remediate every yard within the Site boundaries in which
the soil lead levels exceed 1000 parts per million in the top 12 inches of soil. Based upon EPA's projections, it is anticipated
that approximately 1350 additional yards will need to be replaced at the Site (approximately 400 yards have already
been replaced through removal actions conducted over the last several summers). Replacing the yards involves removing
either 6 to 12 inches of top soil, depending on the depth of the lead contamination encountered in the particular yard.
The contaminated soil is then taken to a soil repository within the Site, clean soil is put in its place, and new sod is
planted.

The remedial actions for rights-of-way and commercial properties will involve, at a minimum, capping the contaminated
soils in place, and, where appropriate, removing contaminated soils. Appropriate places for removal will include
rights-of-way and commercial properties located adjacent to residential properties. The Page Ponds tailings impoundments
will be closed as part of the consent decree work, and the marshes that surround the Ponds will be restored, if possible.

Existing water wells within the Site will be closed and residents currently obtaining water from wells will be hooked
up to a municipal supply system.

Because waste will remain at the Site even after remediation is preformed, an institutional control program (``ICP'')
has been developed for the Site in order to prevent releases of hazardous substances and to protect the clean soil barriers
being created in the residential areas. The ICP is designed to be implemented through the Panhandle Health District's
Environmental Health Code. The Health Code will recognize the Health District's overall authority to implement
the ICP and will specify certain provisions that must be adopted as local ordinances by each of the cities or towns within
the Site, as well as Shoshone County, in order to ensure that contamination is contained. In general the goals of the
Environmental Health Code and the new ordinances are to notify persons of the existing contamination and to establish
certain minimum procedures that must be followed in order to avoid the release of hazardous substances.

The consent decree requires the 

de minimis

 settling defendants, Coeur d'Alene Mines and Callahan, to pay $1.23 million to the other settling defendants. The
other settling defendants are obligated to provide $1 million upon entry of the consent decree to be used by the State
to ICP-related work.

Under the settlement, the settling defendants have agreed to pay all oversight costs incurred by EPA and the State
of Idaho in implementing the consent decree. The settling defendants have also agreed to pay up to a total of $8 million
of EPA's past costs incurred at the Site from the proceeds of their ongoing insurance litigation.

In exchange for the commitments made by the settling defendants in the consent decree, the United States and the State
of Idaho have agreed to provide the settling defendants with a covenant not to sue without normal reopener provisions
for the remainder of the Site, including the smelter area and Smelterville Flats. The settling defendants will also
receive a covenant not to sue for segregable portions of the residential areas of the Site upon completion of the remedial
activities within each area. These covenants not to sue for the residential areas will be subject to normal CERCLA
reopener provisions. A covenant not to sue for the ICP will take effect upon full satisfaction of all requirements
imposed by the ICP attachment to the Decree (Attachment D). The covenant not to sue for the 

de minimis

 defendants will be effective upon their payment of the amounts required under the consent decree.

The Department of Justice will receive written comments relating to the proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the
Environment and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer
to 

United States

 v. 

ASARCO, Inc., et al,

 D.J. Ref. No. 90-11-3-1228F.

The proposed Consent Decree and exhibits may be examined at the following locations: The Region 10 Office of EPA, Records
Center, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98101; the Kellogg City Hall, 323 Main Street, Kellogg, ID 83837; the Kellogg
City Hall, Smelterville, ID 83868; and the Pinehurst/Kingston Library, Bunker Hill Superfund site may be reviewed
at the EPA Region 10 office in Seattle and at the Kellogg Public Library.

A copy of the Consent Decree and exhibits (if requested) may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree
Library, 1120 G Street, NW., 4th floor, Washington, DC 20005, (202) 624-0892. In requesting copies, please

<DOCTITLE>Notice Pursuant to the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993; Supercomputer Automotive Applications
Partnership</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that, on July 6, 1993, pursuant to section 6(a) of the National Cooperative Research and Production
Act of 1993, 15 U.S.C. 4301 

et seq. 

(``the Act''), the Supercomputer Automotive Applications Partnership has filed written notifications simultaneously
with the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing (1) the identities of the parties and (2) the
nature and objectives of the venture. The notifications were filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions
limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages under specified circumstances. Pursuant to section
6(b) of the Act, the identities of the parties are General Motors Corporation, Detroit, MI; Chrysler Corporation,
Highland Park, MI; and Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI.

efforts pertaining to use of supercomputer technology in automotive applications. The four initial opportunities
identified are visualization; crash analysis of composite structures; structural mechanics (mesh generation);
and CFD (combustion, aerodynamics and sprays). The objectives are to avoid inefficient duplication of effort and
expense while conducting or directing research in this area, collect, exchange and, where appropriate, license
or otherwise disseminate the results of the research, work closely with various governmental and private agencies
and perform further acts allowed by the National Cooperative Research and Production Act that would advance the Partnership's
objectives.

Proposed Class Exemption To Permit Certain Transactions Authorized Pursuant to Settlement Agreements Between
the U.S. Department of Labor and Plans



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA), Department of Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed class exemption.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains a notice of pendency before the Department of Labor (the Department) of a proposed class exemption
from the prohibited transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code). The proposed class exemption would apply to certain prospective transactions
involving employee benefit plans where such transactions are specifically authorized by the Department pursuant
to a settlement agreement. If granted, the proposed exemption would affect plans, participants and beneficiaries
of such plans, and certain individuals engaging in such transactions or activities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given of the pendency before the Department of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of
sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and from the taxes imposed by section
4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code.





The Department is proposing the class exemption on its own motion pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570, subpart B, (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).






Background



The Department is proposing the class exemption contained in this notice as part of a continuing effort to facilitate
voluntary settlements arising from investigations involving violations of title I of ERISA. The rules set forth
in section 406 of ERISA prohibit various transactions between plans and certain related parties, unless a statutory
or administrative exemption applies to the transaction. These related parties, such as plan fiduciaries, sponsoring
employers, unions and service providers, are defined as parties in interest in section 3(14) of ERISA, and, in the
absence of an exemption, may not engage in transactions described in section 406 of ERISA with a plan.

Specifically, section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) prohibits a fiduciary of a plan from causing the plan to engage in
a transaction that constitutes a direct or an indirect: Sale or exchange or leasing of any property between the plan
and a party in interest; lending of money or other extension of credit between the plan and a party in interest; furnishing
of goods, services or facilities between the plan and a party in interest; or transfer to, or use by or for the benefit
of, a party in interest, of any assets of the plan. Section 406(a)(2) provides that no fiduciary who has authority or
discretion to control or manage plan assets shall permit the plan to hold any employer security or employer real property
if he knows or should know that holding such security or real property violates section 407(a) of ERISA. Section 406(b)(1)
and (b)(2) prohibits a fiduciary, with respect to a plan, from dealing with the assets of the plan in his own interest
or for his own account; or acting in his individual capacity or in any other capacity in any transaction involving the
plan on behalf of a party (or representing a party) whose interests are adverse to the interests of the plan or the interests
of the participants or beneficiaries. In addition, such transactions are generally subject to taxation under section
4975 of the Code.

In the past, the Department has frequently exercised its statutory authority under section 408(a) of ERISA to grant
both individual and class exemptions from the restrictions imposed by section 406 of ERISA where it has been able to
find that the statutory criteria have been met.
 This process has been helpful in providing exemptive relief for transaction which were otherwise prohibited, but
were in the interest of the plan.

The Department has promulgated an exemption procedure
 which provides, among other things, that an exemption will not be granted until a notice of pendency has been published
in the 

Federal Register

, and interested persons have been given an opportunity to comment on the proposed transaction. Following consideration
of the entire record, the Department then makes its final determination whether to grant the exemption. If the Department
contemplates not granting the requested exemption, the procedure also provides an applicant with the right to a conference.





In most instances, the Department grants individual exemptions for specific transactions involving particular
plans and parties in interest. Such exemptions are generally made at the request of the parties involved. In certain
cases, however, the Department believes that an exemption applicable to a class of transactions would be appropriate
in order to eliminate the need for individuals exemptions.

In this regard, the Department granted Prohibited Transaction Exemption 79-15
 to permit parties to engage in transactions or activities that are specifically authorized or required, prior to
the occurrence of such transactions or activities, by a court order of the United States District Court provided that
the transaction is specifically described in such order or settlement, and the Secretary of Labor or the Internal
Revenue Service is a party to the litigation. PTE 79-15 was granted in recognition of the fact that under these
circumstances the court has the benefit of the views of the Department and the Internal Revenue Service as to the propriety
of rendering a judgment which approves a settlement contemplating transactions which might be prohibited under
ERISA and the Code.





Similar considerations apply to non-judicial settlement agreements involving a plan and the Department following
the Department's investigation of a plan. PWBA, through its various area offices, conducts investigations regarding
the operation of plans covered by ERISA. Following the completion of an investigation, the Department notifies the
responsible plan fiduciaries of its findings by letter. In many instances, this letter (the Voluntary Compliance
Letter) provides the fiduciary with the opportunity to avoid litigation with the Department over the issues raised
in the Voluntary Compliance Letter by taking voluntary corrective action. In some cases, the corrective action that
is most advantageous to the plan involves a transaction with a party in interest that would be prohibited under section
406 of ERISA.

The following examples illustrate the types of transactions that may arise in the context of settlement discussions.





Example (1)

 


A plan purchased a building comprising 60 percent of the plan's assets. Following an investigation of the plan, the
Department notifies the responsible plan fiduciary that such transaction appears to violate several provisions
of ERISA. As part of the settlement agreement, the Department and the fiduciary agree that the plan sponsor will purchase
the building from the plan, and will reimburse the plan for any losses which may have accrued up to the date of the sale.



Example (2)


Upon investigation of a plan, the Department discovers that the plan owns a promissory note evidencing a loan to a company
wholly owned by the plan fiduciary. At the conclusion of its investigation, the Department notifies the plan fiduciary
that such transaction violates the restrictions contained in section 406 of ERISA. The plan fiduciary and the Department
agree to settle the matter without resort to litigation. As part of the settlement, the plan fiduciary will purchase
the note from the plan for the greater of fair market value or the outstanding balance of the loan plus accrued interest.



Example (3)


In 1991, a plan's fiduciaries invested a significant percentage of plan assets in a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)
without a proper investigation of the investment merits of the transaction. Following receipt of a complaint from
a participant of the plan, the Department contacts the plan's fiduciaries and discovers that the value of the plan's
investment in the REIT has declined since its acquisition and is now less than 50 percent of the amount of the plan's
original investment. The Department informed the fiduciaries that they breached their fiduciary responsibilities
under ERISA by investing plan assets in the REIT. The Department agrees to settle the matter without resort to litigation
by among other things, accepting the plan sponsor's offer to purchase the plan's interest in the REIT and to reimburse
the plan for any losses which the plan has suffered during its investment in the REIT.

Because the transactions relating to the settlement agreements described above would be prohibited under section
406 of ERISA, each plan fiduciary would be required to seek an administrative exemption from the Department prior
to entering into each transaction. Requiring the plan fiduciary to file an exemption application with PWBA's Office
of Exemption Determinations could result in an unnecessary delay in implementing the settlement agreement and effectuating
the remedy for the plan. The purpose of the proposed exemption is to permit such transactions or activities to proceed
without the need for an individual exemption, provided the conditions of this exemption are met.



Discussion of the Proposed Exemption



1. Scope



The proposed exemption would provide relief from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D), 406(a)(2),
406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975(a) and (b) of the
Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code of transactions authorized by the Department pursuant
to a settlement agreement, following an investigation conducted by the Department.

The Department notes that the proposal does not provide exemptive relief for the transactions or activities cited
as violations by the Department in the Voluntary Compliance Letter. Rather, the proposed exemption provides relief
for prospective transactions which are specifically agreed to by the Department as part of a settlement of the issues
raised in the Voluntary Compliance Letter. Accordingly, the parties to the alleged violation(s) would remain liable
for any excise taxes owing under section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code with respect to the transactions or activities
cited in the Voluntary Compliance Letter as prohibited under section 406 of ERISA. In addition, the proposed exemption
would not affect the liability of any person for the civil penalties imposed on applicable recovery amounts under
section 502(1) of ERISA.



2. Proposed Conditions



The proposed exemption contains conditions, as discussed below, which the Department views as necessary to ensure
that any transaction or activity covered by the proposed exemption would be in the interest of plan participants and
to support a finding that the proposed exemption meets the statutory standards of section 408(a) of ERISA.

<DOCNO> FR940527-2-00112 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposal, the Department must be a party to the settlement agreement. In authorizing the transaction that
would otherwise be prohibited, the Department will give appropriate consideration to whether such transaction
is in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is an appropriate measure for inclusion in a settlement
of issues uncovered during the investigation. Accordingly, relief is limited to those transactions which have been
authorized by the Department pursuant to a settlement agreement, following the Department's investigation. The
Department notes that the proposed exemption is intended only to facilitate the implementation of settlement agreements
where the proposed transaction agreed to by the parties as part of such settlement involves a separate prohibited
transaction. Thus, the proposed exemption should not be construed as a substitute for compliance with the statutory
requirements of ERISA and the Code. Individuals desiring to engage in any other transaction that is prohibited under
section 406 of ERISA, and is not the subject of an existing administrative or statutory exemption, must seek exemption
relief in accordance with the Department's exemption procedures.






Second, the proposal requires that a transaction or activity, in order to be covered by the exemption, must be specifically
authorized or required in writing by the terms of the settlement agreement with the Department. This condition is
intended to limit the application of the class exemption to situations where it is clear that the Department has considered
the appropriateness of the transaction or activity for which the exemption is provided. The requirement of a writing
is necessary to avoid subsequent disputes concerning the nature of the exempted transaction.

Third, the proposed exemption requires that written notice of the transaction or activity be given by a party who is
to engage in the transaction or activity to all affected participants and beneficiaries in advance of the transaction
or activity taking place so that the PWBA office will have sufficient time to consider any comments. In addition, a
copy of the notice and the method of distribution must be approved in advance by the PWBA area or district office which
conducted the investigation and negotiated the settlement. The notice must include an objective description of
the transaction or activity, the address of the PWBA area or district office that conducted the investigation and
negotiated the settlement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their
comments to such office. The purpose of this notice requirement is to afford affected participants and beneficiaries
the opportunity to provide relevant information to the PWBA area or district office. This notice requirement should
not be construed as conferring any additional procedural obligations upon the Department; nor does it require any
further action by the Department prior to completion of the transaction or activity.

The proposed exemption does not specify the manner in which notice must be provided to participants and beneficiaries.
However, it is the Department's intent that notice be provided in such a manner that is reasonably calculated to result
in its receipt by all participants and beneficiaries at least 30 days prior to entry into the settlement agreement.

Finally, the proposal requires compliance with all other conditions of the exemption before the transaction or activity
occurs. The purpose of the proposed exemption is to provide an exemption for an otherwise prohibited transaction
or activity that is undertaken at the behest of the Department to rectify the violations of ERISA. The proposal is not
intended to serve as a retroactive exemption for transactions that are in progress or have already occurred a the time
of the settlement with the Department.



Notice to Interested Persons



Because many participants, plans, fiduciaries and parties in interests with respect to plans could conceivably
be considered interested persons, the only practical form of notice of the proposed exemption is publication in the


Federal Register

.

<PARENT> FR940527-2-00094 </PARENT>

The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a plan from
certain other provisions of ERISA and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption
does not expressly apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of ERISA. Section 404
requires, in part, that a fiduciary discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of ERISA. This exemption
does not affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that a plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the
employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries.

(2) The proposed exemption, if granted, will not extend to transactions prohibited under section 406(b)(3) of ERISA
and section 4975(c)(1)(F) of the Code.

(3) Before this exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of plans and of participants and beneficiaries
and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plans.

(4) The proposed exemption, if granted will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of other provisions of ERISA
and the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore, the fact that
a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction
is in fact a prohibited transaction.

(5) If granted, the proposed exemption will be applicable to a transaction only if the conditions specified in the
class exemption are satisfied.



Written Comments and Hearing Requests



All interested persons are invited to submit written comments or requests for a public hearing on the proposed exemption
to the address above and within the time period set forth above. Comments received will be made part of the record and
will be available for public inspection at the above address.



Proposed Exemption



The Department has under consideration the granting of the following class exemption, under the authority of section
408(a) of ERISA and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR part 2570,
subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990).

Effective (date of publication of final class exemption), the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1) (A) through (D),
406(a)(2), 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of ERISA and the taxes imposed by sections 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, by reason
of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to a transaction or activity which is authorized,
prior to the occurrence of such transaction or activity, by a settlement agreement resulting from an investigation
of an employee benefit plan conducted by the Department under the authority of section 504(a) of ERISA, provided that:
(A) The nature of such transaction or activity is specifically described in writing, by the terms of such settlement
agreement.

(B) The Department of Labor is a party to the settlement agreement.

(C) A party who will be engaging in the transaction or activity has provided written notice to the affected participants
and beneficiaries in a manner that is reasonably calculated to result in the receipt of such notice at least 30 days
prior to entry into the settlement agreement.

(D) A copy of the notice and the method of distribution is approved in advance by the area or district office of the Department
which negotiated the settlement.

(E) The notice includes an objective description of the transaction or activity, the approximate date on which the
transaction or activity will occur, the address of the area or district office of the Department which negotiated
the settlement agreement, and a statement apprising participants and beneficiaries of their right to forward their
comments to such office.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

The remainder of the 1994 state support grant to SLLS will be transferred to LLCI; thus LLCI will receive $94,314 in
state support grant funding for the remainder of 1994. (LLCI will also receive the unexpended balance of LSC state
support funds held by SLLS, with some adjustments). In 1995, LLCI will receive the full annualized allocation for
Louisiana state support funding.

<USDEPT>PACIFIC NORTHWEST ELECTRIC POWER AND CONSERVATION PLANNING COUNCIL</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Power Plan Amendments: Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program</DOCTITLE>


May 17, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (funding for resident fish projects
above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section
839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments
to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program) to clarify funding responsibilities for resident
fish substitution projects above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams. Copies of the proposed amendments are available and
comments are solicited.




BACKGROUND: 

The Council's fish and wildlife program calls for various parties to consult and propose funding responsibilities
for resident fish substitution projects above Hells Canyon and Pelton Dams. If the parties were unable to agree, the
program commits the Council to initiate rulemaking to clarify these responsibilities. The parties have submitted
agreements, and the Council is initiating rulemaking based on the agreements. The proposed amendments call for:
Bonneville Power Administration to fund certain projects on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation and the Fort Hall
Reservation; for various parties to identify projects for funding by the Idaho Power Company and the Bureau of Reclamation;
and for Bonneville and Portland General Electric Company to share funding of certain projects associated with Pelton
Dam.




OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: 

The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, June 17, 1994. Comments
should be clearly marked ``Resident Fish Substitution Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs
Division, 851 SW. Sixth Avenue, suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate
further consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment before making a final decision. A final decision
is expected to be made in July 1994. HEARINGS: The Council is in the process of scheduling hearings in the four Northwest
states. Please call the Council's public affairs division for information on the schedule and location for hearings,
and watch for further information in the Council's newsletter, Update. To reserve a time to testify at a hearing, please
call Ms. Judi Hertz at 1-800-222-3355 (if calling from Idaho, Montana or Washington), 1-800-452-2324
(if calling from Oregon), or 222-5161 (if calling from the Portland area).


Please contact the Council's Public Affairs Division to reserve a time to testify. Witnesses should be prepared to
summarize briefly, rather than read, any written statement they wish to enter into the record.

<DOCTITLE>Power Plan Amendments; Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program</DOCTITLE>

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (evaluation of Lake Pend Oreille
Lake levels).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section
839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments
to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program) calling for an evaluation of the effect of lake levels
and other factors on kokanee salmon in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho. Copies of the proposed amendments, together with
a proposed scope of work for the evaluation are available and comments are solicited.




BACKGROUND: 

The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate investigation of the relationship between water levels in Lake
Pend Oreille and the health of kokanee salmon, which appears to have declined since the time that the Lake began to be
deeply drafted for power production and other purposes. The effect of factors such as tributary habitat production
potential, lake productivity and predator abundance would also be investigated. The evaluation is expected to take
5 years, and would constrain certain operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System.




OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: 

The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, June 17, 1994. Comments
should be clearly marked ``Lake Pend Oreille Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs Division,
851 SW. Sixth Avenue, suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate further
consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment before making a final decision. A final decision

<DOCTITLE>Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program; Power Plan Amendments</DOCTITLE>





May 11, 1994.





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Northwest Power Planning Council).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for recommendations for amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (measures for anadromous
fish).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section
839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) invites recommendations
for amendments to the anadromous fish provisions of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program).




BACKGROUND: 

The Strategy for Salmon, which the Northwest Power Planning Council adopted in December, 1992 and later incorporated
into the 1994 Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program, called for reports to be prepared on a variety of measures
to improve passage of anadromous fish in their mainstem migration, including: reservoir drawdowns; potential new
Snake River Basin storage facilities; water efficiencies, transactions or other nonstructural measures to secure
more Snake River Basin water for anadromous fish; biological rule curves to protect resident fish and wildlife populations
associated with Libby and Hungry Horse reservoirs in Montana; and other matters. Reports on these matters are now
or soon will be available, and the Council plans to conduct a rulemaking process this summer to consider these reports.
Since the Strategy for Salmon was adopted, a number of other issues have arisen in connection with the National Marine
Fisheries Service's 1993 and 1994 biological opinions, the National Marine Fisheries Service Recovery Team's recommendations,
the federal court settlement discussions in 

Idaho Department of Fish and Game

 v. 

National Marine Fisheries Service

, and other matters. To ensure that the Council takes these matters fully into account in its rulemaking process, the
Council is requesting recommendations regarding all measures for anadromous fish.




REQUEST FOR RECOMMENDATIONS: 

The Council invites the federal and the region's state fish and wildlife agencies, the region's Indian tribes, and
others to submit recommendations for measures to protect, mitigate and enhance anadromous fish affected by hydroelectric
facilities located on the Columbia River and its tributaries. While any such recommendation will be considered,
the Council intends to focus the amendment process in the following areas:





 Measures to improve the survival of anadromous fish at and between hydroelectric facilities located on the
Columbia River system;

 Harvest, hatchery and habitat issues raised by the National Marine Fisheries Service's biological opinions,
related litigation, or the National Marine Fisheries Service recovery planning program.

Recommendations must be submitted by 5 p.m. Pacific time on August 15, 1994, to Rick Applegate, Director, Fish and
Wildlife Division, Northwest Power Planning Council 851 S.W. Sixth Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97204-1348.

The Council has prepared application forms specifying the Council's requirements for information for recommendations
to amend the program. Interested parties may use these forms, or may submit recommendations in letter form. In either
case, amendment recommendations should contain the information specified in the ``Amendment Process'' chapter
of the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program.

The Council will make the recommendations available to interested parties for comment, and will hold hearings in
Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington before taking final action. The Council expects to make decisions on these
matters before the end of 1994.

Changes and Corrections to EDGAR Phase-in list 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is publishing a list of changes and corrections to the EDGAR phase-in list for companies whose filings
are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In connection with the adoption of interim rules to implement the operational phase of the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system, on March 18, 1993 the Commission published a list of companies whose
filings are processed by the Division of Corporation Finance to place registrants on notice as to when they would become
subject to mandated electronic filing.
 The registrants were divided into ten groups to be phased in over the next three years. Rule 901 of Regulation S-T
 provides that registrants may request a change to their assigned phase-in dates. Such requests may be granted pursuant
to delegated authority. In addition, modifications are made to the list to reflect name changes, corporate restructurings,
the addition of new entities, and similar factors. Changes to the Division of Corporation Finance phase-in list are
published from time to time in the SEC News Digest. The Commission today is publishing a comprehensive list of all changes
in Division of Corporation Finance phase-in group assignments made since the phase-in list was published in March
1993; this list supersedes the list of changes published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 27, 1993 (Release No. 33-7023 (October 21, 1993) [58 FR 57877]). This procedure will be repeated from
time to time, in order to further notify the public of changes to the list. A change to a company's phase-in date is of
particular importance to persons or entities filing documents with respect to that company, since generally such
persons must file electronically when the company becomes subject to electronic filing.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974: Modification and Deletion of Systems of </DOCTITLE>
Records 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notification of deletion of Privacy Act Systems of 
Records and minor changes to descriptions of existing records systems for the Securities and Exchange Commission.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Securities and Exchange Commission is deleting seven
records systems that are either obsolete or were replaced by another existing system; and altering the notices of
forty-three existing systems of records to reflect revisions to the agency's address, records retention and disposal
schedule, notification procedures and record access procedures, updating the names of records systems, and designating
new systems managers. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the course of reviewing its Privacy Act Systems of Records notices, the Securities and Exchange Commission identified
two systems notices whose records duplicate those covered by SEC-16 (Complaint Processing System). Another
record system is no longer maintained separately as its records have been consolidated in SEC-102 (Enforcement
Files). Three systems notices are being deleted because they are obsolete. 
SEC-15 (Comments on Commission and Securities Self-Regulatory Organization Rules Changes) is not retrieved
by a name or personal identifier, and therefore not a legitimate Privacy Act System. The Commission also identified
forty-three notices that require minor alterations. For the most part, these changes involve updating the Commission's
address. The other changes include revising records and disposal procedures, notification procedures and record
access procedures, revising the names of systems of records due to the renaming of an office, and designating new systems
managers. None of these changes will affect an individual's ability to gain access to his or her records maintained
by the Commission. 


* * * * * 


The following systems of records are either: (1) obsolete; (2) not retrieved by name or personal identifier and, therefore,
not legitimate Privacy Act systems; or (3) no longer maintained by the SEC as independent systems and accordingly,
the corresponding notices are deleted from the 

Federal Register

in either or both of the stocks involved in a merger or acquisition (``M&A stock(s)''), even if the member was not
previously a market maker in either of the stocks. However, if a market maker withdraws on an unexcused basis from any
stock in which it was registered pursuant to this subsection within 20 days of so registering, it shall not be designated
as a qualified market maker pursuant to this subsection for any subsequent merger or acquisition announced within
three months subsequent to such unexcused withdrawal. Second, the NASD proposes to amend Interpretation A under
the rule to clarify that short sales effected by a qualified market maker in one M&A stock will be deemed to be bona
fide market making activity if they hedge purchases in the other M&A stock made by the market maker during the course
of bona fide market making activity. Therefore, the amendment clarifies that such short sales will be exempted under
the rule. The NASD also proposes to make other minor amendments to the short sale rule.
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary of the NASD and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In response to concerns raised by several NASD members actively engaged in risk arbitrage, the NASD is proposing two
amendments to its proposed short sale rule that are designed to enhance the liquidity of stocks involved in a merger
or acquisition.
 In essence, the risk arbitrageurs contend that they should be afforded an exemption from the short sale rule because
they provide important market liquidity to the marketplace during the period before a merger or acquisition is consummated.
Specifically, the risk arbitrageurs maintain that they provide liquidity to security holders in a target company
who are unwilling to assume the risk of completion of the merger or acquisition. The risk arbitrageurs also contend
that they are more likely to better analyze and understand a merger or acquisition transaction than the market makers
who were making markets in the stocks prior to the announcement of the transaction. Thus, the risk artibrageurs maintain
that they are better able to price M&A stocks.




The NASD has worked closely with the risk arbritrageurs to address their concerns and formulate the current amendments
to the rule. As a result, the NASD believes the amendments strike a reasonable balance between the needs of risk arbitrageurs
to facilitate the liquidity demands of investors in M&A stocks and the NASD's need to implement a meaningful short
sale rule for the The Nasdaq Stock Market

SM

 (``Nasdaq'') that does not contain broad and sweeping exemptions that eviscerate the rule's effectiveness. In addition,
as described below, even though the amendments were crafted with the concerns of risk arbitrageurs in mind, they apply
to all NASD members.
First, the NASD proposes to make it easier for market makers to become qualified market makers in stocks involved in
a merger or acquisition. Specifically, under the amendment, once a merger or acquisition is publicly announced,
any market maker can immediately become a qualified market maker in either M&A stock pursuant to Section (1)(3)(iii)
of the rule, regardless of whether the member previously made a market in either or both of the stocks. Before this amendment,
if a market maker did not previously make a market in either of the M&A stocks, it would have had to make a market in
each of the stocks for 20 business days before it was eligible to be a qualified market maker in the stocks. In addition,
before this amendment, a market maker could immediately become a qualified market maker in an M&A stock only if
it was already a qualified market maker in the other M&A stock. Even though this amendment is designed to facilitate
the market making activities of risk arbitrageurs, there is no requirement that market makers engage in risk arbitrage
if they take advantage of the immediate registration provisions contained in section (1)(3)(iii) of the rule.
The NASD believes that allowing members to immediately become qualified market makers in M&A stocks will enable
Nasdaq to better satisfy investors' increased liquidity demands resulting from the announcement of a merger or acquisition.
In addition, the NASD believes that allowing members to more readily become qualified makers in M&A stocks will
help to promote pricing efficiency in these stocks at a time when they are more volatile. Moreover, the NASD believes
permitting market makers to immediately become qualified market makers in M&A stocks is consistent with the
treatment of market makers in the context of initial public offerings (``IPOs'').





In order to deter market makers from entering and withdrawing as qualified market makers in M&A stocks to suit
their own pecuniary interests, however, the proposal provides that if a market maker withdraws on an unexcused basis
from any M&A stock in which it immediately registered as a qualified market maker within 20 days of so registering,
that it shall not be immediately designated as a qualified market maker for any subsequent merger or acquisition announced
within three months subsequent to such unexcused withdrawal.
Second, the NASD proposes to amend Interpretation A under the rule to provide more guidance to qualified market makers
when they hedge purchases in one M&A stock with sales in the other and vice versa. Specifically, under the proposal,
if a market maker purchases or reasonably anticipates purchasing an M&A stock during the course of bona fide market
making, then short sales in the other M&A stock by the market maker to hedge these purchases will be deemed to be
bona fide market making activity; and, therefore, exempt from the bid test. Conversely, if a qualified market maker
sells an M&A stock short during the normal course of bona fide market making, the amendment provides that these
short sales will not lose their exemption if the market maker later purchases the other M&A stock in a capacity
other than normal bona fide market making. In addition, the amended Interpretation clarifies that the amount of stock
sold short by a qualified market maker to hedge purchases of the other M&A stock must be reasonably consistent
with the exchange ratio specified by the terms of the merger or acquisition. Thus, if the exchange ratio is three shares
of the target for one share of the acquiring company, then the purchase of 300 shares of the target's stock would generally
be hedged by no more than 100 shares of the acquiring company.

<TEXT>
 

The NASD believes that the expanded Interpretation will provide qualified market makers with more certainty when
they hedge transactions in one M&A stock with transactions in the other M&A stock. Moreover, the NASD believes
that requiring market makers to adhere to the exchange ratios will help to ensure that market makers do not ``over short''
one M&A stock when hedging purchases in the other M&A stock.
In addition, the NASD is proposing several minor changes to its short sale rule. First, the NASD proposes to amend Section
(c)(7) of the short sale rule to clarify that the exemption from the rule afforded transactions in special international
arbitrage accounts is available to non-NASD members as well as NASD members. Second, the NASD proposes to amend Section
(k) of its short sale rule and Sections (h) and (i) of its proposed Primary Nasdaq Market Maker rule to reflect recent
amendments to the NASD's By-Laws concerning the ability of the NASD's Board of Governors to adopt and amend NASD Rules
of Fair Practice without a membership vote.
 Lastly the NASD proposes to clarify that the review period for review of market maker performance in each of the Primary
Nasdaq Market Maker qualification standards is one month.




The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 11A(c)(1)(F) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market. Section 11A(c)(1)(F)
assures equal regulation of all markets for qualified securities and all exchange members, brokers, and dealers
effecting transactions in such securities. Specifically, as noted in prior filings regarding the NASD's short sale
rule, approval of the proposed short sale rule would result in equivalent short sale regulation in the exchange and
Nasdaq markets and would work to prevent fraud and manipulation with respect to short sales in the Nasdaq market. Moreover,
the NASD believes that allowing market makers to immediately register as qualified market makers in M&A stocks
will promote market liquidity and enhance pricing efficiency at a time when they are most needed. In addition, the
NASD believes that the three month restriction for premature, unexcused withdrawals in M&A stocks will help
to ensure that market makers in M&A stocks do not enter the market merely to use the exemption to the rule to engage
in aggressive short selling designed to drive down the price of a security. Finally, the NASD believes the additions
to Interpretation A under the rule will provide market makers with more certainty regarding when they are entitled
to an exemption from the rule, thereby promoting market efficiency and enhancing the orderliness of the market.
With respect to the other proposed amendments discussed in this filing, the NASD believes they will serve to reduce
investor confusion concerning the application and operation of the NASD's short sale rule, thereby promoting efficient
and fair markets.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:
A. by order approve such proposed rule change, or 
B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

risks charge imposed under certain flexible purchase payment individual variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Principal Mutual, a mutual life insurance company, was incorporated under the laws of Iowa in 1879 as Bankers Life
Association. It changed its name to Bankers Life Company in 1911 and assumed its present name in 1986. Principal Mutual
sells life, disability, and health insurance, and annuities written both on an individual and group basis.

2. Separate Account B was established on January 12, 1970. It is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust.
Under Iowa insurance laws and regulations the income, gains or losses, whether or not realized, of Separate Account
B are credited to or charged against the assets of Separate Account B without regard to the other income, gains or losses,
of Principal Mutual. Separate Account B is divided into three divisions (``Divisions'') corresponding to the three
mutual funds (``Mutual Funds'') in which its assets may be invested. The Mutual Funds are diversified, open-end,
management investment companies that serve as funding vehicles for variable insurance products of Principal Mutual
and are not offered directly to the public. Principal Mutual may, at a later date, determine to create additional Divisions
of Separate Account B to invest in any additional Mutual Fund shares which may be issued in the future or in the shares
of other investment companies.

3. Princor, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Principal Mutual, will be the principal underwriter of the Contracts. It
is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.

4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual variable annuity contracts which provide for the accumulation
of values on a fixed or variable basis and the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed basis. The Contracts are designed
to provide individuals with retirement benefits in connection with certain plans entitled to special tax treatment
under the Internal Revenue Code and in connection with non-tax qualified retirement plans. Subject to certain restrictions,
amounts accumulated may be transferred among Divisions of Separate Account B or to or from Principal Mutual's general
account.

5. The owner of a Contract may allocate purchase payments among the available Divisions of Separate Account B and to
Principal Mutual's general account for accumulation on a fixed basis (the ``Fixed Account''). The owner may also
transfer on either a scheduled or unscheduled basis amounts accumulated in any Division or the Fixed Account subject
to certain restrictions. For any unscheduled transfer from a Division made after the twelfth such transfer in a Contract
year, Principal Mutual may impose a transaction fee not to exceed $30. Such charge is designed to cover the administrative
expenses associated with the transfer. Transfers among Divisions of Separate Account B will be made in reliance upon
the exemptive relief provided by Rule 11a-2 under the Act.

6. On the last day of each Contract year prior to the commencement of annuity payments, Principal Mutual will deduct
from the accumulated value of the Contract an annual fee equal to the lesser of $30 or 2% of the accumulated value. The
fee will be deducted from the owner's interest in either the Fixed Account or a Division of Separate Account B, whichever
has the greatest value. The annual fee will also be deducted if the Contract is surrendered on any date other than a Contract
anniversary. No annual fee will be deducted, either annually or upon surrender, if the accumulated value of the Contract
is at least $30,000 at the time the fee is to be deducted.

7. Principal Mutual reserves the right to deduct from each Division of Separate Account B each valuation period an
administrative expense charge equivalent to a nominal annual rate not greater than .15% of the average daily net assets
of the Division. The annual fee and the administrative expense charge are designed to help cover administrative costs
relating to the Contracts, such as those incurred in issuing Contracts, establishing and maintaining Contract records,
making regulatory filings, furnishing notices, voting materials and other communications, providing computer,
actuarial and accounting services, and processing Contract transactions. The annual fee and administrative expense
charge are designed only to reimburse Principal Mutual for administrative expenses on a cumulative basis. With respect
to any issued Contract, the annual fee is guaranteed never to be increased and the administrative expense charge,
if imposed, is guaranteed never to be increased above .15% on an annualized basis. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a-1
under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to impose the annual fee and the administrative expense charge.
8. Principal Mutual will deduct amounts necessary to cover any premium taxes required by state or local law. Such deductions
may be made from purchase payments when received or from the Contract's accumulated value when surrendered (in whole
or in part) or applied to provide annuity payments. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a-2(d) under the Act to permit
the deduction of such taxes from the assets of Separate Account B.
9. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, Principal Mutual will deduct
a surrender charge (contingent deferred sales charge) on certain total and partial surrenders of the Contract on
or prior to the commencement of annuity payments. The surrender charge is intended to partially reimburse Principal
Mutual for expenses incurred in the sale of the Contracts, including commissions and other promotional or distribution
expenses associated with the marketing of the Contracts.
10. The surrender charge is a percentage of the purchase payments withdrawn or surrendered which were received by
Principal Mutual during the seven-year period prior to the withdrawal or surrender. The applicable percentage is
based on the number of completed Contract years between the Contract year in which the purchase payment was paid and
the Contract year of surrender. For purchase payments received less than three completed Contract years at the time
of surrender, the surrender charge is six percent of the purchase payment. For purchase payments received three or
more completed Contract years at the time of surrender, the surrender charge is reduced one percent each Contract
year, so that purchase payments held for three completed Contract years are subject to a five percent charge, purchase
payments held for four completed Contract years are subject to a four percent charge, and so forth. Purchase payments
held for seven or more completed Contract years are not subject to any surrender charge. For purposes of calculating
the surrender charge, amounts surrendered are deemed to be, first, purchase payments made in Contract years no longer
subject to a surrender charge, then, amounts entitled to a free surrender privilege and, then, purchase payments
made on a first-in, first-out basis. The amount of the surrender charge may be reduced in circumstances permitted
by the Act and the rules thereunder.
11. Pursuant to a free surrender privilege, no surrender charge will apply to surrenders made during a Contract year
in an amount not exceeding the greater of (i) the Contract's accumulated value minus purchase payments not surrendered
and (ii) an amount equal to (a) ten percent of purchase payments still subject to a surrender charge as of the last Contract
anniversary plus (b) 10 percent of any purchase payments made since the last Contract anniversary reduced by (c) any
partial surrenders made since the last Contract anniversary. In addition, no surrender charge applies to amounts
used to provide annuity payments or a death benefit payment or amounts distributed to satisfy the minimum distribution
requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. Finally, if permitted by state law, the surrender
charged will be waived, pursuant to a rider to the Contracts and subject to the conditions set forth therein, as to the
payment of any amounts after the first Contract anniversary as a result of the owner's or annuitant's being confined
to a health care facility (as defined in the rider), having been diagnosed as having a terminal illness (as defined
in the rider) or being totally and permanently disabled (as defined in the rider). Applicants will rely on Rule 6c-8
under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to permit imposition of the surrender charge.
12. Principal Mutual will also deduct a $30 transaction charge for each unscheduled partial surrender made after
the first such surrender during a Contract year. Such charge, designed to cover the administrative expenses associated
with the surrender, will be deducted from the owner's interest in the Fixed Account or each Division of Separate Account
B from which the surrender is made in the same proportion that the amount surrendered from the Fixed Account or such
Division bears to the total amount surrendered. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a-1 under the Act for the necessary
exemptive relief to charge such fee.
13. Principal Mutual assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that
annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. Principal Mutual assumes this mortality risk by virtue
of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that neither
his longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity
payments. Also, Principal Mutual guarantees that if the annuitant dies before the commencement of annuity payments
it will pay a minimum death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Principal Mutual is the risk that actual administration
expenses incurred in connection with issuing and administering the Contracts will exceed the limits on administrative
charges set in the Contracts.

<TEXT>
 

14. To compensate it for assuming these risks, Principal Mutual deducts from each Division a charge each valuation
period equivalent to an annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily net assets of the division, consisting of .80% for
mortality risks and .45% for expense risks. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased,
and the charge is assessed only during the period prior to the commencement of annuity payments. If the charge is insufficient
to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertaking. Principal Mutual will bear the loss. Conversely,
if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to Principal Mutual and will be available for any
proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act requires that all payments received under periodic payment plan certificates
by held by a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor
or principal underwriter except for the payment of a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may
prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services.

2. Applicants submit that Principal Mutual is entitled to reasonable compensation for its assumption of mortality
and expense risks and Applicants represent that the 1.25% charge for the Contracts is within the range of industry
practice for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon an analysis by
Principal Mutual of publicly available information about selected similar industry products. Principal Mutual
shall maintain at its principal office, available to the Commission upon request, a memorandum setting forth in detail
the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey made.

3. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charge under the Contracts will be insufficient to cover all costs relating
to the distribution of the Contracts and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all
or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the surrender charge. In such circumstances
a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the costs relating to
distribution of the Contracts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Principal Mutual has concluded that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit
Separate Account B and the Contract owners. The basis for the conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by Principal Mutual at its principal office and will be available to the Commission upon request.

4. Principal Mutual represents that Separate Account B will invest only in underlying mutual funds which undertake,
in the event such funds should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such
plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons''
of such fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, their request for exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the Act is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

National Fuel Resources, Inc., at al. (70-7833) 



National Fuel Resources, Inc. (``Resources'') and Leidy Hub, Inc. (``Leidy Hub''),
 each of 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, each a non-utility subsidiary of National Fuel Gas Company (``NFG''),
a registered holding company, have filed a post-effective amendment under sections 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and
Rule 45 thereunder to their application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and
Rules 45 and 50(a)(5) thereunder. 





By order dated December 20, 1991 (HCAR No. 25437), NFG was authorized to: (i) Acquire all of the authorized shares of
common stock of Resources for $3.5 million in cash; (ii) acquire through Resources, a 50% interest in a partnership
(``Partnership''), named Citizens National Gas Company, with Citizens Gas Supply Corporation (``Citizens Gas'')
for $1.5 million in cash; (iii) include Resources in the NFG system money pool (``Money Pool'') for a maximum of $10
million; and (iv) make available to the Partnership, through Resources, through December 31, 1991, one or more loans
aggregating up to $10 million. It was stated that the $10 million would be used by the Partnership for investment in
``any and all physical assets, and any and all associated contracts and property interest attendant thereto, for
use in connection with gathering, transportation, distribution or marketing of natural gas which it would consider
taking for itself, and which is consistent with, or is a natural and reasonable extension of, its business'' (``Marketing-Related
Investments''). 

In the quarter ended September 30, 1993, Resources and Citizens National Gas Company completed the sale of substantially
all of the Partnership assets. Thereafter, the Partnership was wound up and dissolved. 

Resources now proposes to use its existing authorization to borrow up to $15 million from the Money Pool in order to
make investments in Marketing-Related Investments. (Resources presently has the authority, by order dated December
29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25964), to borrow, through December 31, 1995, up to $15 million from the Money Pool). It is stated
that the majority of these Marketing-Related Investments will be the purchase of gas reserves, gas pipelines and
appurtenant property. 

Resources also proposed to acquire Leidy Hub's investment in Metscan, Inc. (``Metscan''). Leidy presently owns
7.31% of Metscan's common stock, 9.83% of the Metscan Class A Preferred Stock and 1.07% of the Class B Preferred, or
about 5.52% of the actual and potential equity investment in Metscan, and Leidy's total investment in Metscan is $1,261,000.
All Leidy's interest in Metscan will be transferred to Resources at book value. It is stated that Metscan developed
a low cost and efficient electronic automatic meter reading device (``AMD'') that provides an economical and efficient
method of reading residential natural gas utility meters. The AMD is a microprocessor that is affixed to a gas meter
and accumulates and stores information regarding natural gas usage by a customer and transmits it by telephone line
to a computer. This information is then available for billing purposes. It is stated that the Metscan system provides
the following benefits. (i) it improves meter reading efficiency, as accurate readings can be received electronically,
(ii) it enhances meter security and theft detection, because actual consumption data is phoned in monthly (or possibly
daily) and the AMD has a tamper alarm, and (iii) it enhances consumption monitoring by providing daily consumption
data. 

Resources also seeks authorization to: (i) Accept assignment from Leidy Hub of an agreement dated October 1, 1993,
between Enerop and Perfection Corporation, unaffiliated manufacturing company with its principal place of business
in Madison, Ohio (``Perfection Agreement''); and, (ii) undertake the obligations and rights under the Perfection
Agreement, including_(a) the obligation to make an investment in the aggregate amount of $610,000, and (b) the right
to receive a royalty (``Royalty'') of 3% of the net revenue from the sales of polyethylene ball valves (``Valves'')
for polyethylene fuel gas piping systems (``Perfection Valve Development Program''). The Perfection Agreement
covers three separate valve research and development programs: (i) the 11/4
'
' Program, (ii) the 2
'
' Program, and (iii) the 3-4-6
'
' Program. Enerop invested $125,000 in the 11/4
'
' Program and $85,000 in the 2
'
' Program. These programs have been rolled up into the Perfection Agreement along with the new 3-4-6
'
' Program. It is anticipated that the Valves will be marketed and sold throughout the United States with a significant
percentage of such sales occurring within National's system.

It is stated that plastic piping has been shown to be superior to traditional metal piping in regard to durability,
leak resistance and ease of installation. It is anticipated that the various plastic Valves developed as a result
of the Perfection Research and Development Program will also be superior to metal ones in these respects. Additionally,
it is anticipated that in many instances plastic Valves will be installed in a pipeline system that is otherwise already
all plastic. In such circumstances the need for cathodic protection will be eliminated. Distribution's consumers
will benefit from the development of these Valves because the utility will experience lower operations and maintenance
costs, thus helping to keep rates from rising.

It is stated that Leidy Hub is selling and assigning its interests in Metscan and the Perfection Agreement so that it
can focus on marketing hub activities. The entry by Leidy Hub into marketing hub activities is the subject of File No.

HEC, Inc. (70-8086)



HEC, Inc. (``HEC''), 24 Prime Parkway, Natick, Massachusetts, 01760, a non-utility subsidiary of Northeast Utilities
(``NU''), a registered holding company, has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10,
12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45, 86, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder.

HEC proposes to form and finance two new non-utility subsidiaries_HEC Energy Consulting Canada, Inc. (``HEC Canada'')
and HEC International Corporation (``HEC International''). HEC Canada would consult and provide energy management
and demand-side management services to utilities, government agencies and large energy consumers in Canada. HEC
International would be formed to participate, on a fifty-fifty basis, with a subsidiary of Barakat & Chamberlin,
Inc. (``BCI''), an unaffiliated company, in a joint venture_HECI, which would be a subsidiary company of HEC International.
HECI would consult and provide energy management and demand-side management services to utilities, government
agencies and large energy consumers in the western United States (Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho,
Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada and Arizona) and in foreign countries (except Canada).

With respect to HEC Canada, HEC seeks Commission authorization for (i) the organization of HEC Canada, within 120
days of Commission approval, under the laws of Ontario and of Canada, (ii) the issuance by HEC Canada, and the acquisition
by HEC, of 100 shares of common stock (no par value) for $10,000 (``HEC Canada Common Stock''), within 120 days of Commission
approval, (iii) the investment by HEC of up to $1.5 million in HEC Canada through June 30, 1996, and (iv) the provision
by HEC of administrative, engineering, and marketing services to HEC Canada through June 30, 1996. HEC would charge
HEC Canada the cost of administrative, engineering, and marketing services.

With respect to HECI, HEC seeks Commission authorization for (i) the organization of HEC International under the
laws of Massachusetts, (ii) the issuance by HEC International, and the acquisition by HEC, of 100 shares of common
stock (par value $1) for $10,000 (``HEC International Common Stock''), (iii) the formation of HECI within 120 days
of Commission approval, and (iv) the investment by HEC of up to $2.5 million in HEC International, for the purpose of
funding HECI, through June 30, 1996, and (v) the provision by HEC of administrative, engineering, and marketing services
to HEC International and to HECI through June 30, 1996.

By order dated July 27, 1990 (HCAR No. 25114-A) (``1990 Order''), the Commission authorized HEC to provide energy
management services to customers in New England and New York (``Region'') and, to a limited extent, to customers outside
the Region. By order dated September 30, 1993 (HCAR No. 25900) (``1993 Order''), the Commission authorized HEC to
provide additional energy management and demand-side management (``DSM'') services and to consult. The 1993 Order
authorized NU to make capital contributions to HEC of up to $6 million through June 30, 1996. By Order dated June 25,
1993 (HCAR No. 25836) (``Money Pool Order''), the Commission authorized HEC to borrow up to $11 million through December
31, 1994.

The 1993 Order authorized HEC to provide energy management and DSM services without limitation to customers within
the Region and, to a limited extent, to customers outside the Region subject to the requirement that the revenues from
the former not exceed the revenues from the latter (``Fifty-Percent Standard''). The 1993 Order imposed no restriction
on revenues from consulting services.

HEC Canada and HECI would provide energy management and DSM services outside the Region. The application-declaration
proposes, however, that the Fifty-Percent Standard be applicable to the revenues, from energy management and DSM
services, of HEC combined with those of HEC Canada and one-half of those of HECI. HEC proposes that there be no restriction
on revenues of HEC Canada and HECI from consulting services. The definitions of energy management services, DSM services,
and consulting services used in the application-declaration are consistent with the definitions of energy management
services, DSM services, and consulting services used in the 1993 Order. Pursuant to terms and conditions discussed
in the 1993 Order, HEC Canada and HECI also would design and market Intellectual Property, the definition of which
is consistent with that used in the 1993 Order.

With respect to HEC Canada, HEC would advance monies needed by HEC Canada to operate through June 30, 1996. The investments
by HEC in HEC Canada, which would not exceed $1.5 million would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock,
capital contributions, open account advances and/or subordinated loans. The source of those investments would
include internal funds and loans through the Money Pool. The interest rate on open account advances and subordinated
loans to HEC Canada would equal the interest rate in effect on HEC's loans through the Money Pool. The maximum term of
such loans would not exceed five years and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. However, to the extent
that the advances and/or loans are HEC loans through the Money Pool, the term and maturity date of such advances and/or
loans would equal those of the loans through the Money Pool.

With respect to HECI, HEC would advance monies needed by HEC International for its one-half share of HECI costs. The
investments by HEC in HEC International would take the form of additional acquisitions of common stock, capital contributions,
open account advances and/or subordinated loans. The sources of those investments would include internal funds
and loans through the Money Pool. The interest rate on open account advances and subordinated loans to HEC International
would equal the interest rate on HEC's loans through the Money Pool. The maximum term of such loans would not exceed
five years and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. However, to the extent that the advances and/or
loans are HEC loans through the Money Pool, the term and maturity date of such advances and/or loans would equal those
of the loans through the Money Pool. The investments by HEC in HEC International and other financial, performance
or contractual guarantees by HEC to HECI will not exceed either $2.5 million or one-half of its total costs.

On March 10, 1993, HEC and BCI, which is based in Oakland, California and which provides economic and management consulting
services to utilities and energy companies, signed a letter of intent for the formation, upon Commission approval,
of HECI under the laws of California. BCI and HEC International would each fund one-half of the expenses for HECI in
the form of open account advances through June 30, 1996. The interest on these advances would equal the interest rate
on loans or advances to HEC International from HEC. The maximum term of advances to HECI would not exceed five years
and the maturity date would be no later than June 30, 2001. Advances and direct payments by HEC International to HECI
and other costs associated with HECI would not exceed $2.5 million.

HECI proposes to enter into an agreement with HEC and BCI to subcontract for services at cost. This agreement would
prohibit HEC and BCI competition with HECI. Except for some retained earnings in HECI, all of its profits, after repayment
to HEC International and BCI for their respective contributions, advances and loans, would be split on a fifty-fifty
basis between HEC International and BCI. The management committee of HECI will consist of a representative of BCI,
a representative of HEC International and the HECI manager.

HECI activities might result in projects that require investments by one or both of the participants in the form of
additional loans to HECI. In that event, the participant will be paid an interest rate and fees that reflect the risk
of the investment. Such loans will be project-specific and depend on revenues generated by the project for payment
of interest and principal. The interest rate on such loans would not exceed 17%. The term for these loans would not exceed
three years, and the maturity date for such loans would be no later than June 30, 1999. Profits after the return of capital
and interest and fees will accrue to HECI. Such loans by HEC International and/or BCI to HECI each would be subject to
the overall aggregate limitation of $2.5 million.

HECI might also subcontract with HEC for construction and engineering services, financing, performance and other
contractual guarantees. The maximum commitment and/or exposure of HEC in this regard would be considered a contribution
from HEC to HECI and would be subject to the overall aggregate limitation on such contributions of $2.5 million.



Central and South West Corporation, et al. (70-8269)



Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, its nonutility subsidiary companies
CSW Energy, Inc. (``Energy'') and CSW Development-I, Inc. (``Energy Sub''), all located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers
Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202, and Ark/CSW Development Partnership (``Joint Venture'') (collectively,
``Applicants''), 23046 Avenida De Carlotta, Laguna Hills, California 92653, have filed an application-declaration
under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 13(b) of the Act and rules 45, 51, 87, 90, and 91 thereunder.

Energy Sub proposes to acquire up to 100% of the common stock of Sacramento Power, Inc. (``Project Venture''), a Delaware
corporation engaged in the development, construction, operation, and maintenance, and possible ownership of,
an independent energy facility known as the Sacramento Power Cogeneration Project (``Project'') to be located in
or near Sacramento, California, The Project will be a 148.5 megawatt, gas-fired qualifying cogeneration facility
or an exempt wholesale generator, as defined in section 32 of the Act.

Currently, two individuals, Arnold R. Klann and Leslie C. Confair, are equal owners of all of the 500 shares of common
stock, no par value, of Project Venture. Energy Sub will acquire 500 shares of new common stock, no par value, that are
to be issued by the Project Venture and may acquire up to 100% of the shares currently owned by Klann and Confair, for
$1 per share or an aggregate amount of up to $1,000.

The Project Venture may be reorganized as a limited liability company under Nevada, Texas or California law. Accordingly,
the Applicants propose to purchase the securities of the Project Venture or exchange any shares held at the time of
such reorganization, as appropriate, in the event it is reorganized. The total purchase price paid by Energy Sub for
the reorganized Project Venture would not exceed $1,000.

The Project Venture and Joint Venture have entered into a development agreement (``Development Agreement'') with
the Sacramento Municipal District Financing Authority (``Municipal Authority''), a public agency established
by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. Under the Development Agreement, the Joint Venture and Project Venture
are to provide services to the Project in two phases: Development (``Phase I'') and construction (``Phase II'').
 Joint Venture will perform services only in Phase I. The Project Venture is obligated to enter into an engineering,
procurement and construction agreement with a nationally recognized engineering and construction firm. The Project
Venture proposes to enter into such an agreement with The Babcock & Wilcox Company.





During Phase I, the Municipal Authority may terminate the Development Agreement for its own convenience or as a result
of a default by the Joint Venture or the Project Venture under the Development Agreement. However, if the Municipal
Authority terminates the Development Agreement for reasons unrelated to a default by the Project Venture, for example
for its own convenience or where it is in default under the Development Agreement, the Project Venture has the option
(``Option'') to terminate its involvement in the Project or, alternatively, to retain all Project assets and assume
all of the Municipal Authority's rights in and to the Project, including the right to complete construction of the
Project and to own and operate the Project. Accordingly, the Applicants seek authority for Project Venture to exercise
the Option to retain the Project Assets, to complete construction of the Project as necessary and to own and operate
the Project. The exercise of the Option shall require no fee or other consideration.

Phase II of the Project, construction, would commence after the Municipal Authority has obtained third party construction
and term financing for the Project. After completion of construction and start-up of the Project, the Municipal Authority
will pay the Project Venture a ``base purchase price,'' based on the Project's actual electrical generation capacity,
of no less than $84,064,000 and no more than $111,751,500. In addition, the Municipal Authority will pay the Project
Venture $4.75 million for services rendered pursuant to the terms of a subordinated note in the same principal amount.
The Municipal Authority will execute and deliver the subordinated note to the Project Venture at the completion of
the Project. After start-up of the Project, the Project Venture will also provide operations and maintenance services
for the Project.

As of December 31, 1993, the Joint Venture has incurred development expenses of approximately $6.7 million.
 In order to fund future development expenses, Energy proposes to make capital contributions, loans or open account
advances of up to $15 million downstream, directly or indirectly, to Project Venture. All loans or open account advances
would bear interest at a rate per annum not in excess of the prime commercial lending rate as in effect from time to time
at Mellon Bank plus 4% and would have a final maturity not to exceed 25 years.





Finally, the Applicants seek authorization for CSW, Energy or the Joint Venture to obtain a long-term irrevocable
standby letter of credit in the amount of $2.9 million (``LOC'') to replace a letter of credit in the same amount currently
issued for the benefit of the Municipal Authority. The LOC ensures that the Project Venture will perform its obligations
under the Development Agreement. The Municipal Authority would continue to be the beneficiary of the LOC and CSW would
be the account party responsible for reimbursing the issuer for drawings made under the LOC. Fees under the LOC would
not exceed 1% per annum and the interest payable on the unreimbursed drawings under the LOC would not exceed the prime
rate of the issuer plus 4%.

General Public Utilities Corporation, et al. (70-8409)



General Public Utilities Corporation (``GPU''), 100 Interpace Parkway, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054, a registered
holding company, and its subsidiaries, Jersey Central Power & Light Company (``JCP&L''), 300 Madison Avenue,
Morristown, New Jersey 07960, Metropolitan Edison Company (``Met-Ed''), 2800 Pottsville Pike, Reading, Pennsylvania
19640, and Pennsylvania Electric Company (``Penelec''), 1001 Broad Street, Johnstown, Pennsylvania 15907, have
filed an application-declaration pursuant to sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 13(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and
86-95 thereunder.

GPU proposes to organize a new, wholly-owned subsidiary company to be known as GPU Generation Corporation (``GPUGC'').
GPUGC proposes to undertake responsibility for the operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of all non-nuclear
generation facilities owned and/or operated by JCP&L, Met-Ed and Penelec (collectively, ``Subsidiaries'').
GPUGC also proposes to undertake responsibility for the design, construction, start-up and testing of any new non-nuclear
generation facilities which the Subsidiaries may need in the future. In addition, GPUGC proposes to assume (subject
to obtaining the requisite consent of the station co-owners) the responsibilities of Penelec and JCP&L under
certain operating agreements under which they operate and maintain certain fossil fuel and hydroelectric generation
facilities (

i.e., 

the Keystone, Conemaugh and Homer City coal-fired facilities and the Yards Creek and Seneca pumped storage hydroelectric
facilities) each of which is jointly owned by a GPU company with one or more unaffiliated utilities. GPUGC's Board
of Directors will include the presidents of each of the Subsidiaries. Ownership of the generation facilities, however,
will remain unchanged so that each Subsidiary will continue to own the utility plant currently reflected on its respective
books, as well as any capital additions made to its respective facilities or other new generation investments made
at its request for its own account.

To implement this program, the Subsidiaries will enter into an operating agreement (``Operating Agreement'') with
GPUGC. In effect, the Subsidiaries will simply make use of the staff, facilities and other combined resources of GPUGC
(which, at least initially, will be largely derived from existing GPU system staff, facilities and resources) to
operate and maintain the same generation facilities in which the Subsidiaries presently have an interest. From time
to time, GPUGC may also employ others (who may or may not be present employees of the GPU system) and engage consultants
and contractors as needed for the discharge of its functions. It is also contemplated that certain general and administrative
functions and services, such as finance/treasury, accounting, internal auditing, legal, data processing, taxes,
insurance, human resources and environmental, will be performed for GPUGC at cost by GPU Service Corporation (``GPUGC'')
and/or one or more of the Subsidiaries. The services rendered by GPUSC will be furnished at cost, including reasonable
compensation for necessary capital, in compliance with Rule 91.

GPU will acquire for cash all of the 2,500 authorized shares of GPUGC's common stock, par value of $20, at a price of $20
per share or an aggregate consideration of $50,000. If necessary, GPU proposes to make open account advances to GPUGC
from time to time during the term of the Operating Agreement up to an aggregate amount of $1 million outstanding at any
time. Interest on such open account advances will accrue at a rate equal to the Citibank, N.A. base rate as in effect
from time to time.

Certain management and supervisory personnel presently employed by the Subsidiaries (and/or GPUSC) are expected
to be transferred to GPUGC. However, it is not expected that union employees of the Subsidiaries will initially be
transferred to GPUGC. Rather, such employees will continue to perform their services at and on behalf of the GPU system's
non-nuclear generation facilities as employees of the same entities within the GPU system with which they are currently
associated.



National Fuel Gas Company, et al. (70-8417)



National Fuel Gas Company (``NFG''), 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, a registered holding company,
and Leidy Hub, Inc. (``Leidy Hub''),
 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, a non-utility subsidiary of NFG, have filed an application-declaration
under Section 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 16 and 45 thereunder.





NFG and Leidy Hub propose that Leidy Hub acquire, for $500,000, an interest in a partnership (``Partnership'') with
Hub Services, Inc. (``Hub Services''), an unaffiliated company, and a subsidiary of Natural Gas Clearinghouse (``Clearinghouse'').
Leidy Hub proposes to borrow the $500,000 needed for the acquisition from the National Fuel System Money Pool (``Money
Pool''). Leidy Hub presently has the authority, pursuant to an order dated December 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25964), to borrow
up to $2.5 million from the Money Pool. Leidy Hub and Hub Services plan to form the Partnership in order to operate a natural
gas market area hub (``Hub''). The Hub will offer customers services relating to the transportation, storage, purchase,
sale, exchange and lending of natural gas in the Hub area.

NFG also proposes to act as guarantor, through December 31, 1998, of certain obligations of Leidy Hub and the Partnership
in an amount not to exceed $5 million at any one time. The guarantees will be made for an indefinite period of time not
to exceed four years. It is stated that the obligations of Leidy Hub and the Partnership to be guaranteed would be incurred
as a result of the activities undertaken by the Partnership related to the supply of natural gas as delineated in the
Gas Related Activities Act of 1990 (``GRAA''). It is anticipated that whenever the Partnership is required to provide
a guarantee, it will be provided one-half by NFG and one-half by Clearinghouse. Such guarantees include the guarantee
of obligations associated with: (1) Gas transportation agreements entered into by the Partnership with local distribution
companies or pipelines such as Distribution and Supply; (2) gas purchase and sale agreements entered into by the Partnership
in the provision of certain contemplated title transfer services; and (3) any and all other agreements relating to
the transportation, storage or supply of natural gas, as such activities are defined under the GRAA.

2. Under the Prior Order, the Funds may waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) Following the death or disability, as defined
in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''), of a shareholder if redemption is made within
one year after death or disability; (b) otherwise payable by employees participating in qualified or non-qualified
employee benefit plans or other programs where (i) the employers or affiliated employers maintaining such plans
or programs have a minimum of 250 employees eligible for participation in such plans or programs, or (ii) such plan's
or program's aggregate initial investment in the Security family of funds or other products made available through
the Distributor exceeds $1,000,000; and (c) in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred
retirement plan or attaining age 701/2 in the case of an IRA or Keogh plan or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)
of the Code.

3. Applicants seek to amend these waiver categories to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) Following
the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''), of a shareholder
if redemption is made within one year after death or disability; (b) in connection with required minimum distributions
in the case of an IRA, SAR-SEP or Keogh or any other retirement plan qualified under section 401(a), 401(k) or
403(b) of the Code; (c) in the case of distributions from retirement plans qualified under section 401(a) or 401(k)
of the Code due to (i) returns of excess contributions to the Plan, (ii) retirement of a participant in the plan, (iii)
a loan from the plan (repayment of loans, however, will constitute new sales for purposes of assessing the CDSC), (iv)
``financial headship'' of a participant in the plan, as that term is defined in Treasury Regulation section 1.401(k)-1(d)(2),
as amended from time to time, (v) termination of employment of a participant in the plan, and (vi) any other permissible
withdrawal under the terms of the plan; (d) in connection with redemptions by (i) directors, officers, and employees
of Security Benefit Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) agents licensed with Security Benefit Life
Insurance Company, (iii) spouses or minor children of any such agents, (iv) the spouses, grandparents, parents,
children, grandchildren, siblings, nieces, and nephews of the directors, officers, and employees (and their spouses)
listed in (i), and (v) any trust, pension, profit sharing or other benefit plan established by and of the foregoing
corporations for persons described above; (e) in connection with redemption of shares of the Funds pursuant to a systematic
withdrawal program; and (f) of Class A shares purchased in an amount of $1,000,000 or more if such redemption occurs
between 13 and 24 months of initial purchase.


4. If the directors of a Fund determine to discontinue the waiver of a CDSC or otherwise change the CDSC to the disadvantage
of shareholders, the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be revised appropriately. Any shares purchased prior
to the termination of such waiver or the implementation of a change to the CDSC that disadvantages shareholders will
have the CDSC and waivers applied as provided in the appropriate Fund's prospectus at the time the shares were purchased.



Applicants' Condition

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF STATE</USDEPT>






United States International Telecommunications Advisory Committee, Radiocommunication Sector, Study Group
1, Ad Hoc Group, Basic Automated Spectrum Management System (BASMS) For Developing Countries; Meeting Notice



The Department of State announces that the United States International Telecommunications Advisory Committee
(ITAC), Radiocommunication Sector, Study Group 1 Ad Hoc Group BASMS will meet on June 7, 1994, 9:30 am to 12 noon, in
room 1412, at the Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC.

In November 1993, the Radiocommunication Assembly of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) approved
a resolution calling for the rapid development of a computer software for BASMS and the necessary training to implement
this program in developing countries. The purpose of the BASMS program is to give developing countries a tool to efficiently
and effectively manage the radio spectrum and therefore to accelerate the development of wireless technology in
the country.

In March 1994, ITU Radiocommunication Study Group 1 approved a recommendation on the ``Design Guidelines for a Automated
Spectrum Management System (BASMS).'' The recommendation describes the software and hardware functional requirements
that should be used to develop BASMS.

The Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) of the ITU requested the U.S. (and other Administrations) to assist
the BDT in developing BASMS by distributing information about BASMS requirements to appropriate private companies
that are interested in developing this software.

It is important that (1) the software be developed at minimum cost since the BDT has limited resources and (2) that the
software be developed based on existing X based software to minimize cost and to develop the minimum time. The development
time should be less than five months from the award of the contract.

Proposals for the development of BASMS should be sent directly to the BDT by August 1, 1994. The award of the contract
will be held within two months of this date.

U.S. Radiocommunication Study Group 1, Ad Hoc Group BASMS will meet on June 7, 1994, to describe the technical specifications
for BASMS and to answer questions concerning the development of the software. Anyone planning to attend the meeting
should contact Robert J. Mayher by phone at (202) 482-1139 or by fax at (202) 482-4396.

<USDEPT>TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement; Shoreline Management Initiative</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Tennessee Valley Authority.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on alternatives for management
of TVA shoreline use associated with residential and other development adjacent to TVA reservoirs. It is envisioned
that the EIS will analyze a range of alternatives for managing shoreline development, define a system to categorize
shorelines, and determine permissible uses of shorelines. TVA reservoirs in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia are affected by this proposed EIS.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under section 26a of the TVA Act, any obstruction affecting navigation, flood control, or public lands on or along
the Tennessee River system requires review and approval by TVA. In addition, TVA has a variety of landrights along
TVA shorelines, ranging from the right to flood the land to fee ownership of the land. Requests to use public shoreline
land typically require approval by TVA. In a recent five-year period, TVA approved about 9,500 requests for private
docks, boathouses, retaining walls, riprap, landscaping, etc. along TVA shorelines.




For the purposes of this EIS, the TVA reservoir shoreline is defined as land lying below a contour elevation about 5
feet above the top of the gates at TVA dams. Lands and water below this elevation are generally subject to section 26a
jurisdiction.
Currently, 15 percent of the shoreline on TVA's reservoirs is developed for private use; however, some lakes such
as Wilson, Fort Loudoun, Chatuge, and Watts Bar, are much more highly developed. If current development trends continue,
it is estimated that these figures could increase dramatically, especially on those lakes that are near urban areas
or that have become resort destinations. The EIS will consider a variety of different approaches to shoreline management.


Proposed Issues To Be Addressed


The EIS will assess the consequences of establishing a system to categorize all 11,000 miles of TVA shorelines based
on environmental resources, land rights, physical site features, and operational characteristics of the reservoir
such as navigation and flood control. Permissible uses allowed in each shoreline category would be defined. Issues
to be addressed would include impacts of shoreline development on floodplains, wetlands, cultural resources, aesthetics,
riparian shoreline ecology, endangered and threatened species and sensitive habitat, water quality, aquatic resources,
reservoir operations, navigation, public use opportunities, and socioeconomic conditions. Examples of actions
potentially affected by this Initiative include:



_Floating and fixed docks.
_Storage lockers for water use equipment.
_Non-navigable houseboats.
_Floating and fixed boathouses.
_Mooring buoys or posts.
_Electric poles and overhead electric wires.
_Fences.
_Portable picnic tables, benches, and grills.
_Vegetation trimming, clearing, and landscaping.
_Boat launching ramps, marine railways, and associated driveways.
_Land-based shelters for storage of boats and accessories.
_Buried electrical and water lines.
_Rip-rap, retaining walls, and bioengineered shorelines stabilization.
_Terraces, patios, gazebos, steps, and walkways.
_Fills, grading, change of contours.
_Boat channels, harbors, recessed boat wells, and excavations.

Reservoirs Affected


Shoreline use on the following reservoirs will be addressed in the EIS:




Scoping Process


TVA is interested in receiving comments on the issues to be addressed above. TVA specifically requests comments on:



1. What is most important to you about TVA lakeshores?
2. What environmental issues or other aspects of shoreline use associated with residential development should TVA
include in this policy analysis?
3. What changes should be made in the way shorelines are protected, used, or developed?
4. Alternatives for shoreline management.



The EIS will address environmental issues and impacts raised in public scoping. Scoping meetings will be held from
7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at the following dates and locations:

Persons interested in attending or receiving more information should call 1-800-TVA-LAND prior
to the meeting to confirm the time and location.
Based on the scoping comments, TVA will develop a range of alternatives for shoreline management to be assessed in
the EIS. A decision analysis process will be used to further refine and analyze the alternatives as part of the EIS process.
Following analysis of the environmental consequences of each alternative, TVA will prepare a Draft EIS for public
review and comment. Notice of the availability of this draft will be announced, comments on the draft solicited, and
information about additional public meetings/hearings will be published at a future date. TVA contemplates releasing
a final EIS in late 1995.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces determinations, under Notice 
89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) will be modified to include di-n-hexyl adipate, 
ortho-dichlorobenzene, and para-dichlorobenzene. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines 
that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the 
weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the 
materials used to produce such substance. This determination 
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of 
production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the 
rules relating to the determination process. 



Determination 



On May 23, 1994, the Secretary determined that di-n-hexyl 
adipate, ortho-dichlorobenzene, and para-dichlorobenzene 
should be added to the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3), effective October 1, 1990. 

The rate of tax prescribed for di-n-hexyl adipate, under 
section 4671(b)(3), is $4.67 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for ethylene of 0.58, a conversion factor 
for methane of 0.05, a conversion factor for benzene of 0.33, 
and a conversion factor for nitric acid of 0.29. 

The rate of tax prescribed for ortho-dichlorobenzene, 
under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.55 per ton. This is based 
upon a conversion factor for benzene of 0.57 and a conversion 
factor for chlorine of 1.03. 

The rate of tax prescribed for para-dichlorobenzene, under 
section 4671(b)(3), is $5.55 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for benzene of 0.57 and a conversion factor 
for chlorine of 1.03. 

The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and 
exporter of these substances. No material comments were 
received on these petitions. The following information is 
the basis for the determinations. 



Di-n-hexyl adipate 



HTS number: 2917.39.20.00 

CAS number: 110-33-8

 


Di-n-hexyl adipate is derived from the taxable chemicals 
ethylene, methane, benzene, and nitric acid. Di-n-hexyl 
adipate is a liquid produced predominantly by reaction of 
n-hexyl alcohol with adipic acid in the presence of a 
catalyst. N-hexyl alcohol is produced from aluminum, natural 
gas (via hydrogen), and ethylene (via triethylaluminum). 
Oxidation of the intermediate mixed trialkylaluminum with air 
produces a mixed aluminum alkoxide, which is hydrolyzed to 
produce a mixture of alcohols, from which n-hexyl alcohol is 
recovered by distillation. Adipic acid is produced from 
benzene (via cyclohexane) and the methane in natural gas (via 
hydrogen). Oxidation of cyclohexane using air and nitric 
acid in a two-step process produces adipic acid. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula di-n-hexyl 
adipate is:

 


6 C

 (methane) + C

6

Di-n-hexyl adipate has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 76.6 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.

Ortho-dichlorobenzene 



HTS number: 2903.61.20.00 

CAS number: 95-50-1

 


Ortho-dichlorobenzene is derived from the taxable 
chemicals benzene and chlorine. Ortho-dichlorobenzene is a 
liquid produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine 
with benzene. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula 
ortho-dichlorobenzene is:

Ortho-dichlorobenzene has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production. 



Para-dichlorobenzene 



HTS number: 2903.61.30.00 

CAS number: 106-46-7

 


Para-dichlorobenzene is derived from the taxable chemicals 
benzene and chlorine. Para-dichlorobenzene is a solid 
produced predominantly by the reaction of chlorine with 
benzene. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
para-dichlorobenzene is:

sulfuric acid. Para-nitrophenol is a solid produced 
predominantly by the reaction of para-nitrochlorobenzene with 
aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by reaction with sulfuric 
acid to form para-nitrophenol from the resulting 
para-nitrophenoxide. 

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for para-nitrophenol is:

Para-nitrophenol has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 100 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production. 



Ortho-nitrochlorobenzene

<DOCTITLE>Tax on Certain Imported Substances; Filing of Petition </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 
89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, of a petition requesting that texanol 
benzyl phthalate be added to the list of taxable substances 
in section 4672(a)(3). Publication of this notice is in 
compliance with Notice 89-61. This is not a determination 
that the list of taxable substances should be modified.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The petition was received on 
June 29, 1993. The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a 
manufacturer and exporter of this substance. The following 
is a summary of the information contained in the petition. 
The complete petition is available in the Internal Revenue 
Service Freedom of Information Reading Room.

 

HTS number: 3812.20.00.00 
CAS number: 16883-83-3.

 

This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals 
xylene, toluene, chlorine, methane, propylene, and sodium 
hydroxide. Texanol benzyl phthalate is a liquid produced 
predominantly by the reaction of texanol (2,2,4-trimethyl-1, 
3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate) and phthalic anhydride to 
produce a monoester, the sodium salt of which (produced by 
reaction with sodium hydroxide) is reacted with benzyl 
chloride. 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this 
substance is: 


C

O (water)

 

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 
80.8 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this 
substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.79 
per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for 
xylene of 0.28, a conversion factor for toluene of 0.24, a 
conversion factor for chlorine of 0.19, a conversion factor 
for methane of 0.17, a conversion factor for propylene of 
0.44, and a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.09. 


Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing 


Before a determination is made, consideration will be 
given to any written comments (a signed original and eight 
(8) copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All 
comments will be available for public inspection and copying. 
A public hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by 
a person that timely submits written comments. If a public 
hearing is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for 
the hearing will be published in the

I. Purpose and Substantive Description


A. Authority and Background


1. Authority


Title I, Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301-5320); 24 CFR part 570, subpart F.


2. Background


Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 authorizes the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
Program. Section 106 of Title I permits the States to elect to assume the administrative responsibility for the CDBG
Program for nonentitled areas within their jurisdiction. Section 106 provides that HUD will administer the CDBG
Program for nonentitled areas within any State that does not elect to assume the administrative responsibility for
the program. Subpart F of 24 CFR part 570 sets out the requirements for HUD's administration of the CDBG Program in nonentitled
areas (Small Cities Program). This NOFA supplements subpart F of 24 CFR part 570, which sets out the requirements applicable
to the CDBG Program in nonentitled areas.

<DOCNO> FR940527-2-00198 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-2-00152 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In accordance with 24 CFR 570.420(e) and 570.420(h)(3), and with the requirements of section 102 of the Housing and
Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act), HUD is issuing this NOFA for New York State's Small Cities Program
for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 to announce the allocation of funds for Single Purpose and Comprehensive grants, and to establish
the deadline for filing grant applications. The NOFA explains how HUD will apply the regulatory threshold requirements
for funding eligibility, and the selection criteria for rating and scoring applications for Comprehensive grants
and for scoring projects in applications for Single Purpose grants. 


Section I.A.3 of this NOFA provides a description of certain statutory amendments that apply to the HUD-Administered
Small Cities Program, even though conforming regulations have not yet been adopted. The statutory amendments listed
in Section I.A.3 require little or no regulatory elaboration. Conforming amendments will be made to 24 CFR part 570,
subpart F in future rulemaking. Other information about the Small Cities Program will be provided in the application
kit, which will be made available to applicants by HUD's New York and Buffalo Offices. 



3. Statutory Changes



Both the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101-625, approved November 28, 1990) (NAHA) and the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act) amended Title
I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the HCD Act). Various amendments made by the two recent statutes
are applicable, as described below, to the funds made available under this NOFA. 

a. 

Principal Benefit Certification.

 NAHA amended section 101(c) of the HCD Act to require that at least 70 percent of the CDBG assistance provided over a
specified period must be used for activities that principally benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Applicants
must certify that CDBG assistance will be used as required by the amended section 101(c). The principal benefit certification
has been revised to incorporate this change from 60 percent to 70 percent. 

b. 

Program Income.

 In determining the applicability of CDBG requirements to the use of program income, section 804 of the 1992 Act removes
any consideration of whether the grantee is still participating in the CDBG program. This means that program income
generated from projects funded in FY 1993 and thereafter will always be subject to all of the CDBG requirements. 

c. 

Microenterprise and Small Business Development.

 Section 807(c) of the 1992 Act defines a ``small business'' as one that meets the criteria set forth in section 3(a)
of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)), and defines a ``microenterprise'' as a commercial enterprise having
five or fewer employees, one or more of whom own the enterprise. 

Additionally, section 807(c) of the 1992 Act provides that in the provision of assistance under  570.203(b)
to for-profit microenterprises and small businesses, HUD will not consider the use of CDBG funds for training, technical
assistance, and other support costs provided to such entities to be planning or administrative costs. 

(Section 807(c) also directs HUD not to consider CDBG funds as being used for a planning or administrative activity
when the funds are used to pay costs to develop the capacity of the grantee (or a subrecipient) to provide training,
technical assistance or other support services to small businesses or microenterprises. Consequently_since these
activities are not to be considered as planning or administrative activities_they 

are

 subject to compliance with the national objective requirements.) 


d. 

Lump Sum Drawdowns.

 The use of lump sum drawdowns for residential rehabilitation has been re-authorized for CDBG funds appropriated
after Fiscal Year 1992. 

e. 

Eligible Activities

_(1) 

Changes Affecting Existing Categories_(a) Assistance to For-Profit Businesses.

 Section 806(b) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a) of the HCD Act so that CDBG assistance provided to for-profit businesses
is not limited to activities for which no other forms of assistance are available, or to activities that could not be
accomplished, but for that assistance. 

(b) 

Direct Homeownership Assistance.

 NAHA amended section 105(a) of the HCD Act to provide that CDBG funds can be used to provide direct assistance to facilitate
and expand homeownership among persons of low- and moderate-income. Under this provision, CDBG funds may be used
to: subsidize interest rates and mortgage principal amounts for low- and moderate-income homebuyers; finance the
acquisition by low- and moderate-income homebuyers of housing that is occupied by the homebuyers; acquire guarantees
for mortgage financing obtained by low- and moderate-income homebuyers from private lenders (except that assistance
under Title I of the HCD Act may not be used by recipients or subrecipients to guarantee mortgage financing directly);
provide up to 50 percent of the downpayment required from low- and moderate-income buyers; and pay reasonable closing
costs normally associated with the purchase of a home incurred by a low- and moderate-income homebuyer. While this
provision was set to expire on October 1, 1993, it has been extended to October 1, 1994 by section 807(b) of the 1992 Act.
Under the terms of this provision, the locality must commit funds to a specific homeowner prior to October 1, 1994.
It is extremely likely that this provision will be extended until October 1, 1995. Applications will be rated assuming
that the extension will be granted. 

(c) 

Code Enforcement.

 Section 807(e) of the 1992 Act adds ``private improvements or services'' undertaken in an area to the list of activities
that may be considered, together with code enforcement, in determining whether CDBG funds may be used to pay for the
code enforcement in an area.

(d) 

Loans to Subrecipients.

 Section 807(d) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a)(14) of the HCD Act to authorize the use of CDBG assistance for activities
in the form of loans_both interim and long-term_as well as grants. 

(e) 

Public Service Cap.

 NAHA amended section 105(a)(8) of the HCD Act by placing the 15 percent cap for public services on each State's total
nonentitlement CDBG allocation, plus 15 percent of program income anticipated to be received in the fiscal year.
(Previously, the 15 percent cap for public services was applied to each recipient's grant.) As a result of this provision,
HUD may award a grant to a recipient for public service activities with 100 percent of the funds spent for public service
activities. However, any application requesting funds for public service activities must be ratable under one of
the existing Single Purpose or the Comprehensive grant categories. HUD will apply the 15 percent statewide cap to
public service activities by funding public service activities in the highest-rated applications until the cap
is reached. 

(f) 

Neighborhood-Based Nonprofit Organizations.

 Section 807(f) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a)(15) of the HCD Act to add nonprofit organizations serving the
development needs of communities in nonentitlement areas as entities eligible to carry out CDBG activities. 

(2) 

New Categories of Eligible Activities_(a) Nonprofit Capacity Building.

 Section 807(a)(4) makes eligible the provision of technical assistance to public or nonprofit entities to increase
the capacity of these entities to carry out eligible neighborhood revitalization or economic development activities.
Section 807(a)(4) makes clear, however, that the use of funds for technical assistance is 

not

 to be considered as a planning or administrative cost of the program. Before the amendment, the use of CDBG funds for
nonprofit capacity building was an eligible activity only under  570.205, and therefore was subject to the
cap on planning and administration set out at  570.200(g). While nonprofit capacity building is now eligible
under the new provision and is not subject to a percentage limitation, it should be noted that any such use of funds under
the new authority must be shown to meet one of the national objectives. (This may be difficult in some cases, since all
activities carried out by the nonprofit using the added capacity will need to be considered for that purpose.) 

(b) 

Institutions of Higher Education.

 Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act makes it possible for a grantee to provide CDBG funds to institutions of higher education
to carry out activities otherwise eligible for CDBG assistance, provided that it can be determined that the institution
has demonstrated a capability to carry out such activities. 

(c) 

Acquisition by Tax Foreclosure.

 Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act makes eligible the use of CDBG funds to make essential repairs and to pay operating
expenses necessary to maintain the habitability of housing units acquired through tax foreclosure proceedings
in order to prevent abandonment and deterioration of housing in primarily low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.


(d) 

Microenterprises.

 Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act establishes a new category of eligibility under which CDBG funds may be used to provide
assistance to public and private organizations, agencies, and other entities (including nonprofit and for-profit
entities) to enable these entities to facilitate economic development by:




 Providing credit (including providing direct loans and loan guarantees, establishing revolving loan funds,
and facilitating peer lending programs) for the establishment, stabilization, and expansion of microenterprises;


 Providing technical assistance, advice, and business support services (including assistance, advice,
and support relating to developing business plans, securing funding, conducting marketing, and otherwise engaging
in microenterprise activities) to owners of microenterprises and persons developing microenterprises; and 

 Providing general support (such as peer support programs and counseling) to the owners of microenterprises
and to persons developing microenterprises. 



(e) 

Housing Services.

 Section 807(a)(4) of the 1992 Act establishes a new category of eligibility for ``housing services''. Housing services
include housing counseling, energy auditing, preparation of work specifications, loan processing, inspections,
tenant selection, management of tenant-based rental assistance, and other services related to assisting owners,
tenants, contractors, and other entities, participating or seeking to participate in housing activities authorized
under the CDBG program or the HOME program. Activities that are carried out under this provision are to be subject to
the 20 percent limitation on administrative expenses. 

It is important to note that these activities are currently eligible in the CDBG program when carried out in conjunction
with rehabilitation (see 24 CFR 570.202(b)(9)), and therefore not subject to the administrative cap on expenditures.


(f) 

Lead-Based Paint Hazards.

 Section 1012 of the 1992 Act amends section 105(a) by stating that CDBG funds may be used for lead-based paint hazard
evaluation and reduction, as defined in section 1004 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of
1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851). It should be noted that  570.202(a)(iv) currently authorizes inspection and abatement
of lead-based paint in conjunction with CDBG-assisted rehabilitation. Additionally,  570.205 authorizes
evaluation of lead-based paint hazards within the jurisdiction generally. Until the regulations are modified to
incorporate this new provision, grantees may use the new authority to fund lead-based paint inspection of houses
whether or not rehabilitation of the houses will be CDBG-funded. The new authority may also be used to fund large scale
evaluation of lead based-paint hazards in the community (assuming that it is an approved activity in the Small Cities
application), outside of the 20 percent limitation on planning and administration cost, if the grantee can demonstrate
that the evaluation addresses a CDBG national objective.

(3) 

Changes concerning national objectives_(a) Low/mod jobs presumption.

 Section 806(e) of the 1992 Act amends section 105(c) of the HCD Act by adding a new paragraph (4) which states that, for
purposes of determining whether an activity involves the employment of persons the majority of whom are low- and moderate-income
persons, a person may be presumed to be a low- and moderate-income person in either of the following circumstances:




 If the employee resides in, or the assisted activity through which he or she is employed, is located in a census
tract that meets the Federal enterprise zone eligibility criteria; or 
 The employee resides in a census tract where not less than 70 percent of the residents are low- and moderate-income
persons. 



The provision of new paragraph (4) concerning the percentage of low- and moderate-income persons residing in a census
tract was effective upon enactment. However, because existing HUD regulations do not clearly apply enterprise zone
criteria to census tracts, the portion of new paragraph (4) concerning census tracts that meet the Federal enterprise
zone eligibility criteria will not become effective until regulations are established identifying the specific
criteria that must be met. 


f. 

Housing Strategies. 

Any applicant which plans to undertake a housing activity with Fiscal Year 1994 funds under the HUD-administered
Small Cities Program must prepare and submit a comprehensive housing affordability strategy (CHAS) to be eligible
to apply for such assistance. In order to receive funding if the Small Cities application is approved, the housing
strategy must be approved by HUD. Further, any Small Cities application for which a housing strategy is required must
include a certification that the application is consistent with the housing strategy. 
Current CHAS regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 1, 1992, at 57 FR 40038, as amended, in part, on March 12, 1993 at 58 FR 13686. These regulations are codified
in 24 CFR part 91. Applicants under this NOFA are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in  91.25
of the CHAS regulations. Applicants are advised to begin preparation of the abbreviated strategy at the earliest
possible time in order to have sufficient time to fulfill the applicable citizen participation requirements, which
provide that the strategy must be available to the public for at least thirty days before its submission to HUD. 
If possible, applicants should endeavor to submit the abbreviated strategy in advance of the Small Cities application
due date. The latest time at which the abbreviated strategy will be accepted by HUD for the HUD-administered Small
Cities Program in New York will be the application due date for the Small Cities application. Failure to submit the
abbreviated strategy by the due date is not a curable technical deficiency. Questions regarding the housing strategies
should be directed to the appropriate HUD field office. Complete Small Cities applications for which the abbreviated
strategy has been submitted but not yet approved will still be rated and ranked with the other applications; if determined
to be fundable, those applications will receive a conditional approval subject to approval of the abbreviated strategy.
However, such an approval will be rescinded if the abbreviated strategy has not been approved by HUD within 60 days
from the date that the conditional approval has been announced. In such event the funding will be awarded to the highest
rated fundable applicant that did not receive funding under this competition. 
g. 

Section 3. 

Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 was amended substantially by section 915 of the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1992, and the issuance of regulations to implement the new requirements was mandated.
The following policy was set forth in the statute: ``It is * * * the purpose of this section to ensure
that the employment and other economic opportunities generated by Federal financial assistance for housing and
community development programs shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be directed toward low- and very low-income
persons * * * '' 
HUD published a proposed rule October 8, 1993 (24 CFR part 135) with a public comment period extended to December 8,
1993. Upon publication of the interim rule, requirements (including reporting requirements) relative to section
3 (for the purpose of determining the effectiveness of section 3) will be applicable to the HUD-administered Small
Cities Program. At the time of publication of the interim rule, HUD will provide further information and instructions
to applicants concerning the requirements of section 3. 
4. Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient
Disclosures. HUD has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by HUD. (See also Section II.D. of this NOFA.) On January 16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional
information that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information
on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public access, and applicant and recipient disclosure
requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 
a. 

HUD responsibilities

_(1) 

Documentation and public access. 

HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 
(2) 

Disclosures. 

HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 
b. 

Units of General Local Government Responsibilities. 

Units of general local government awarded assistance under this NOFA are subject to the provisions of either paragraph
b(1), or paragraph (b)(2) and (b)(3). For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA which in turn
make the assistance available on a non-competitive basis for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraph
b(1) applies. For units of local government awarded assistance under this NOFA, which in turn make the assistance
available on a competitive basis for a specific project or activity to a subrecipient, paragraphs b(2) and (3) apply.

(1) 

Disclosures. 

The units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant disclosure reports
available to the public for three years. Required update reports must be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local government may use HUD Form 2880
to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR 12 subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.)

(2) 

Documentation and Public Access. 

The recipient unit of general local government must ensure that documentation and other information regarding each
application submitted to the recipient by a subrecipient applicant are adequate to indicate the basis upon which
assistance was provided or denied. The unit of general local government must make this material, including any letters
of support, available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award
of the assistance. Unit of general local government recipients must also notify the public of the subrecipients of
the assistance. Each recipient will develop documentation, public access, and notification procedures for its
programs. (See 24 CFR 12.14(b) and 12.16(c), and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for more information on these documentation and public access requirements.) 
(3) 

Disclosures. 

Units of general local government receiving assistance under this NOFA must make all applicant disclosure reports
available to the public for five years. Required update reports must be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. Each unit of general local government may use HUD Form 2880
to collect the disclosures, or may develop its own form. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942) for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 


B. Allocation Amounts


1. Total Available Funding and Allocation


The nonentitlement CDBG funds for New York State for FY 1994 total $50,616,000 and will be allocated as follows: 
a. 

Buffalo Office. 

$44,438,000 is allocated for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction
of HUD's Buffalo Office. Maximum grant amounts for units of general local government under the jurisdiction of the
Buffalo Office will be $400,000 for Single Purpose grant applications and $900,000 for Comprehensive grant applications,
except that counties may apply for up to $600,000 in Single Purpose funds. The maximum amount for Single Purpose grant
applications made jointly by units of general local government will be $600,000. 
b. 

New York Office. 

$6,178,000 is allocated for distribution to eligible units of general local government within the jurisdiction
of HUD's New York Office. Maximum grant amounts for communities under the jurisdiction of the New York Office will
be $400,000 for Single Purpose grants and $750,000 for Comprehensive grants, except that counties may apply for up
to $600,000 in Single Purpose funds. The maximum amount for Single Purpose grant applications made jointly by units
of general local government will be $600,000. 


2. Distribution of Funds Between Single Purpose and Comprehensive Grants 

Generally, 85 percent of the funds allocated separately to the New York and Buffalo offices shall be for Single Purpose
grants with the remaining 15 percent to be reserved for Comprehensive grants. However, in order to assure a competitive
distribution of funds, each HUD office has the option to revise the division of funds between Single Purpose and Comprehensive
grants to as low as 75 percent for Single Purpose and up to 25 percent for Comprehensive grants. Applicants requesting
more that $600,000 in Comprehensive funding will be expected to provide clear and convincing evidence that the proposed
activities will effectively address and correct conditions affecting large segments of the low- and moderate-income
community, and that the grantee has the capability to expend the funds in a timely fashion. If this is not provided,
the field office may reduce the grant amount. 


3. Imminent Threats


The criteria for grants to alleviate or remove imminent threats to health or safety that require an immediate solution
are described at  570.432. All imminent threat projects must meet the national objective of benefitting low-
and moderate-income persons. For FY 1994, $6,665,700 is being set aside in the Buffalo Office, and $926,700 is being
set aside in the New York Office for imminent threat projects. These funds will be available in each office until the
office completes the rating and ranking process for funds distributed under this NOFA. 


C. Eligibility


1. Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are units of general local government in New York State, excluding: metropolitan cities, urban
counties, units of government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities even if only part
of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city, and Indian tribes eligible
for 
assistance under section 106 of the HCD Act. Applications may be submitted individually or jointly. 


2. Previous Grantees


Eligible applicants, which previously have been awarded Small Cities Program CDBG grants, are also subject to an
evaluation of capacity and performance. Numerical thresholds for drawdown of funds have been established to assist
HUD in evaluating a grantee's progress in implementing its program activities. (These standards apply to all CDBG
Program grants received by the community.) An additional threshold relates to the submission of annual Performance
Assessment Reports (PARs) which are due annually for each grant which a local government has received. Failure to
submit a PAR is not a curable technical deficiency. Applicants generally will be determined to have performed adequately
in the area(s) where the thresholds are met. Where a threshold has not been met, HUD will evaluate the documentation
of any mitigating factors, particularly with respect to actions taken by the applicant to accelerate the implementation
of its program activities. 


3. Eligible Activities and National Objectives


Eligible activities under the Small Cities CDBG Program are those identified in subpart C of 
24 CFR part 570. Each activity must meet one of the national objectives (i.e. benefit to low- and moderate-income persons,
elimination of slums or blighting conditions, or meeting imminent threats to the health and safety of the community),
and each grant must meet the requirements for compliance with the primary objective of principally benefitting low-
and moderate-income persons, as required under the provisions of  570.200(a) (2) and (3) and  570.208,
which supersede  570.420(h)(2). As described in Section I.A.3.a. of this NOFA, the principal benefit requirement
was increased by NAHA from 60 to 70 percent. The method of calculating the use of these funds for compliance with the
70 percent overall benefit requirement is set forth in  570.200(a)(3) (i) through (v). 


4. Environmental Review Requirement


The HUD environmental review procedures contained in 24 CFR part 58 apply to this program. Under part 58, grantees
assume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decision-making and action pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the other provisions of law specified by the Secretary in 24 CFR part 58 that would
apply to the Secretary were he to undertake such projects as Federal projects. 


D. Types of Grants


1. Comprehensive Grants


a. 

General. 

Comprehensive grants are available to fund projects which meet the following criteria: 
(1) Address a substantial portion of the identified community development needs within a defined area or areas; 
(2) Involve two or more activities related to each other that will be carried out in a coordinated manner; 
(3) Have a beneficial impact within a reasonable period of time. 
HUD may make an exception to the requirement that all activities must be carried out in a defined area or areas if the
applicant can demonstrate that the comprehensive strategy is a reasonable means of addressing identified needs.

If an application for a Comprehensive grant does not meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Grant Program, HUD
will rate the proposal as a Single Purpose grant.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-2-00202 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-2-00152 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. 

Funding requirements.

 The total amount of funds requested for a Comprehensive grant must be within the established ceilings. Grant ceilings
for each of the administering offices are indicated in Section I.B.1 of this NOFA. Grant funds requested must be sufficient,
either by themselves or in combination with funds from other sources, to complete the project within a reasonable
amount of time. If other sources of funds are to be used with 
respect to a project, the source of those funds must be identified and the level of commitment indicated. 



2. Single Purpose Grants



a. 

General.

 Single Purpose grants are designed to address and resolve a specific community development need. A Single Purpose
grant may consist of more than one project. A project may consist of one activity or a set of activities. Each project
must address community development needs in one of the following problem areas: 




_Housing 

_Public Facilities 

_Economic Development




Each project will be rated against all other projects addressing the same problem area, according to the criteria
outlined below. It should be noted that each project within an application will be given a separate impact 
rating, if each one is clearly designated by the applicant as a separate and distinct project (i.e. separate Needs
Description, Community Development 
Activities, Impact Description and Program Schedule forms have been filled out, indicating project names). In some
cases, it may be to the applicant's advantage to designate separate projects for activities that can ``stand on their
own'' in terms of meeting the described need, especially where a particular project would tend to weaken the impact
rating of the other activities, if they were rated as a whole, as has been the case with some economic development and
housing projects. If, however, the projects tend to meet impact criteria to the same extent, or the weaker element
is only a small portion of the overall project, there is no discernable benefit in designating separate projects.


b. 

Funding requirements.

 The total amount of funds requested for a Single Purpose grant must be within the established ceilings. Grant ceilings
are discussed in Section I.B.1. of this NOFA. Grant funds requested must be sufficient, either by themselves or in
conjunction with funds from other sources, to complete the project within a reasonable period of time. If other sources
of funds are to be used with respect to a project, the source of those funds must be identified and the level of commitment
indicated. 

c. 

Projects with multiple activities.

 If a project consists of more than one activity, the activity that directly addresses the need must represent at least
a majority of the funds requested. Other activities must be incidental to, and in support of the principal activity.


d. 

Applications with multiple projects.

 If an application contains more than one project, each project will be rated separately for program impact. Applicants
should note that regardless of the number of projects, the total grant amount cannot exceed the appropriate grant
ceilings identified in Section I.B.1. of this NOFA. 



3. Final Selection



The total points received by a project for all of the selection factors are added, and the project is ranked against
all other projects from all applications, regardless of the problem areas in which the projects were rated. The highest
ranked projects will be funded to the extent funds are available. Applicants will receive a single grant in the amount
of the project or projects applied for which were ranked high enough to be funded. In the case of ties at the funding line,
HUD will use the following criteria in order to break ties: 




_The project receiving the highest program impact rating will be funded; 

_If tied projects have the same program impact rating, the project having the highest combined score on the needs factors
will be funded; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-2-00203 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-2-00152 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_If tied projects have the same program impact ratings and equal needs factor scores, the project having the highest
score on the percent of persons in poverty needs factor will be funded; and 

_If tied projects have the same program impact ratings, equal needs factor scores, and an equal percent of persons
in poverty needs factor score, the application having the most outstanding performance in fair housing and equal
opportunity will be funded. 




As soon as possible after the rating and ranking process has been completed, HUD will notify all applicants regarding
their rating scores and funding status. Thereafter, applicants may contact HUD to discuss scores or any aspects of
the selection process. 



E. Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors



1. General 



Complete applications received from eligible applicants by the application due date are rated and scored by HUD.
Regardless of the type of grant sought (Single Purpose or Comprehensive), applications are rated and scored against
four factors. These four factors are discussed in more detail in subsection 3 of this Section E. Previous grantees
of Small Cities Program CDBG grants also undergo a performance evaluation. The criteria for determining adequacy
of performance are discussed in subsection 2 of this Section E. 



2. Performance Evaluation 



As noted in Section C of this NOFA, previous grantees of Small Cities Program CDBG grants are subject to an evaluation
of performance and capacity to undertake the proposed program. For purposes of making performance evaluations,
HUD will use any information available as of the application due date. Performance also will be evaluated using information
which may be available already to HUD, including previously submitted performance reports, site visit reports,
audits, monitoring reports and annual in-house reviews. Grantees may be requested to submit additional information,
if generally available facts raise a question as to capacity to undertake the proposed program. No grants will be made
to an applicant that does not have the capacity to undertake the proposed program. A performance determination will
be made by evaluation of the following areas: 

a. 

Community Development Activities.

 The following thresholds for performance in expending CDBG funds have been established for FY 1994 and pertain to
all Single Purpose and Comprehensive Grants: 




FY 1989 and earlier_Grants must be closed out 
FY 1990_Grant funds 100% expended 
FY 1991_Grant funds 75% expended 
FY 1992_Grant funds 30% expended 
FY 1993_Recipients must be on target with respect to the latest Small Cities Program Schedule received by HUD. 





Note:

 These standards will be used as benchmarks in judging program performance, but will not be the sole basis for determining
whether the applicant is ineligible for a grant due to a lack of capacity to carry out the proposed project or program.
Any applicant that fails to meet the percentages specified above may wish to provide updated data to HUD, either in
conjunction with the application submission or under separate cover, but in no case will data received by HUD after
the application due date be accepted. 




b. 

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

 An applicant will be considered to have performed inadequately if the applicant: 

(1) Has not substantially complied with the laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program,
including applicable civil rights laws as may be evidenced by: an outstanding finding of civil rights noncompliance,
unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed
to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against
it by a private individual, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order
designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; a deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;
a pending civil rights suit brought against it by the Department of Justice; or an unresolved charge of discrimination
issued against it by the Secretary under section 810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400; 

(2) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve findings made as a result of HUD monitoring; or 

(3) Has not resolved or attempted to resolve audit findings. 

An applicant will be ineligible for a grant where the inadequate performance in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations evidences a lack of capacity to carry out the proposed project or program. An application also will not
be accepted from a unit of general local government which has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation
for any HUD program. Additionally, applications will not be accepted from any entity which proposes an activity in
a unit of general local government that has an outstanding audit finding or monetary obligation for any HUD program.
The Director of the Community Planning and Development Division of the HUD field office may provide waivers to this
prohibition, but in no instance will a waiver be provided where funds are due HUD, unless a satisfactory arrangement
for repayment of the debt has been made. 

c. 

Performance assessment reports.

 Under 24 CFR 570.507, Small Cities CDBG grantees are required to submit Performance Assessment Reports (PARs) annually
on the date when the grant was originally executed. For an application for FY 1994 funds to be considered for funding,
the applicant must be current in its submission of Performance Assessment Reports. Failure to submit a PAR is not a
curable technical deficiency under Section V of this NOFA. 



3. Four Factor Rating 



As noted in subsections 1 and 3 of this Section E, all applications are rated and scored against four factors. These
four factors are: 




_Need based on absolute number of persons in poverty; 
_Need based on the percent of persons in poverty;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940527-2-00204 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940527-2-00152 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Program Impact; and 
_Outstanding performance in fair housing and equal opportunity.




A maximum of 615 points is possible under this system with the maximum points for each factor being: 








Each of the four factors is outlined below. All points for each factor are rounded to the nearest whole number. Applicants
should note that there is a distinct difference in the methods used to evaluate Program Impact for Single Purpose grants
versus Program Impact for Comprehensive grants. These differences are more fully discussed below. 

a. 

Need_Absolute number of persons in poverty. 

HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the absolute number of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit
of general local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately
for this factor. Applicants which are county governments are rated separately from all other applicants. Applicants
in each group are compared in terms of the number of persons whose incomes are below the poverty level. Individual scores
are obtained by dividing each applicant's absolute number of persons in poverty by the greatest number of persons
in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75. 

b. 

Need_Percent of persons in poverty. 

HUD uses 1990 census data to determine the percent of persons in poverty residing within the applicant unit of general
local government. Comprehensive and Single Purpose grant applicants are grouped and rated separately for this factor.
Applicants in each group are compared in terms of the percentage of their population below the poverty level. Individual
scores are obtained by dividing each applicant's percentage of persons in poverty by the highest percentage of persons
in poverty of any applicant and multiplying by 75. 

c. 

Program Impact_General. 

In evaluating program impact, HUD will consider:




_Extent and seriousness of the identified needs; 
_Results to be achieved; 
_Number of beneficiaries, given the type of program; 
_Nature of the benefit; 
_Additional actions that may be necessary to fully resolve the need; 
_Previous coordinated actions taken by the applicant to address the need; 
_Environmental considerations; 
_Whether displacement will be involved and what steps will be taken to minimize displacement and to mitigate its adverse
effects or related hardships; and 
_Where appropriate, housing site selection standards. 





Assessments are done on a comparative basis and, as a result, it is important that each applicant present information
in a detailed and uniform manner. 


In addressing Program Impact criteria, applicants should adhere to the following general guidelines for quantification.
Where appropriate, absolute and percentage figures should be used to describe the extent of community development
needs and the impact of the proposed program. This includes, but is not limited to, appropriate units of measure (e.g.,
number of housing units or structures, linear feet of pipe, pounds per square inch, etc.), and costs per unit of measure.
These quantification guidelines apply to the description of need, the nature of proposed activities and the extent
to which the proposed program will address the identified need.

Appropriate documentation should be provided to support the degree of need described in the application. Basically,
the sources for all statements and conclusions relating to community needs should be included in the application
or incorporated by reference. Examples of appropriate documentation include planning studies, letters from public
agencies, newspaper articles, photographs and survey data. 
Generally, the most effective documentation is that which specifically addresses the subject matter and has a high
degree of credibility. Applicants which intend to conduct surveys to obtain data are advised to contact the appropriate
HUD office prior to conducting the survey for a determination as to whether the survey methodology is statistically
acceptable. 
There are a number of program design factors related to feasibility which can alter significantly the award of impact
points. Accordingly, it is imperative that applicants provide adequate documentation in addressing these factors.
Common feasibility issues include site control, availability of other funding sources, validity of cost estimates,
and status of financial commitments as well as evidence of the status of regulatory agency review and approval. 
Past productivity and administrative performance of prior grantees will be taken into consideration when reviewing
the overall feasibility of the program. Overall program design, administration and guidelines are other feasibility
issues that should be articulated and presented in the application, since they are critical in assessing the effectiveness
and impact of the proposed program. 
(1) 

Program Impact_Single Purpose Grants. 

Each project will be rated against other projects addressing the same problem area, so that, for example, housing
projects only will be compared with other housing projects, according to the criteria outlined below. It should be
noted that each project within an application will be given a separate impact rating, if each one is clearly designated
by the applicant as a separate and distinct project (i.e. separate Needs Descriptions, Community Development Activities,
and Impact Description and Program Schedule forms have been filled out, indicating separate project names). 
In some cases, it may be to the applicant's advantage to designate separate projects for activities that can ``stand
on their own'' in terms of meeting the described need, especially where a particular project would tend to weaken the
impact rating of the other activities, if they were all related as a whole, as has been the case with some economic development
projects. If, however, the projects tend to meet the impact criteria to the same extent, or the weaker element is only
a small portion of the overall program, there is no discernable benefit in designating separate projects. 
Applicants should bear in mind that the impact of the proposed project will be judged by persons who may not be familiar
with the particular community. Accordingly, individual projects will be rated according to how well the application
demonstrates in specific, measurable terms, the extent to which the impact criteria are met. General statements
of need and impact alone will not be sufficient to obtain a favorable rating. 
(a) 

Program Impact_Single Purpose_Housing. 

There are three distinct types of Single Purpose Housing projects: Housing Rehabilitation, Creation of New Housing
and Direct Homeownership Assistance. Separate rating criteria are provided for each type of project. 

(i) 

Housing Rehabilitation_Needs. 

Each application should provide information on the total number of units in the project area, the number that are substandard,
and the number of substandard units occupied by low- and moderate-income households. The purpose of this information
is to establish the relative severity of housing conditions within the designated project area compared to other
housing rehabilitation applications. The application also should describe the date and methodology of any surveys
used to obtain the information, including an explicit and detailed definition of ``substandard''.

Surveys of housing conditions

. Surveys of housing conditions serve several purposes in evaluating applications for housing rehabilitation activities.
These include establishing the seriousness of need for such assistance in the project area, providing a basis for
estimating overall budgetary needs, and providing an indication of the marketability of the project. 


Project design and feasibility

. The application should describe the project in sufficient detail to allow the reviewer to assess its feasibility
and its probable impact on the conditions described. It also should describe project requirements in such a way that
regulatory and policy concerns will be addressed. 
In reviewing applications from grantees with prior housing rehabilitation projects, reasonableness of cost-per-unit,
stated in the application, will be compared against the grantee's actual past performance. All applications should
provide documentation to justify the cost-per-unit estimates, particularly grantees where past performance does
not support the estimates in the applications. 
It should be noted that HUD encourages communities to design projects supplementing CDBG rehabilitation funds with
private funds wherever feasible and appropriate, especially in the case of rental units and housing not occupied
by lower income persons. In such cases, the CDBG subsidy should be as low as possible, while retaining sufficient incentive
to attract local participants. On the other hand, projects designed for low income homeowners should not require
private contributions at a level that puts the project out of reach of potential participants. 
Where the creation of new units is proposed through conversion, the application should document the need for additional
units based on vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must
support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from the rehabilitation
of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structure for residential use, or new construction
projects for which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance. 
Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document
the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely
affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing
feasibility from the standpoint of market financing. 
The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility
and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. 
For projects consisting of more than one activity, the activity that directly addresses the need must represent at
least the majority of funds requested. Other activities must be incidental to and in support of the principal activity.
For example, public improvements included in a rehabilitation project that addresses housing need must: be a relatively
small amount in terms of funds requested; clearly be in support of the housing objective; and demonstrate a positive
and direct link to the national objective. 
For incidental activities claiming benefit to low- and moderate-income persons on an area basis, the application
must document that at least 51 percent of the residents of the service area meet the low- and moderate-income requirement.
Funds should not be requested for activities that are not incidental to, and in support of the principal activity.



Scoring

. Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner.
The objective for non-target area projects, in as much as they are 
sparsely populated, only should be to assist low- and moderate-income persons. Accordingly, the following standard
will be used for rating housing rehabilitation projects: 


Maximum (400 Points) 


1. Severe need is shown in the project area, in terms of the proportion of units that are substandard and the extent of
disrepair in the units. 
2. The project would bring all, or almost all, of the units in the project area up to standard. 
3. There are no feasibility questions, such as availability of other resources, marketability, or appropriateness
of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed. 
4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other housing projects. 
5. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Substantial (300 Points) 


1. Serious need is shown. 
2. Project would bring most of the units in the area up to standard. 
3. There are no major feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a substantial number of persons. 
5. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Moderate (200 Points) 


1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications. 
2. Project would bring units up to standard, but not to the same extent as other applications. 
3. There may be some minor feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a significant number of persons. 
5. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

Minimal (100 Points) 


1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented. 
2. Project may bring most units up to standard, but not to same extent as in other applications. 
3. There are serious feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a small number of persons. 
5. Minimally supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Insignificant (0 Points) 


1. Very little need has been demonstrated. 
2. Project would not rehabilitate most units. 
3. There are serious feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a very small number of persons. 
5. Does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 

(ii) 

Creation of new housing

. CDBG funds may be used to support the construction of new housing units, and, in certain circumstances, to finance
the actual cost of constructing new units. New construction may be carried out by an eligible non-profit entity pursuant
to 24 CFR 570.204, or as last resort housing. Support of new construction could include activities such as the acquisition
and/or clearance of land, the provision of infrastructure, or the payment of certain planning costs. 

Where the creation of new units is proposed, the application should document the need for additional units based on
vacancy rates, waiting lists, and other pertinent information. The proposed project clearly must support, or result
in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons. The units may result from new construction projects for
which the proposed project will provide non-construction assistance. 

Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant must identify and document
the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment for assistance may adversely
affect project impact. Applicants should address issues of site control and marketability, in addition to addressing
feasibility from the standpoint of market financing. 

The impact of the proposed project will be based on the degree of need, the number of units to be created, overall feasibility
and the nature and cost of the proposed activities. 



Scoring

. Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Accordingly, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all projects receiving a particular rating will match all the criteria point-by-point, in the same manner.
Accordingly, the following standard will be used for rating projects supporting new housing construction: 



Maximum (400 Points) 


1. Severe need for new housing affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown in the project area. 
2. Project would create a large number of new housing units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons.

of project design, which would hinder the timely completion of the project as proposed. 
4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other new housing projects. 
5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice by resulting in the spatial deconcentration of minorities
throughout the community, or would provide spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income households if there
are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Substantial (300 Points) 


1. Serious need for new units affordable to low- and moderate-income persons is shown. 
2. Project would create a substantial number of new housing units. 
3. There are no major feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a substantial number of persons. 
5. Project would affirmatively further fair housing choice through significant efforts toward the spatial deconcentration
of minorities throughout the community, or would provide significant efforts toward spatial deconcentration of
low- and moderate-income households if there are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Moderate (200 Points) 


1. Serious need is shown, but is not as well documented as in other applications. 
2. Project would create new units but not a substantial number. 
3. There may be some minor feasibility questions. 
4. Benefits a significant number of persons. 
5. Project would have some effect of affirmatively furthering fair housing choice by encouraging spatial deconcentration
of minorities throughout the community, or would encourage spatial deconcentration of low- and moderate-income
households if there are no areas of minority concentration. 
6. Moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 



Minimal (100 Points) 


1. Some need is evident, but it is not serious compared to other applications, or is not well documented.

6. Does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 

(iii) 

Direct homeownership assistance. 

Homeownership activities are defined as activities which would promote homeownership within the applicant jurisdiction,
focusing particularly on aiding low- and moderate-income persons in becoming homeowners. While declining to identify
any particular type of proposed project as superior, HUD is identifying several criteria which must be addressed
within the project design, in order for the application to receive the maximum project impact. 
Applications must include a well developed description of homeownership needs in the applicant jurisdiction, focusing
particularly on the needs of low- and moderate-income persons. The description also should include, if applicable,
any alternative approaches which have been considered in meeting homeownership needs. Project feasibility must
be addressed as part of the application. 
The application must demonstrate that the proposed project would make effective use of all available funds. This
would include any local, State or other Federal funds which would be utilized by the proposed project. If other such
funds are included as part of the proposed project, the applicant must demonstrate that such funds are committed and
truly available for the project. Any efforts which would affirmatively further fair housing, by promoting homeownership
among minorities as well as homeownership throughout the community, must be outlined in the application. 
The application must explain how the project would benefit low- and moderate-income homebuyers, particularly focusing
on first-time and minority homebuyers. The application also should address any homeownership counseling services,
including counseling pertaining to Federal, State, and local fair housing laws and requirements, which would be
provided to persons selected to participate in the proposed project. Finally, the application should describe how
the project would utilize public/private partnerships to promote homeownership, particularly in the sense that
private sector financing would be accessible, as necessary, to project participants to complement available public
sector funds, including CDBG money. 
HUD will review each application which meets the threshold against the following criteria: 


Maximum (400 Points) 


1. Project design is appropriate to meet demonstrated homeownership need and alternative approaches to meeting
the need are shown to have been considered. Additionally, there are no feasibility questions regarding the implementation
and execution of the proposed project according to the schedule. 2. The application documents serious homeownership
needs in the community and the proposed project would make effective use of available funds. 
3. The proposed project would affirmatively further fair housing by including initiatives to reach out to potential
minority homeowners and by promoting homeownership opportunities throughout the community. 
4. The proposed project would target first-time homebuyers. 
5. The proposed project would provide homeownership counseling to project participants. 
6. The proposed project would complement other Federal, State or local programs which promote homeownership. 
7. The proposed project would utilize public/private partnerships in attempting to promote homeownership, particularly
in regard to participation by local financial institutions. 
8. Significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Substantial (300 Points) 


1. Project design demonstrates a workable approach to homeownership assistance needs, and there are no major feasibility
questions regarding implementation of the proposed project. 
2. Substantial homeownership needs are documented by the application, and the proposed project would make effective
use of available funds. 
3. The proposed project would affirmatively further fair housing by promoting homeownership opportunities throughout
the community. 
4. The proposed project would encourage homeownership among first-time homebuyers. 
5. The proposed project would encourage local financial institutions to lend to assisted homebuyers. 
6. Substantially supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

(b) 

Program impact_single purpose_public facilities affecting public health and safety. 

In the case of public facility projects, documentation of the problem by outside, third-party sources is of primary
importance. In the case of water and sewer projects, documentation from public agencies is particularly helpful,
especially where such agencies have pinpointed the exact cause of the problem and have recommended courses of action
which would eliminate the problem. Such supporting documentation should be as up-to-date as possible: the older
the supporting material, the more doubt arises that the need is current and immediate. Applicants also should be sure
to indicate how the project would address public health and safety needs and conditions. Quantification also is essential
in describing needs. Documentation from those affected should be included. 
In order to show that the project is likely to impact upon the problem, the following items should be covered: 
(1) Total project costs. Total project costs should be documented by qualified third party estimates, and be as recent
as possible. 
(2) Source of other funds. To the extent that CDBG funds will not cover all costs, the source of other funds should be
identified and committed. If local funds are to be used, the applicant should show both the willingness and the ability
to provide the funds. (3) How the project will solve the problem. The applicant should demonstrate that the project
will completely solve the problem and, if applicable, the applicant should address whether the proposal would be
satisfactory to other State/local agencies which have jurisdiction over the problem. 
(4) Cost effectiveness of the proposal. The applicant should address whether the proposal is the most cost effective
and efficient among the possible alternatives considered. 
(5) Reasonableness of service area. The applicant should address whether the service area claimed for the project
is reasonable, in view of the nature of the proposed project, and if not, the applicant should address what effect a
more realistic appraisal would have on overall benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. 
(6) Project impact on public health and safety; and 
(7) Other applicable feasibility issues have been addressed. 
Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. Therefore, it is difficult
to define precisely those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all applications receiving a particular rating will match point-for-point all the criteria in the same
way. 
The following standards will be applied: 


Maximum (400 Points) 


1. Need is serious, current and requires prompt attention. 
2. Program would resolve the problem completely, either through funds requested or with the support of other resources
already committed. 
3. No other obstacles to timely and effective implementation of the program exist. 
4. Benefits a large number of persons when compared to other public facility projects.

Program impact_single purpose_economic development projects.

 
As discussed earlier in this section of the NOFA, each individual Single Purpose project will receive a separate impact
rating. Applicants whose proposed economic development program will include multiple proposals should determine
the most appropriate form of submission. This determination will require a choice as to either the incorporation
of all proposals into a single project or the submission of separate projects for each proposal (each transaction
will be considered a separate project). The single project format presents an ``all or nothing'' situation. In determining
the appropriate submission format, applicants should consider the ability of a transaction to rate well on its own,
based on the magnitude of employment impact, size of the financial transaction and the other factors discussed in
this section. 

The submission of proposals as separate projects must be clearly designated by the applicant with individual Needs
Descriptions, Community Development Activities, Impact Descriptions and Program Schedule forms, including an
appropriate name for each project on HUD Form 4124.1. 

Section 807(c)(3) of the 1992 Act provides that it is the sense of Congress that each grantee should devote one percent
of its grant for the purpose of providing assistance under section 105(a)(23) of the HCD Act to facilitate economic
development through commercial microenterprises. A microenterprise is defined as a commercial enterprise with
five or fewer employees, one or more of whom owns the enterprise. This should be considered in developing an economic
development application. 

It is noted that in accordance with section 806 of the 1992 Act, the Department will soon publish a proposed rule relating
to evaluation and selection of Economic Development activities by grantees. It is strongly suggested that you read
the proposed rule as it reflects the Department's latest proposed policy on the evaluation of Economic Development
Projects.

In addition to the standard submission requirements, to receive maximum points, Small Cities applicants must submit
information that demonstrates that CDBG funds are needed for the proposed project or activity. HUD will evaluate
this material as part of its Eligibility Review prior to considering an application for funding in the FY 1994 competition.
The following is a discussion of some of the factors HUD will consider in assessing projects in these key areas: 

(i) 

The appropriate determination.

 HUD requires that economic development activities undertaken with CDBG funds be appropriate to carry out an economic
development project. Applicants should attempt to demonstrate that each economic development project has a reasonable
likelihood of success. 

Applicants must document the financial analysis of the project's need for assistance, as well as public benefit factors
that were considered in making its determination that assistance is appropriate. The applicant is expected to provide
clear documentation on how the decision was reached. 

The written documentation of the financial analysis of the project's need should use the following steps: 

1. 

Reasonableness of Proposed Costs.

_The applicant must review each project cost element and determine that the cost is reasonable and consistent with
third-party, fair-market prices for that cost element. The general principle is that the level of CDBG assistance
cannot be adequately determined if the project costs are understated or inflated. 

2. 

Commitment of Other Sources of Funds.

 The applicant shall review all projected sources of funds necessary to complete the project and shall verify that
all sources (in particular private debt and equity financing) have been firmly committed to the extent practicable,
and are available to be invested in the project. Verification means ascertaining that: the source of funds is committed;
that the terms and conditions of the committed funds are known; and the source has the capacity to deliver. 

3. 

No Substitution of CDBG Funds for Private Sources of Funds.

 The applicant shall financially underwrite the project and ensure to the extent possible that CDBG funds are not being
substituted for available private debt financing or equity capital. The analysis must be tailored to the type of project
being assisted (i.e. real estate, user project, capital equipment, working capital, etc.). Real estate projects
require different financial analysis than working capital or machinery and equipment projects. Applicants should
ensure that both a significant equity commitment by the for-profit business exists, and that the level of certainty
of the end use of the property or project is sufficient to ensure the achievement of national objectives within a reasonable
period of time. 

4. 

Establishment of CDBG Financing Terms. 

The amount of CDBG assistance provided to a for-profit business ideally should be limited to the amount, with appropriate
repayment terms, sufficient to go forward without substituting CDBG funds for available private debt or cash equity.
The applicant should structure its repayment terms so that the business is allowed a reasonable rate of return on invested
equity, considering the level of risk of the project. It should be remembered that equity funds generally should bear
the greatest risk of all funds invested in a project. 

5. 

Assessing Public Benefit.

 The extent of public benefit expected to be derived from the economic development project must be assessed. While
no standards have been promulgated in a final rule, the assessment of public benefit should consider such factors
as the number and type of jobs to be created or retained, in relation to the needs of low- and moderate-income persons
who are likely to be employed, the extent to which a business provides essential services to low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods, and increases to the tax base including property, sales and income taxes in the area. These factors
are not all inclusive. 

(ii) 

CDBG assistance must minimize business and job displacement.

 Each applicant will evaluate the potential of each economic development project for causing displacement of existing
businesses and lost jobs in the neighborhood where the project is proposed to be located. When the grantee concludes
that the potential exists to cause displacement, given the size, scope or nature of the business, then the grantee
must, to the extent practicable, take steps to minimize such displacement. The project file must document the grantee's
review conclusions and, if applicable, the steps the grantee will take to minimize displacement. 

(iii) 

Section 105(a)(17) requirements.

 Section 105 (a)(17) of the HCD Act requires that an activity assisted under that section achieve one of the following
criteria: 

(1) Creates or retains jobs for low- and moderate-income persons (note that a project which meets the national objective
of principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons by creating or retaining jobs, 51 percent of which are
for low- and moderate-income persons, will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional documentation);


(2) Prevents or eliminates slums or blight (note that a project which meets the national objective of aiding in the
prevention or elimination of slums or blight on an area basis will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional
documentation); 

(3) Meets an urgent need (note that a project which meets the national objective of meeting community development
needs having a particular urgency will be deemed to have met this criterion without any additional documentation);


(4) Creates or retains businesses owned by community residents; 

(5) Assists businesses that provide goods or services needed by and affordable to low- and moderate-income residents;


(6) Provides technical assistance to promote any of the activities under (1) through (5) of this subsection.

(iv) 

National objectives.

 As previously stated in this NOFA, all CDBG-assisted activities must address one of the three broad national objectives.
Since economic development projects usually result in new employment or the retention of existing jobs, these activities
most likely would be categorized as principally benefitting low- and moderate-income persons in this manner. Such
projects will be considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons where the criteria of 24 CFR 570.208(a)(4)
are met. HUD will consider an activity to qualify under this provision where the activity involves jobs at least 51
percent of which are taken by or made available to such persons, or retained by such persons. The extent to which the
proposed project will directly address employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income persons in the applicant
jurisdiction will be a primary factor in HUD's assessment of the proposed program. 

In determining whether the person is a low- and moderate-income person for these activities, it is the person's family
income at the time the CDBG assistance is provided that is determinative. When making judgments concerning whether
an individual qualifies as a low- and moderate-income person, both family size and the income of the entire family
must be considered. This consideration is necessary because a low- and moderate-income person is defined as a member
of a low- and moderate-income family. The 1992 Act amends the HCD Act by stating that a person may be presumed to be a low-
and moderate-income person if the employee resides in a census tract where not less than 70 percent of the residents
are low- and moderate-income persons. HUD will also accept a written certification by a person of his or her family
income and size to establish low- and moderate-income status. The certification may simply state that the person's
family income is below that required to be low- and moderate-income in that area. The form for such certification must
include a statement that the information is subject to verification. The application must contain adequate documentation
to explain fully, and to support, the process that will be used to ensure that project(s) comply with the low- and moderate-income
employment requirements. The documentation must be sufficient to show that the process has been developed and that
program participants have agreed to adhere to that process. 


(v) 

Application requirements.

 To the extent feasible, the material listed below should be submitted for economic development projects. The material
should be submitted for each proposed activity (e.g., each loan will be considered a separate activity), whether
the proposed activity is presented as a separate project or as part of a project involving multiple activities. Since
economic development projects are rated against each other, the more completely these submission requirements
are met, the greater the potential exists for enhancing the impact score of the project. 


1. A letter from each appropriate developmental entity which includes at least the following information: 


a. A detailed physical description of the project with a schedule of events and maps or drawings as appropriate. 


b. The estimated costs for the project, including any working capital requirements. 


c. A discussion of all financing sources, including the need for CDBG, the terms of the CDBG assistance, and the proposed
lien structure. The amount, source and nature of any equity investment(s) must also be provided as well as a commitment
to invest the equity. 


d. A discussion of employment impact which includes a schedule of newly created positions. The schedule should identify
the number, salary and skill level of each permanent position to be created. If jobs are made available to low- and moderate-income
persons, the applicant must also demonstrate and document how persons from low- and moderate-income households
will be accorded first consideration for employment opportunities. 

e. A discussion of all appropriate feasibility issues including, but not limited to: site control, zoning, public
approvals and permits, impact fees, corporate authorizations, infrastructure, environment and relocation. 


f. An analysis and summary of market and other data which supports the anticipated success of the project. 


2. A development budget showing all costs for the project, 
including professional fees and working capital. 

3. Documentation to support project costs. Documentation generally should be from a third party source and be consistent
with the following guidelines: 

a. Acquisition costs should be supported by an appraisal. 

b. Construction/renovation costs should be certified by an architect, engineer or contractor. Use of Federal Prevailing
Wage Rates should be cited where applicable. 

c. Machinery and equipment costs should be supported by vendor quotes. 

d. Soft costs (e.g., legal, accounting, title insurance) need be substantiated only where such costs are anticipated
to be abnormally high. 

4. Letters from all financing sources discussing (at a minimum) the amount and terms of the proposed financing, and
the current status of the application for funding. 

5. Historical financial data of the development entity, preferably for the last three years. This information may
be submitted under separate cover with confidentiality requested. It is recognized that historical financial data
may be unavailable or inappropriate for some projects (e.g., start-up companies and real estate transactions).


6. A two-to-five year cash flow pro forma with accompanying notes citing basic assumptions.

7. The applicant's assessment of the project's consistency with the CDBG program eligibility appropriate standards
and with the national objectives requirements. 

(vi) 

Review criteria.

 In evaluating and rating economic development projects, HUD will analyze the following factors: 

1. 

Employment:

 The extent to which the proposed project will directly address employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income
persons in the applicant's jurisdiction will be a primary factor in HUD's assessment of program impact. Applicants
are reminded that for an activity to be consistent with the statutory objective of low- and moderate-income benefit,
as a result of the creation or retention of jobs, at least 51 percent of created or retained employment opportunities
must be held by, or made available to, persons from low- and moderate-income families. Applicants must fully document
and describe employment benefits. In addition, applicants should address the following issues: 

a. All employment data must be expressed in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs). Only permanent jobs may be counted,
and applicants must take into account such factors as seasonal and part-time employment. A seasonal job may be considered
permanent if the season is long enough to be considered the person's principal occupation; permanent part-time jobs
must be converted to the full-time equivalent. 

b. The amount of CDBG assistance required to produce each full-time equivalent job will affect the impact assessment
by HUD. Lower CDBG costs per job are preferable to higher CDBG costs per job. Such assessments of impact will be done
on a comparative basis among all projects submitted, rather than by comparison to a given standard. 

c. The use of CDBG funds to assist a business with transferring to a different community will generally be considered
as having 

no

 employment impact. Exceptions to this rule may include an expansion to the business as a result of, or concurrent with,
the transfer; or if the business can demonstrate that it is infeasible to continue operations at the current site.
If the applicant proposes to assist in a transfer of operations based on an exception to the general rule, HUD should
be contacted early in the planning process to discuss the viability of such a proposal. Failure to do so could result
in the application receiving 0 impact points. 

d. Applicants are encouraged to use CDBG funds for projects that provide as many jobs as possible for individuals that
are currently receiving public assistance. Providing employment to recipients of public assistance will help break
the cycle of dependency and empower low income citizens to take control of their lives. 

2. 

Feasibility.

 A high-impact rating will not be given to projects that are likely to encounter feasibility issues which would hinder
the timely completion of the project. Such issues include, but are not limited to: site control, zoning, public approvals
and permits, infrastructure, environment, and relocation. Applicants should address these and any other applicable
issues and provide documentation where appropriate. 

Applicants also must demonstrate the reasonable likelihood of the project's success, from both a financial and employment
standpoint. An analysis or market data, which indicates an inordinate risk in the undertaking of the project, will
affect the overall rating of program impact. 

3. 

Leverage. 

Leverage is defined as the amount of private debt and equity to be invested as a direct result of the CDBG-funded activity.
Projects which fully conform with those requirements by providing the maximum feasible level of private investment
will be considered as having appropriate leverage. The extent of firm commitments for private financing will be reviewed
as well as the amount of equity investment. The project will be reviewed to determine whether CDBG funds are replacing
private sources of funds. In order to receive maximum impact CDBG funds may not replace private financing, CDBG assistance
must be limited to the amount necessary to fund the project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity
funds should bear the greatest risk in the project. 

4. 

Taxes. 

While not a primary factor in the evaluation of impact, projects which will augment the applicant's tax base may have
a positive effect on the rating of program impact. It is recognized, however, that good projects do not always result
in increased tax revenues due to their nature. 

5. 

Repayment.

 Where CDBG repayments are to be made in some manner to the applicant, the proposed use of those repayments for economic
development purposes will be considered. 

6. 

Cost Reasonableness.

 In order to receive a rating greater than the minimal, the costs must be reasonable, i.e. not inflated. 

7. 

Base Closures.

 The Department recognizes that communities facing the loss of a military base may need a well-planned economic development
project to help alleviate the effect of the base closure. Well planned projects that will help successfully alleviate
the economic impact of base closures will tend to have a high impact and rate well in the competition. 

8. 

Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities. 

The Department is supportive of using funds from this NOFA to support projects in designated Empowerment Zones and
Enterprise Communities. A project that significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone
or Enterprise Community will receive a maximum impact score provided that the other factors for maximum impact are
met.

(vii) 

Scoring.

 Individual projects often vary in the extent to which they meet the criteria outlined above. It is, therefore, difficult
to precisely define those combinations of characteristics which constitute, for example, ``maximum'' versus ``substantial''
impact. Not all applications receiving a ``maximum'' rating will match all the criteria, point by point, in the same
manner. The following standards will be applied: 



Maximum (400 Points) 



1. The analysis of market and other risk data provides reasonable assurance that the project will be successful. 
2. The project will have a direct and positive impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households, and the extent of that impact compares favorably with that of other applicants. 
3. All appropriate feasibility issues have been addressed (including the submission of firm private financing commitments)
and there is reasonable assurance that the project will be completed in a timely manner. 
4. The Public Benefits (e.g., loan repayments, increases to the tax base including property, sales and income taxes
to the area, other development likely to be stimulated by the activity) to be derived from the project are considerable
relative to other proposals. 
5. The infusion of CDBG funds will leverage a substantial investment of private and other dollars. 
6. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 
7. CDBG funds will not replace private financing, CDBG assistance will be limited to the amount necessary to fund the
project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity funds will bear the greatest risk in the project.

8. Project significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.



Substantial (300 Points) 


The criteria for Maximum (400 Points) is met, with either of the following exceptions: 
1. While the project will have a direct and positive impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households, the extent of that impact is less than that demonstrated by applicants receiving the maximum rating.

2. While there are no major feasibility problems, there are feasibility issues which have not been fully addressed
and/or may have a negative effect on timely implementation of the project. However, overall success of the project
appears achievable. 
In addition: 
3. The Public Benefits derived from this project will be greater than that received by the majority of applicants.

4. CDBG funds will leverage more private and/or other public dollars than the majority of projects in the competition.

5. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 
6. CDBG funds will not replace private financing, CDBG assistance will be limited to the amount necessary to fund the
project without replacing CDBG funds for private funds, and equity funds will bear as great a risk as other project
funds. 
7. Project significantly supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.



Moderate (200 Points) 


The project presents at least one of the following deficiencies which would affect the appropriateness of CDBG funding:

1. An analysis of the project indicates that the likelihood of the availability of other required financing is questionable.

2. There is a major feasibility issue which is likely to affect completion of the project. 
3. The analysis of market and other risk data indicates a likelihood that the project will not create a significant
employment impact. 
4. The number of employment positions to be created is significantly low and/or the CDBG cost per employment position
is significantly high in relation to other applications. 
In addition: 
5. There will be some Public Benefits resulting from this project. 
6. CDBG dollars will leverage a moderate amount of private and/or other public funds relative to other projects. 
7. The project costs are reasonable (i.e. not inflated). 
8. Project moderately supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Minimal (100 Points) 


The project presents at least one of the following serious deficiencies which would affect the appropriateness of
CDBG funding: 
1. An analysis of the project indicates that other required financing is unlikely to be available. 
2. There will be few, if any, Public Benefits resulting from this project. 
3. CDBG dollars will leverage little private and/or other public investment in the project. 
4. Project minimally supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 


Insignificant (0 Points) 


The activity presents at least one of the following serious deficiencies which indicates the inappropriateness
of CDBG funding: 
1. It is clear that the activity cannot be accomplished based on any combination of the following factors: 
(1) Major feasibility issues. 
(2) Inordinate risk. 
(3) Unavailability of required financing.

2. The activity will not have a direct impact on employment opportunities for persons from low- and moderate-income
households. 
3. The completion of the project will result in no Public Benefits or will be detrimental to the community. 
4. No other investment will be triggered by the use of CDBG funds for this activity. 
5. Project does not support the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. 
(2) 

Program impact_comprehensive program grants.

 Comprehensive programs must address a substantial portion of the identifiable community development needs of a
defined area(s). The extent to which activities are coordinated will be a major consideration in the evaluation of
program impact. In defining an appropriate area for comprehensive treatment, applicants should consider the severity
of condition within the area and the resources to be provided. The impact is greatest where community development
needs will be substantially addressed over a reasonable period of time. Exceptions to the requirement that activities
be concentrated within a defined area or areas may be made if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed program
represents a reasonable means of addressing the identified needs. 
HUD will assess the impact of the program for each of the four program design criteria selected, based on the factors
described below. Applicants must describe fully the extent to which the program will address each criterion selected.
HUD will compare all programs which address a particular 
criterion. The best proposal for that criterion will be the standard by which all others will be judged, although that
proposal will not necessarily be awarded a significant impact. 
Assignment of Program Impact points for a Comprehensive Grant application is a two-step process. First, the potential
of the proposed program of activities to achieve the results intended by each selected criterion when considered
in relation to other communities selecting the same criterion is assessed. A numerical value is assigned, based on
the following:



The results would have insignificant impact_0 Points 
The results would have minimal impact_2 Points 
The results would have a moderate impact_4 Points 
The results would have a maximum impact_8 points 



After each of the four criteria selected by an applicant is rated and a value assigned, the values are summed. A minimum
of 12 points will be required at this stage in order for the application to be eligible for further consideration. A
score of less than 12 points indicates that the proposed activities would have insufficient impact to warrant funding.

Following this process, the actual points for impact are determined by dividing each applicant's Program Impact
Score by the highest Program Impact Score achieved by any applicant and multiplying the result by 400. 
Listed below are the ten design criteria and the standards which HUD has developed to evaluate each criterion. The
applicant must select and address four of the criteria. In addition to these standards, the Submission Requirements
and Review Criteria for Economic Development Projects under the Single Purpose Program apply in determining the
eligibility and rating for economic development proposals that are a part of a Comprehensive Program. It is particularly
important that applicants fully address the economic development criteria should Criteria 5 and 6 be selected. 
(a) 

Criterion 1_Supports Comprehensive Neighborhood Conservation, Stabilization, Revitalization, New Housing
Construction or Promotes Homeownership.

 The applicant must describe the degree to which the identified needs of a defined area or areas will be addressed in
a coordinated manner. In defining an area or areas, applicants should examine carefully the extent of needs and the
resources available to address those needs. Where an area has not been defined, the applicant should describe fully
the appropriateness of implementing activities on a community-wide basis. 
In evaluating the impact of the proposed program, HUD will examine the following factors: 



_Nature and severity of neighborhood needs. 
_Extent to which needs will be addressed. 
_Amount of funds required to implement neighborhood activities. 
_Extent to which activities are coordinated to address housing, public facility and economic development needs.
Program impact will be the greatest where a substantial portion of the needs within a defined area will be met. 
_Extent to which the project promotes fair housing choice in homeownership among protected classes. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.




The strongest consideration for housing rehabilitation programs is given to those applicants which have designed
their housing programs by taking into account both structural conditions and appropriate financing mechanisms.
The proposed program should be structured in a way to be marketable, given income and structural characteristics
of the neighborhood area. The physical needs of residential or mixed use properties must be well stated and documented
in terms of substandardness. Applicants will be expected to maximize the leveraging of private funds, encourage
the participation of local financial institutions, and develop realistic program guidelines. Private funds available
from financial lending sources should be established. If leveraging is infeasible, the applicant must fully document
that fact. The most effective housing programs will be those which will address a substantial portion of the identified
needs, while maximizing the impact of Federal funds.

For those programs that will support the construction of new residential units, project feasibility will be critical.
While the extent of need and number of units to be created will be a primary consideration in evaluating the impact,
issues of site control, marketability and assurance of private financing must be addressed, and must be documented.


Homeownership activities will be reviewed in terms of: how effectively the program would meet homeownership needs
identified in the community; and the extent to which they would make effective use of available funds. 
Public service activities also may be considered in conjunction with other activities under this criterion. Again,
any such activities would need to meet demonstrated needs within the community. 
The impact of public improvement activities will be assessed primarily on the documented severity of the need and
the extent to which the proposed program will address that need. Those needs which directly affect the public safety
and welfare will be considered the most severe. 
Economic development activities also will be evaluated by the extent to which they will alleviate the identified
problems. However, the assessed impact for these activities is often diminished due to feasibility concerns. In
addition to quantifying the extent of the anticipated improvements, applicants must demonstrate that the proposed
activities can be carried out_that is, documentation with respect to private participation in such activities must
be thorough. Letters of only general interest, by either property owners or other private sector participants, do
not necessarily ensure their participation in the program. Some degree of assurance of participation should be presented.

Review Criteria and Submission requirements for Housing described under the Single Purpose Program apply in evaluating
and rating housing proposals that are a part of a Comprehensive Program. 
(b) 

Criterion 2_Provides Housing Choice within the Community either Outside Areas with Concentrations of Minorities
and Low- and Moderate-Income Persons or in a Neighborhood which is Experiencing Revitalization and Substantial
Displacement as a Result of Private Reinvestment, by Enabling Low- and Moderate-Income Persons to Remain in their
Neighborhood.

 If a proposed program provides housing choice within the community outside areas with concentrations of minorities
and low- and moderate-income persons, the application must document that there are existing areas which do, in fact,
contain concentrations of low- and moderate-income families and minorities. The proposed program, if implemented,
must result in additional housing assistance being provided in areas of non-concentration. Communities with no
minorities or minority concentrations may receive impact points where opportunities are provided outside areas
of low- and moderate-income concentration. The degree of impact will be based upon the severity of needs, the number
of units to be provided, and the nature and cost of the activities. 
In a neighborhood which is experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment,
the applicant must provide a detailed description of the revitalization efforts within the neighborhood, the amount
of displacement of low- and moderate-income persons, and the manner in which the implementation of the proposed program
will enable displacees to remain in the neighborhood. The degree of needs, nature and cost of activities, and percentage
of needs to be addressed will be evaluated to determine program impact. 
(c) 

Criterion 3_Supports the Expansion of Housing for Low- and Moderate-Income Persons by Providing Additional Housing
Units Not Previously Available. 

The proposed program clearly must support, or result in, additional units for low- and moderate-income persons.
The units may result from the rehabilitation of currently vacant structures, conversion of non-residential structures
to residential use, or new construction projects for which the proposed program will provide non-construction or
construction assistance. Where the proposed project involves the use of Federally assisted housing, the applicant
must identify and document the current commitment status of the Federal assistance. Lack of a firm financial commitment
for assistance may adversely affect program impact. Applicants should address the areas of site control and marketability,
in addition to addressing feasibility from the standpoint of project financing. Consideration will not be given
to proposed programs which will rehabilitate occupied units or displace current occupants. The impact of the proposed
programs will be based upon the degree of needs, the number of units to be created, and the nature and cost of the proposed
activities. 
(d) 

Criterion 4_Addresses a Serious Deficiency in a Community's Public Facilities.

 Consideration will be given to the extent of deficiencies, and their relative seriousness, of the identified need.
The following factors will be considered:

 

_Documentation of the seriousness of deficiencies. Appropriate documentation should be provided to substantiate
the degree of seriousness. Those deficiencies which directly affect the public safety and welfare will be considered
most severe. 
_The nature and cost of the proposed activities in relation to the percentage of need to be addressed. 
_The extent to which the proposed program will address a variety of deficiencies in public facilities within a defined
area. 
_Coordination with other activities within the defined area. 
_The degree to which the application addresses such feasibility issues, including but not limited to, the validity
of cost estimates by qualified sources, the availability of other funds, site control, and environmental constraints.

_The number of persons to benefit.

<TEXT>
 

_The extent to which the project addresses serious deficiencies in accessibility requirements and/or expands the
number of accessible public facilities. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.




(e) 

Criterion 5_Expands or Retains Employment Opportunities.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs that will result in the creation of new jobs or retention of existing
employment opportunities. The following factors will be considered: 



_The number of jobs to be created or retained in relation to the identified needs. Documentation should be provided
to substantiate the number and type (permanent or seasonal, full or part-time) of job claimed. Letters from local
development agencies or expected participants which express more than general interest would be appropriate. With
respect to job retention, evidence should be provided to demonstrate that without the proposed program, existing
jobs would be lost. The applicant also must address the potential impact of job loss on the community. 



_The extent to which CDBG funds are used to leverage private commitments. If leveraging is proposed, applicants should
analyze the actual amount of additional funds required to make the project financially feasible. In designing a program
to assist existing business expansion or retention, or to encourage new business development, applicants must address
whether CDBG funds will be used for infrastructure, land assemblage or other financial incentives. These factors
may be important considerations for a firm deciding where to locate and whether to expand or reduce the scope of its
operation. CDBG funds may be more effectively used as a loan rather than a grant. In this regard, the CDBG funds would
generate additional program resources through loan repayments to the community. It is considered especially advantageous
if a revolving loan fund is established and repayments continue to be used to expand or retain employment opportunities.

 

_The relationship of the activity to other projects being implemented within the defined area. 
_The number of persons to benefit. 
_Particular attention will be given to the extent to which the Review Criteria and Submission Requirements for Economic
Development Projects are addressed (see Single Purpose Program Criteria). 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

_Extent to which the project results in the employment of persons on public assistance. 



(f) 

Criterion 6_Attracts or Retains Businesses which Provide Essential Services.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs which will address the attraction or retention of businesses commonly
associated with neighborhood needs (corner grocery stores, dry cleaners, pharmacies, etc.). The applicant must
describe clearly the nature and anticipated impact of activities. Documentation in the form of letters from existing
or new potential businesses offering a commitment to the program should be included. (Letters of only general interest
by property owners do not necessarily ensure their participation in the program, or their willingness to secure debt
if private lending is proposed). The following factors will be considered:



_The impact of the proposed program in relation to the identifiable neighborhood needs. The extent of area stability
must be documented. In describing the needs of a business district or neighborhood commercial area, such factors
as overall structural conditions, business turnovers, and vacancy rates over a period of time should be clearly presented.
The formulation of a commercial revitalization program must be based on a thorough assessment of local needs and a
realistic program design. An important consideration is whether the proposed program is designed to be marketable
given income characteristics, local business condition, etc. The condition of supporting public facilities and
improvements and their influence on the business environment must be established. If public improvements are proposed
in connection with economic expansion or retention, applicants must address the extent to which the lack of these
improvements impact on business. 
_Attraction/retention must be fully documented by the applicant. With respect to business retention, evidence
should be provided to demonstrate clearly and objectively that without the proposed CDBG Program, existing retail/commercial
businesses would curtail their operations. The applicant also must document and address the potential impact of
the business loss on the community and/or target area. HUD would accept as examples of clear and objective evidence
a notice issued by the business to affected employees, a public announcement by the business, or financial records
provided by the business that clearly indicate the need for closing or moving all or portions of the business out of
the area.

<PARENT> FR940527-2-00152 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_The amount of private funds to be leveraged. If leveraging is proposed, applicants should analyze the actual amount
of private or public funds needed to make the project financially feasible. In this regard, the establishment of a
revolving loan fund, in which repayments would continue to be used to attract or retain businesses providing essential
services, would be considered a positive factor.

 

_The relationship of the activity to a comprehensive approach to meeting the overall needs of the neighborhood area.

_The impact of the proposed program in utilizing minority, women-owned, and project area businesses. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

_Extent to which the project results in the employment of persons on public assistance. 



(g) 

Criterion 7_Removes Slums or Blighting Conditions.

 Consideration will be given to proposed programs which will have a direct impact on the removal of slums or blighting
conditions. Appropriate areas may include, but are not limited to, deteriorated residential or commercial structures,
inappropriate land uses, or blighting conditions, such as repeated flooding and drainage problems or serious deficiencies
in public facilities. Applicants should be aware that slum and blight activities can be carried out under the national
objective of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. If an applicant elects to qualify the activity on this basis,
the degree of low- and moderate-income benefit must be demonstrated by the applicant. 
Where residential or commercial rehabilitation activities are proposed as preventing or eliminating blighting
conditions, the application must clearly document the number, type, and condition of deteriorating or deteriorated
buildings in the designated target area. Detailed conditions of the physical condition of buildings or structures
would be appropriate to establish the extent of substandard and blighting conditions. For rehabilitation of residential
structures to be designed as eliminating blight and addressing an area's deterioration, the buildings must be considered
substandard under local definition. 
When an area is determined to be blighted, there must be a substantial number of deteriorated or dilapidated buildings,
or the public improvements throughout the area must be in a state of deterioration. The proposed CDBG program or project
must be designed to eliminate or address a substantial portion of the identified blighting conditions or physical
decay. CDBG assistance for facilities or structures which are in good repair and show no real signs of deterioration
would not score well under this criterion. For instance, minor facade improvements to a commercial building alone
would not indicate that a building is in poor condition. However, assistance to a commercial area which consists of
deteriorating businesses, storefronts in serious need of rehabilitation, a high vacancy factor, and public improvements,
such as parking areas and parking access improvements which are in need of physical upgrading, would have a direct
impact on eliminating blighting conditions. Public improvements that are so deteriorated that they constitute
a genuine threat to the continued viability of an area by discouraging private investment necessary to maintain properties
may also be 
considered a blighting influence. The following factors will be considered:

 

_Extent and documented seriousness of conditions/needs. References to engineering studies, surveys or letters
from appropriate local agencies should be included. 
_Impact of the proposed program in relation to providing long-term permanent solutions to alleviate the identified
need. Short-term or superficial improvements will not be considered to have a significant impact. 
_Coordination with other projects and activities which will address needs within the defined area.
_Nature of any proposed re-use: degree of commitment for re-use. 
_Extent to which the project supports the strategic plan of a designated Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

Criterion 8_Resolves a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.

 
The applicant must describe the condition which poses a threat to public health and safety. A serious threat refers
to a situation which demands immediate attention. This may be a condition that has just occurred or a condition which,
though long standing, has intensified to become an immediate danger. 
Applicants should be aware that imminent threat/urgent need activities can be carried out under the national objective
of benefit to low- and moderate-income persons. If an applicant elects to qualify the activity on this basis, the degree
of low- and moderate-income benefit must be demonstrated by the applicant. Consideration will be given to the following:

 

_The extent to which a serious threat to health or safety is documented, or of recent origin, or which recently became
urgent. Documentation should include the identification of the existing conditions by appropriate agencies. 
_The extent to which the serious threat will be resolved. 
_The submission of documentation which demonstrates that other financial resources are insufficient or unavailable
to resolve such needs. 
_The degree to which the application addresses issues such as the validity of cost estimates by qualified sources;
the availability of other funds; site control and environmental conditions; or other public body approvals. 
_The number of persons to benefit, as well as the number of individuals actually threatened.

Note:

 This criterion is generally more restrictive than Criterion 4. The existing condition must pose a serious and immediate
threat to the health or welfare of the target population.




(i) 

Criterion 9_Supports Other Federal or State Programs Being Undertaken in the Community or Deals with the Adverse
Impact of Another Recent Federal or State Action. The Other Federal or State Program or Action Must Be of Substantial
Size or Impact in the Community in Relation to the Proposed Program.

 The application must contain a complete description of the Federal or State Program(s) (excluding other CDBG Programs)
which currently are underway, or a complete description of the adverse impact of a recent Federal or State action (e.g.
the closing of a military base). A Federal or State program or action not yet initiated will be considered only where
the application provides documentation establishing the certainty of, and the approximate commencement date of,
the described program or action. 
The proposed CDBG Program must demonstrate clearly the magnitude of the effect of the Federal or State Program or action
on the community. The degree to which the proposed CDBG Program will support the Federal or State Program, and/or the
extent to which the adverse impact of Federal or State action will be mitigated, also must be demonstrated. 
In addition to the above, the nature and costs of the proposed activities will be considered in determining the degree
of impact. 
(j) 

Criterion 10_Supports Energy Production or Conservation.

 This criterion will be judged, and points will be awarded, based upon the community's ability to demonstrate that
the proposed program will support energy production or conservation. Applicants are urged to develop innovative
approaches toward addressing energy needs with Small Cities CDBG funds. 
Energy considerations can be a factor in most activities proposed by smaller communities. Attention should focus
on new methods of producing energy or conserving energy where possible. In developing and evaluating proposals,
there are a number of energy aspects to consider. The following factors will be considered:



_Cost efficiency_Relationship of dollar amount to benefits to be derived. The applicant must document estimates
of energy costs which are to be saved as a result of the proposed program. The proposed program should make maximum use
of non-CDBG resources as well as CDBG funds. Appropriate documentation must be provided to ensure that the proposal
is economically feasible. 
_The extent to which the proposed program will support other programs currently aimed at addressing energy production
or conservation needs of the community. From a management standpoint, proposed projects should be consistent with
needs or objectives of any plan for energy management or conservation. Applicants should pursue the availability
of other resources from Federal or State energy related programs. The degree of commitment of other resources should
be established. State energy offices, private as well as municipally-owned utility companies, and home heating
oil companies may be appropriate entities to be involved in the development and planning of proposals. 
_The application should address whether the project is based on appropriate technology, materials and methods to
maximize energy conservation. Engineering reports or studies would be appropriate evidence to support the overall
feasibility of the project. The conversion of existing facilities, where appropriate, rather than proposing new
construction may be more economical. 
_While housing rehabilitation programs which include weatherization/winterization components will be considered,
they generally will not be presumed as addressing a severe need unless unique conditions are specifically identified
and cost savings are properly documented.

Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Evaluation.

 Documentation for the 65 points for these items is the responsibility of the applicant. Claims of outstanding performance
must be based upon actual accomplishments. Clear, precise documentation will be required. Maps must have a census
tract or block numbering area (BNA), and they must be in accordance with the 1990 Census data. Additionally, maps must
identify the locations of areas with minorities by census tract or BNA. If there are no minority areas, state so on the
map. Only population data from the 1990 Census will be acceptable for purposes of this section. 
Please note that a ``minority'' is a person belonging to, or culturally identified as, a member of any one of the following
racial/ethnic categories: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native. For
the purposes of this section, the separate category_``women'' _is not considered a minority. 
Counties claiming points under this criterion must use county-wide statistics (excluding entitlement communities).
In the case of joint applications, points will be awarded based on the performance of the lead entity only. 
The following factors will be used to judge outstanding performance in these areas. Please note that the criteria
are the same for Comprehensive and Single Purpose applicants, and that points for outstanding performance may be
claimed under each criterion: 
(1) 

Housing Achievements

 (40 points total). 
(a) 20 Points_Provision of Assisted Housing_Providing assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families,
located in a manner which provides housing choice in areas outside of minority, or low- and moderate-income concentrations.

Points will be awarded where both of the following criteria are met: 
(i) More than one-third of the housing assistance provided by the applicant in the last five (5) years (excluding Section
8 existing and housing assistance provided in place) has been in Census Tracts (CT) or Block Numbering Areas (BNA)
having a percentage of minority population which is less than the minority population in the community as a whole;
and 
(ii) With regard to the Section 8 Existing Program, a community must show the location (CT or BNA) of its currently occupied
family units by race/ethnicity. Points will be awarded if more than one-half of the minority assisted families occupy
units in areas which have a lower percentage of minority population than that of the community as a whole. 
A community with no minorities must show the extent to which its assisted housing is located outside areas of concentrations
of low- and moderate-income persons. In order to receive points under this criterion, applicants should follow the
process outlined in (i) and (ii) above, substituting low- and moderate-income persons and families for minority
persons or families. Applicants addressing the first criterion must use a map indicating the location of all assisted
housing and a narrative which indicates the number of units and the type of assisted housing. The map also must show
the general location of low- and moderate-income households and minority households, giving the numbers and percentages
for both. 
To qualify as housing assistance provided, the units being claimed must be part of a project located outside minority
or lower income concentrated areas which has, at a minimum, received a firm commitment from the funding agency. 
(iii) Points also may be awarded for efforts which enable low- and moderate-income persons to remain in their neighborhood
when such neighborhoods are experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment.
Applicants requesting points under this criterion would not need to meet the requirements of (i) and (ii) in order
to receive points. Points will be awarded where more than one half of the families displaced were able to remain in their
original neighborhood through the assistance of the applicant. Applicants must show that:

_the neighborhood experienced revitalization; 
_the amount of displacement was substantial; 
_displacement was caused by private reinvestment; 
_low- and moderate-income persons were permitted to remain in the neighborhood as a result of action taken by the applicant.






If the community is inhabited predominantly by persons who are members of minority and/or low-income groups, points
will be awarded where there is a balanced distribution of assisted housing throughout the community. 
(b) 20 Points - Implementation of a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project or a Fair Housing Strategy
that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project. 
The applicant must demonstrate that it is implementing a HUD-approved New Horizons Fair Housing Assistance Project
or demonstrate participation in a HUD-approved county/State/regional New Horizons Project; or that the applicant
is implementing a fair housing strategy that is equivalent in scope to a New Horizons Project. If the applicant is implementing
a New Horizons Project, it must include:

 

_the date it was approved (by HUD); and 
_those actions taken to implement the plan.



If the applicant is implementing an equivalent fair housing strategy, it must include: 




_the strategy being implemented; 
_those actions taken to implement the strategy. 




Please note that a fair housing strategy must include the four elements of a New Horizons Project in order to be considered
equivalent in scope: 




_Local compliance activities;
_Educational programs to enhance the clarity and understanding of the community's fair housing policy. For communities
with few or no minorities, this should include publication in the surrounding communities of the applicant's policy
of fair housing for minorities and the disabled; 
_Assistance to minority families; and 
_Special programs (e.g. utilization of Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB) Programs, efforts to encourage
local realtors to enter into voluntary agreements to encourage equal access to financial institutions, etc.). 




The fair housing strategy must include goals for each of the above elements. The date of adoption or development of
the strategy should be indicated, as well as the date proposed activities will be or have been implemented. 
(2) 

Entrepreneurial Efforts and Local Equal Employment 

(25 points total). Applicants may request points for both of these subfactors and must use the format sheets included
in the application. 
(a) 

Minority Contracting. 

15 points_Outstanding performance points will be given to those applicants who have demonstrated that they have
utilized minority businesses to the following degree. The applicant must demonstrate that at least five percent
of all its contracts, based on dollar value, have been awarded within the past two years to minority owned and controlled
businesses (businesses that are at least 50 percent owned by minorities) provided that the minority population is
five percent or less. If the minority population exceeds five percent, then the applicant must have a corresponding
percentage of its contracts awarded to minority businesses; however, 20 percent of the total dollar value of its contracts
will be sufficient for award of points for any applicant. The applicable percentage of minority population is the
percentage of minorities in the applicant's jurisdiction, or is the county percentage, whichever is higher.
The applicant must provide the information as outlined in the suggested format, showing the name,
