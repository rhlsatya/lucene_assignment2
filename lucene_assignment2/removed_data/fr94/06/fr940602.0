</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its Business and Industry guaranteed loan program regulations, which
are utilized by the Rural Development Administration (RDA), to provide procedures for interest rate buydown. This
action is needed to implement provisions of the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993. The intended effect is to
provide for payment by the Government of one percentage point of interest on certain guaranteed loans in areas affected
by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to be paid by the borrower.

Environmental Impact Statement 


The action has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' FmHA and RDA
have determined that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190,
an Environmental Impact Statement is not required. 


Discussion of the Rule 


The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993, Public Law 103-50, authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to
transfer certain funds previously authorized by Public Law 102-368 to a program designed to reduce the interest
rate on certain Business and Industry Guaranteed loans. The funds will remain available through fiscal year 1994.
Borrowers must be located in areas affected by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki and Typhoon Omar and unable to make the full
payments on the proposed loan. The interest rate charged by the lender must not exceed the prime rate by more than 100
basis points. The lender will receive payments from the Government to reduce the effective interest rate paid by the
borrower by one percentage point. 


Interim Rule 


It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall
be published for comment notwithstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, we are
making this action effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 without securing prior public comment. This action implements a program authorized by statute and intended to assist
with economic recovery of areas affected by certain natural disasters. The program will only be available for new
loans approved before the funding expires at the end of fiscal year 1994. It is necessary to implement the program as
soon as possible to help stimulate the economy of the disaster area as soon as possible, to provide assistance to struggling
businesses before they are forced to close, and to provide potential applicants the opportunity to develop applications
and have them processed before the funding authority expires. Comments will be accepted for 60 days after publication
and, if appropriate, adjustments will be made in the regulations based on the comments.

 1980.490 

Business and industry buydown loans. 


(a) 

Introduction

. This section contains regulations for the Business and Industry Buydown (BIB) loan program. The purpose of this
program is to provide loan guarantees with reduced interest rates to the borrowers, under the authority of Public
Law 103-50 (107 Stat. 241). All provisions of Subparts A and E of this part apply to BIB loans except as provided
in this section. All forms used in connection with a BIB loan will be those used with other B&I loans, except as provided
in this section. 
(b) 

Location of applicants

. Businesses eligible for BIB loans shall be located within the area covered by the Presidential disaster declaration
related to Hurricanes Andrew or Iniki or Typhoon Omar.

(c) 

Interest rate. 

(1) If the interest rate charged by the lender (note rate) on a BIB loan is a variable rate in accordance with  1980.423
of this subpart, the base rate must be the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal and the note rate must not
exceed the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal by more than 100 basis points. If the note rate is fixed,
it must not exceed by more than 100 basis points the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the day the Loan
Note Guarantee is issued.

(2) The note rate for a BIB loan must be the same for the entire loan, including both the guaranteed and unguaranteed
portion.

(d) 

Interest rate buydown.

 (1) To be eligible for a BIB loan, the business must provide evidence and the lender and FmHA must determine that, at
least for the first year of the loan, the business will not have adequate cash flow to meet all of its financial obligations
including the required payments on the proposed loan at the note rate, but that it can meet all obligations if the interest
rate is reduced by 100 basis points.

(2) During the first year after a Loan Note Guarantee is issued for a BIB loan, FmHA will pay one percentage point of interest
on the loan directly to the lender, thereby reducing the interest due from the borrower by this amount. This interest
payment shall be applied to both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the loan pro ratably according to FmHA
regulations.

(3) Interest payments by FmHA may continue in subsequent years if the borrower's cash flow is insufficient to pay all
obligations including the required payments on the proposed loan at the note rate. On or about each yearly anniversary
of the promissory note the lender may submit a request to FmHA for continued interest payments, along with current
profit and loss and cash flow statements and cash flow projections to show that the continued payments are needed for
another year. FmHA will promptly review the material submitted, determine whether the continued interest payments
by FmHA are needed to provide for sufficient cash flow in the coming year, and notify the lender in writing of the determination.
Once interest payments by FmHA are terminated because the borrower's cash flow is determined to be sufficient to pay
the note rate, such payments will not be made in subsequent years even if the cash flow decreases.

(4) This section does not authorize interest payments by FmHA on B&I loans other than those approved under this
section. To be eligible for interest payments by FmHA, the loan must be designated as a BIB loan when approved and funded
from funds authorized by Public Law 103-50.

(e) 

Duration of BIB loan program. 

No BIB loan will be obligated after September 30, 1994.

(f) 

Administrative procedures.

 (1) A lender that wants a B&I application considered under BIB authorities should so indicate by notation on Form
FmHA 449-1 or by letter submitted with the Form FmHA 449-1.

(2) FmHA will identify a loan as a BIB loan by notation in the top margin of Form FmHA 449-29 and by the ``type of assistance''
code listed on Form FmHA 1940-3, in accordance with the Forms Manual Insert.

(3) FmHA will set out the interest buydown provisions in accordance with this section in the Conditional Commitment
for Guarantee. When the Loan Note Guarantee is issued, the lender and FmHA will execute Form FmHA 1980-48, ``Business
and Industry Interest Rate Buydown Agreement.''

(4) The lender will request the interest payment from FmHA by submitting Form FmHA 1980-23, ``Request for Business
and Industry Interest Buydown Payment,'' to the FmHA servicing office. Each request must cover exactly 1 year and
be filed within 30 days after the anniversary date of the promissory note, except when interest buydown is terminated
between anniversary dates. The FmHA servicing office will review each request for consistency with FmHA regulations
and the Form FmHA 1980-48 and, if the claim is valid, will approve it and forward it to the Finance Office for issuance
of the payment to the lender.

(g) 

Termination of interest buydown. 

When FmHA purchases a portion of a loan, interest buydown will cease on the entire loan. Interest buydown will also
cease upon termination of the Loan Note Guarantee or assumption/transfer of the loan. In the event of any action that
causes the interest buydown to terminate, the lender will submit a claim on Form FmHA 1980-23 for interest buydown
payments through the date of termination.

(h) 

Loan purposes.

 (1) 

Refinancing. 

Section 1980.452 

Administrative

 C.1. (d) of this subpart does not apply to BIB loans if refinancing is needed as a direct consequence of the disaster.
In such cases, the lender may be allowed to bring previously unguaranteed exposure under the guarantee. No loan will
be refinanced unless the current market value of the collateral is at least equal to the amount of the loan to be refinanced
plus any new loan amount.

(2) 

Agriculture. 

Section 1980.412 (e) of this subpart does not apply to BIB loans. BIB loans may be guaranteed for agriculture production,
which means the cultivation, production (growing), and harvesting, either directly or through integrated operations,
of agricultural products (crops, animals, birds, and marine life, either for fiber or food for human consumption),
and disposal or marketing thereof, the raising, housing, feeding (including commercial custom feedlots), breeding,
hatching, control and/or management of farm or domestic animals.

(3) 

Other eligible businesses. 

Eligible types of businesses also include:

(i) Commercial nurseries primarily engaged in the production of ornamental plants and trees and other nursery products
such as bulbs, florists' greens, flowers, shrubbery, flower and vegetable seeds, sod, and the growing of vegetables
from seed to the transplant stage.

(ii) Forestry which includes establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, forest
nurseries, and related activities such as reforestation.

(iii) The growing of mushrooms or hydroponics.

(4) 

Recreation and tourism. 

Loans may be guaranteed for tourist or recreation facilities except for hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, race
tracks, gambling, or golf courses.

(5) 

Meat processing facilities.

 The provisions of  1980.411 (a)(8) of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Loans, including working capital
or debt refinancing, may be guaranteed for businesses engaged in meat or poultry processing. 
(i) 

Small Business Administration.

 Section 1980.451 (c) of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Applicants eligible for Small Business Administration
assistance will be advised of the availability of that assistance. 
(j) 

Loan guarantee limits.

 Notwithstanding the provisions of  1980.420 of this subpart, the guarantee percentage on any BIB loan will
not exceed 80 percent. 
(k) 

Credit quality analysis.

 In analyzing the credit quality of a proposed loan to a business that has lost assets to a natural disaster, primary
emphasis will be placed on the operating history of the business, rather than its current financial condition. If
the business has a sound, profitable and successful history prior to the disaster and there are reasonable projections
to ensure it can operate successfully in the future, the proposed loan may be approved even if disaster losses have
caused somewhat less equity and/or collateral than would normally be expected for a B&I loan guarantee. If the
business appears to have had an unprofitable operation or inadequate cash flow prior to the disaster, the proposed
loan guarantee will not be approved. 
(l) 

Equity requirements.

 The equity requirements of  1980.441 of this subpart do not apply to BIB loans. 
(m) 

Collateral.

 Section 1980.443 Administrative A. 2., 3., and 4. of this subpart will not apply to BIB loans. Collateral may be considered
at its current market value without discount. Work-in-process inventory may be valued at the estimated market value
of the finished product. All costs of producing the finished product must be included in the cash flow analysis. 
(n) 

Conditional approval.

 A Form FmHA 449-14 may be issued prior to receipt of specific items needed to complete an application package
provided: 
(1) The lender and/or borrower demonstrates to the Government's satisfaction that it has a need for a prompt indication
of the availability of the proposed loan guarantee and the conditions under which a guarantee are available; 
(2) The specific items missing from the application package will take considerable time to obtain; 
(3) The lender requests a commitment prior to providing the items; 
(4) The attachment to Form FmHA 449-14 clearly states that the commitment is conditioned on satisfactory completion
of the missing item(s) and a guarantee will not be issued unless all conditions of these regulations are met; and 
(5) No Form FmHA 449-14 will be issued prior to the obligation date established with the Finance Office. 

(o) 

Financial statements.

 All requirements of  1980.451(i)(13) of this subpart will apply except that for BIB loans minimum annual financial
statements will be required as follows: 
(1) For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&I indebtedness of $500,000 or less, an annual compilation by an independent
certified public accountant or by an independent public accountant licensed and certified on or before December
31, 1970. 
(2) For nonagricultural borrowers with a B&I indebtedness of $500,001 through $1 million, an annual review by

 The following additional provisions apply to BIB loan guarantees for businesses engaged in agriculture production:

(1) 

General policy.

 Paragraph (p) of this section contains the regulations for making BIB loans to farmers for agricultural purposes.
BIB loans made for agricultural purposes are subject to the provisions in subparts A and E of this part except as specified.
In addition, certain sections of subpart B of this part referenced in this section are applicable subject to the limitations
outlined in this section. Several key loan processing and loan servicing requirements stipulated in subpart B of
this part do not apply to loans made to borrowers under this section. 

(2) 

Type of guarantee.

 BIB loans will be processed under the Loan Note Guarantee option of  1980.101 (e)(1) of subpart B of this part
Only. No loan will be processed for a Contract of Guarantee (Line of Credit) under  1980.101 (e)(2) of subpart
B of this part. 
(3) 

Farm size.

 Loan guarantees may be made under the BIB program without regard to the size of the farming operation. 
(4) 

Filing and processing preapplications and applications.

 If the applicant has already developed material for an FmHA Farmer Programs loan or if the financial and production
information required by  1980.113 of subpart B of this part is needed to document repayment ability or is required
by the lender,  1980.113 of subpart B of this part may apply with the following exceptions: 
(i) Lines of credit will not be guaranteed. 
(ii) If the application is submitted solely for a farm as defined in  1980.106(b) of subpart B of this part, Form
FmHA 1980-25, ``Farmer Programs Application,'' or Form FmHA 449-1, will be used as an application for
assistance. 
(5) 

Evaluation of applications.

 If the application is developed and processed in accordance with  1980.113 of subpart B of this part, the provisions
outlined in  1980.114 of subpart B of this part apply with the following exceptions: 
(i) Timeframe requirements for the evaluation of applications and references to the Approved Lender Program are
not applicable. 
(ii) County Committee reviews of applications processed under this section will not be required. If the loan approval
official finds the applicant is not eligible, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for disapproval
and his/her rights through inclusion of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) statement. An opportunity will be
given for an appeal as set out in subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter. 
(iii) When applied to BIB applications, references in  1980.114 of this part to ``County Office'' shall normally
be construed to mean ``State Office.'' References to ``County Supervisor'' shall be construed to mean ``Business
and Industry Chief or Community and Business Programs Chief, or other appropriate FmHA official as designated by
the State Director.''

(6) 

Terms of loan repayment. 

(i) Principal and interest on the loan will be due and payable to coincide with the cash flow operating cycle of the business.
Installments will be scheduled for payment as agreed upon by the lender and borrower on terms that reasonably assure

the project is operational and has begun to generate income. However, such installment will be due and payable within
6 years from the date of the debt instrument and at least annually thereafter. Interest will not be deferred and will

Acquisition of Control of Savings Associations; Applications, Approval Standards and Procedural Requirements




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its acquisition of control regulations to implement section 211
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The final rule specifies additional
factors that the OTS must consider in acting on applications to acquire savings associations under section 10(e)
of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA). The intended effect of these amendments is to conform OTS regulations to the statutory
changes. 


In addition, the OTS is amending its acquisition of control regulations to reflect the previous combination of the
various holding company application forms in order to provide consistency between the forms and the regulations,
to eliminate confusion, and to streamline the regulations.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The OTS is adopting a final rule that revises its acquisition of control regulations to include new supervisory factors
that the FDICIA requires the OTS to consider in reviewing and acting on applications to acquire savings associations
under section 10(e) of the HOLA. These changes are required by section 211 of the FDICIA, Public Law 102-242,
105 Stat. 2236. In addition, the OTS is amending its acquisition of control regulations to reflect the previous combination
of the various holding company application forms. 
On November 23, 1993, the OTS issued notice of a proposal to amend the agency's regulations implementing section 10(e)
of the HOLA in accordance with section 211 of the FDICIA, and to amend the acquisition of control regulations to reflect
the combination of the holding company application forms.

1

 The public comment period expired on December 23, 1993. 




Section 211 of the FDICIA provides that the OTS must disapprove an application to acquire a savings association under
section 10(e) of the HOLA: 
(1) If the company fails to provide adequate assurances to the OTS that the company will make available to the OTS such
information on the operations or activities of the company, and any affiliate of the company, as the OTS determines
to be appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with the HOLA; or (2) in the case of an application involving
a foreign bank, if the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis
by appropriate authorities in the bank's home country. 
Section 211 of the FDICIA also provides that the OTS's consideration of the managerial resources of a company or savings
association shall include consideration of the competence, experience and integrity of the officers, directors
and principal shareholders of the company or savings association. 
The OTS is adopting the final rule substantially as proposed. As proposed, the final rule, rather than including a
separate definition of the term ``principal shareholder,'' relies on existing terminology, ``controlling shareholder,''
in the OTS acquisition of control regulations for this purpose, and requires the OTS to consider the competence, experience,
and integrity of ``controlling shareholders.''

2

 




In addition, the final rule provides that the OTS also will consider whether an applicant has provided the OTS with
adequate assurances that it will make available such information on its operations or activities, and the operations
or activities of any affiliate of the applicant, that the OTS deems appropriate to determine and enforce compliance
with the HOLA.

<TEXT>
 

The OTS has determined, in general, not to require additional assurances from domestic applicants. The OTS currently
seeks all information needed to consider holding company applications,

3

 has promulgated regulations and issued forms that require savings and loan holding companies to file information
with the OTS on a regular basis,

4

 and has broad authority under section 10(b) of the HOLA to examine savings and loan holding companies and their affiliates.
In addition, the OTS has broad authority to investigate and bring enforcement actions against holding companies
and other affiliates of savings associations under section 10(g) of the HOLA, as well as other statutory provisions,
including section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Nevertheless, section 10(e)(2)(C) gives the OTS broad
discretion with respect to the circumstances under which additional assurances may be required, as well as the nature
of such assurances, and the OTS may, where appropriate, seek additional assurances regarding the availability of
information from an applicant and its affiliates. 





With respect to holding company applications submitted by foreign acquirors, the OTS has, as a matter of policy, required
foreign acquirors to enter into a foreign acquiror agreement.

5

 Foreign acquiror agreements generally state, 

inter alia, 

that the foreign acquiror (i) voluntarily consents to United States jurisdiction for purposes of laws relating to
United States depository institutions, (ii) shall designate agents in the United States for service of process,
and (iii) shall permit the OTS to examine it to such extent as the Director may prescribe. In addition, as a policy matter,
the OTS and its predecessor, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, have generally required foreign acquirors to establish
a United States holding company as the direct holding company of the acquired savings association. 




The OTS will continue to require foreign acquirors to enter into foreign acquiror agreements, but will not require
further assurances as a general matter. As noted above, the OTS, where appropriate in the context of a particular application,
may seek additional assurances from a foreign acquiror that it will make information available to the OTS concerning
itself or its affiliates. 
In the case of applications involving a foreign bank, the OTS will consider whether the bank is subject to comprehensive
supervision on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the foreign bank's home country. In the proposal,
the OTS requested comment on the standards to be applied in this area, and on whether the OTS should subject foreign
bank holding companies to the same requirement. As the statute refers only to foreign banks, the final rule, as was
the case with the proposal, refers only to foreign banks. 
The regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) implementing section
202(a) of the FDICIA set forth the basis on which the Federal Reserve Board will determine whether a foreign bank is
subject to ``comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis.''

6

 The Federal Reserve Board regulation provides that the Federal Reserve Board will determine whether the foreign
bank is supervised or regulated in such a manner that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information
on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank (including the relationships of the bank to any affiliate) to assess
the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with law and regulation.

<TEXT>
 

The OTS believes that Federal Reserve Board regulations set forth appropriate standards in this area, and is not currently
aware of any compelling reasons to use a standard differing from that used by the Federal Reserve Board. Accordingly,
the final regulation generally incorporates the standard set forth in the Federal Reserve Board's regulations.
OTS believes this approach also will promote regulatory uniformity by applying similar standards to foreign banks
that propose to acquire banks and savings associations.
The OTS also requested comment regarding the manner in which the OTS should implement this standard, 

i.e., 

whether the OTS should conduct a case-by-case analysis, or adopt some other approach, such as a country-by-country,
or regulator-by-regulator approach. The OTS has decided to adopt the approach taken by the Federal Reserve Board.
The Federal Reserve Board has stated that as the standard requires a bank-specific determination, it will address
the standard on a case-by-case basis.

8






II. Summary of Comments


The OTS received two comments regarding the proposed amendments, one from a savings association and one from a thrift
industry trade association. The savings association expressed general support for the proposed rule. The trade
association commenter addressed four issues.
First, the commenter requested that the OTS, in defining the term ``principal shareholder,'' consider alternatives
to the ten percent threshold, and urged the OTS to address the merits of a 25 percent threshold.
The OTS continues to believe that a ten percent threshold is appropriate. Under the OTS acquisition of control regulations,
an individual acquiror generally acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company,
subject to rebuttal, upon acquiring over ten percent of a class of voting stock and acquiring a ``control factor.''

9

 Such an acquiror must submit a change of control notice or rebuttal of control prior to exceeding the ten percent threshold.

10







As the OTS noted in the proposal, the statutory language does not prevent the OTS from considering the extent to which
a ``principal shareholder'' or ``controlling shareholder'' is involved in the affairs of a savings association
or savings and loan holding company. An underlying purpose of section 211 is to permit the OTS to consider the abilities
of the principal shareholders of savings associations and savings and loan holding companies in appropriate situations,
including situations where a principal shareholder has or could have a significant effect on the financial and managerial
resources, future prospects, or safety and soundness of a savings association or savings and loan holding company.
Thus, the OTS, in weighing the shareholder's experience and competence, would give significant consideration to
whether the shareholder proposes to be a passive investor. For instance, a principal shareholder who holds a passive
investment would not need the same level of experience and competence required of a principal shareholder who could
exert significant influence upon the direction of the savings association or savings and loan holding company.
The OTS notes that its approach is similar to the approach taken by the Federal Reserve Board.

11






Second, the commenter responded to the OTS's request for comment as to whether the OTS should seek specific assurances
concerning the operations or activities of an acquiror or its affiliates.

12

 The commenter urged that the OTS not add requirements regarding such assurances to the proposed regulations. As previously
noted, the OTS generally will not require specific assurances regarding these matters.




Third, the commenter responded to the OTS's specific request for comment on the manner in which assurances should
be presented to the OTS as to the availability of information on the operations or activities of certain companies.
The commenter observed that it is a federal crime to file false statements with the OTS, and, therefore, that the assurances
need not take the form of an affidavit or certification.
The OTS has, under various circumstances, required materials to be submitted in the form of an affidavit or certification.
As noted above, the OTS is not generally requiring applicants to provide specific assurances regarding the availability
of information. In the event that the OTS requires additional assurances in a particular case, the OTS will determine
what form of assurance is appropriate under the circumstances.
Fourth, the commenter addressed the OTS's determination of whether a foreign bank is subject to ``comprehensive
supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by the appropriate authorities in the bank's home country.'' The
commenter noted that the OTS has not traditionally made determinations regarding this issue, and urged the OTS to
consider deferring to or otherwise using the resources of the Federal Reserve Board and other banking agencies. The
commenter urged the OTS to take advantage of the expertise of other agencies in this area.
As the OTS must act on applications under section 10(e) of the HOLA, it is the OTS's responsibility to determine whether
the applicant satisfies the applicable standards. Nevertheless, the OTS intends to consider previous determinations
made by the Federal Reserve Board (or other applicable Federal regulatory agency) regarding supervision or regulation
of a foreign bank, and applicants should provide such information to the OTS in the application process. The OTS believes
that consideration of determinations made by other regulatory agencies decreases the burden on applicants to provide
information, and facilitates prompt processing of applications. The OTS recognizes that such determinations may
not be available in every case, because the Federal Reserve Board (and the OTS) make their determinations on a case-by-case
(rather than, 

e.g., 

a country-by-country) basis. In addition, as stated above, the OTS has generally incorporated the Federal Reserve
Board's standards in this area.


III. Executive Order 12866


The Director of the OTS has determined that this proposal does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action''
for purposes of Executive Order 12866.

Small Business Investment Companies; Valuation Guidelines; Correction



<AGENCY>

Small Business Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; correction.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

SBA is correcting the presentation of certain information concerning valuation guidelines which was included in
the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 8, 1994 (59 FR 16933). Certain paragraphs were not printed in bold type as intended.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 8, 1994, SBA published a final rule (59 FR 16933) which included the addition of a new appendix III to part 107
of title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The appendix sets forth valuation guidelines for Small Business Investment
Companies (Licensees). In Section III of appendix III, it was SBA's intention to have certain paragraphs printed
in bold type and other paragraphs printed in regular type. Bold type was intended to identify a model valuation policy
which could be adopted verbatim by Licensees, while regular type was intended to identify supplementary information
which would assist Licensees in interpreting and applying the model policy. When the final rule was printed, however,
none of the text in Section III appeared in bold type.




In order to allow Licensees to distinguish between the model valuation policy and the supplementary information,
SBA is publishing a reorganized version of appendix III. Section III of the reorganized appendix is retitled ``Model
Valuation Policy'' and includes only those paragraphs originally intended to be printed in bold type. A new Section
IV is entitled ``Valuation Policy With Supplementary Information'' and contains both the model and supplementary
paragraphs with no difference in type face. An explanation of the difference between Sections III and IV, and how each
may be used by Licensees, is provided in paragraphs H. and I. of Section II of the appendix.



In FR Doc. 94-7844, published in the 

Federal Register

 on Friday, April 8, 1994, appendix III of 13 CFR part 107 is corrected to read as follows:



Appendix III To Part 107_Valuation Guidelines for SBICs



I. Introduction



This appendix describes the policies and procedures to which Licensees (SBICs and SSBICs) must conform in valuing
their Loans and Investments and provides guidance as to the techniques and standards which are generally applicable
to such valuations.



The need for clearly defined valuation policies and procedures and understandable techniques arises in connection
with the requirement that Licensees report the worth of their portfolios to investors and SBA. This information assists
SBA in its assessment of the overall operational performance and financial condition of individual Licensees and
of the industry.



II. Overall Guidelines



A. Definitions



1. 

Asset Value

 means the amount that the general partners or board of directors of a Licensee have established as a current value in
accordance with its Valuation Policy.

2. 

Marketable Securities

 means securities for which market quotations are readily available and the market is not ``thin'', either in absolute
terms, or relative to the potentially saleable holdings of the Licensee and other investors with saleable blocks
of such securities. These securities are valued as follows: (a) For over-the-counter stocks, taking the average
of the bid price at the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days, and (b) for listed stocks, taking the
average of the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days. This classification does not include securities
which are subject to resale restrictions, either under securities laws or contractual agreements, although other
securities of the same class may be freely marketable.

3. 

Other Securities

 means all Loans and Investments not defined in paragraph A.(2) of this section. Such securities shall be valued at
Asset Value. Most SBIC and SSBIC investments will fall in this classification.

4. 

Valuation Policy 

means the official document of a Licensee that definitively sets forth the Licensee's methods of valuing Loans and
Investments in accordance with the requirements of  101(g) and this appendix.



B. Objective



The goal of a Licensee's valuation process is to value its Loans and Investments. However, the very nature of Licensees'
investments sometimes makes the determination of fair market value problematical. In most cases there is no market
for the investment at the time of valuation. Therefore, except where market quotations are readily available and
the markets are not ``thin'', the Boards of Directors or General Partners are necessarily responsible for determining
in good faith the value of Loans and Investments.

Determination of value will depend upon the circumstances in each case. No exact formula can be devised that will be
generally applicable to the multitude of different valuation issues that will arise. This is especially true for
semiannual valuation updates of relatively new investments for which current results either exceed or do not meet
the Small Concern's forecasts. A sound valuation should be based upon all of the relevant facts, with common sense
and informed judgement influencing the process of weighing those facts and determining their significance in the
aggregate.

C. General Considerations



The Asset Value of Loans and Investments will depend upon the circumstances of each individual case and will be based
upon the nature of the asset and the stage of a company's existence.

In negotiating the terms and conditions of an investment with a Small Concern, the Licensee, in effect, establishes
an initial valuation for the investment, which is cost. Cost shall be the Asset Value until there is a basis to increase
or decrease the valuation.

Unrealized appreciation should be recognized when warranted, but should be limited to those investments that have
a sustained economic basis for an increase in value. Temporary market fluctuations or a temporary increase in earnings
should not be the cause or sole reason for appreciation.

Unrealized depreciation should be recorded when portfolio companies show sustained unfavorable financial performance.
Continuous close scrutiny of Loans and Investments will provide insight into the business cycles and problems encountered
by small business concerns. This insight will allow the Licensee to differentiate between a temporary downturn or
setback and a long-term problem indicating a measurable decline in Asset Value.

When a decline in Asset Value appears permanent, a complete or partial write-off of the asset (i.e., recording a realized
loss rather than unrealized depreciation) should occur. Some of the more obvious indications of permanent impairment
of an investment include the termination of business operations, a petition for bankruptcy protection or liquidation,
or the absence of a verifiable forwarding address of the business or its proprietor(s). Less obvious situations may
include the loss of major revenue accounts, the shut down of a critical distribution channel, an adverse legal or regulatory
ruling, or the expiration of a priority claim on collateral in a distressed Small Concern. These and other possible
circumstances should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with supporting documentation on file.



D. Valuation Responsibility



As specified in 13 CFR 107.101(g), the Licensee's Board of Directors or General Partners have the sole responsibility
for determining Asset Value. In determining Asset Value, the Board of Directors or General Partners must satisfy
themselves that all appropriate factors relevant to a good faith valuation have been considered and that the methods
used are reasonable and prudent and are consistently applied. Although the Board of Directors or General Partners
have the ultimate responsibility for determining Asset Value, they may appoint management or other persons to assist
them in such determinations and to provide supporting data and make the necessary calculations pursuant to the Board's
or General Partners' direction. It is essential that a careful, conservative, yet realistic approach be taken by
Licensees in determining the Asset Value of each Loan and Investment.

As part of the annual audit of the Licensee's financial statements, the Licensee's independent public accountant
has responsibility to review the Licensee's valuation procedures and implementation of such procedures including
adequacy of documentation. The independent public accountant also has reporting responsibility regarding the
results of this review. (See appendix I to this part, section III and section V, paragraphs I and J).



E. Frequency of Valuation



Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate by the Board of Directors or General Partners
at least semiannually_as of the end of the second quarter of Licensee's fiscal year and as of the end of Licensee's fiscal
year, 

Provided however,

 That Licensees without Leverage need only perform valuations once a year. On a case-by-case basis, SBA may require
valuations to be made more frequently. Only valuations performed as of the fiscal year-end are required to be reviewed
by the Licensee's independent public accountant, as discussed in paragraph D. of this section. Each Licensee shall
forward a valuation report to SBA within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year in the case of annual valuations, and within
thirty days following the close of other reporting periods. Material changes in valuations shall be reported not
less often than quarterly within thirty days following the close of the quarter. Since the valuations will only be
as sound as the timeliness of the financial information upon which they are based, Licensees shall require frequent
financial statements from Small Concerns. Monthly financial statements are normally appropriate.



F. Written Valuation Policy

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940602-0-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Each Licensee shall establish a written Valuation Policy approved by its Board of Directors or General Partners that
includes a statement of policies and procedures that are consistent with Section III of this appendix.



G. Documentation



Each Licensee shall prepare and retain in its permanent files a valuation report as of each valuation date documenting,
for each portfolio security, the cost, the current Fair Value and the previous Fair Value, plus the methodology and
supporting data used to determine the value of each such portfolio security. The minutes of meetings of Boards of Directors
or General Partners at which valuations are determined will contain a resolution confirming that the valuations
of each portfolios security were determined in accordance with Licensee's duly adopted valuation procedures and
will incorporate by reference the valuation report signed by each Director or General Partner along with any dissenting
valuation opinions.



H. Instructions



A model Valuation Policy is presented in Section III below. Licensees may adopt the model in its entirety or make appropriate
modifications, additions or deletions. Any changes, however, must be generally consistent with the model.

A second version of the model Valuation Policy is presented in Section IV. This section repeats the language of Section
III, but is expanded to include additional explanatory paragraphs. These paragraphs are commentary provided by
SBA to assist Licensees in interpreting and applying some of the model valuation criteria. They may be adapted for
inclusion in the Licensee's Valuation Policy, if desired.



I. Approval



1. Any Licensee that utilizes the exact wording of Section III, without any additions, deletions, or changes will
be presumed to have an acceptable Valuation Policy. It is acknowledged, however, that this wording may not be entirely
applicable to all Licensees. If a Licensee wants to adopt a Valuation Policy that is different from Section III, the
Licensee must obtain SBA's written approval of such Policy. If changes from the wording of Section III are minor, it
is suggested that the Licensee indicate deletions with a caret (

!

) and underline additions.

2. Applicants for either a Section 301(c) or 301(d) license must submit their Valuation Policies for approval as part
of the licensing application process.



III. Model Valuation Policy



A. General



1. The [Board of Directors] [General Partners] have sole responsibility for determining the Asset Value of each of
the Loans and Investments and of the portfolio in the aggregate.

2. Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate [at least semi-annually_as of the end of
the second quarter of the fiscal year and as of the end of the fiscal year.] [at least annually_as of the end of the fiscal
year.] Fiscal year-end valuations are audited as set forth in 13 CFR Part 107 Appendix III, Section II, paragraph D.

3. This Valuation Policy is intended to provide a consistent, conservative basis for establishing the Asset Value
of the portfolio. The Policy presumes that Loans and Investments are acquired with the intent that they are to be held
until maturity or disposed of in the ordinary course of business.



B. Interest-Bearing Securities



1. Loans shall be valued in an amount not greater than cost, with Unrealized Depreciation being recognized when value
is impaired. The valuation of loans and associated interest receivables on interest-bearing securities should
reflect the portfolio concern's current and projected financial condition and operating results, its payment history
and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments when due.

2. When a valuation relies more heavily on asset versus earnings approaches, additional criteria should include
the seniority of the debt, the nature of any pledged collateral, the extent to which the security interest is perfected,
the net liquidation value of tangible business assets, and the personal integrity and overall financial standing
of the owners of the business. In those instances where a loan valuation is based on an analysis of certain collateralized
assets of a business or assets outside the business, the valuation should, at a minimum, consider the net liquidation
value of the collateral after reasonable selling expenses. Under no circumstances, however, shall a valuation based
on the underlying collateral be considered as justification for any type of loan appreciation.

3. Appropriate unrealized depreciation on past due interest which is converted into a security (or added to an existing
security) should be recognized when collection is doubtful. Collection is 

presumed 

to be in doubt when one or both of the following conditions occur: (i) Interest payments are more than 120 days past due;
or (ii) the small concern is in bankruptcy, insolvent, or there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern.

4. The carrying value of interest-bearing securities shall not be adjusted for changes in interest rates.

5. The valuation of convertible debt may be adjusted to reflect the value of the underlying equity security net of the
conversion price.



c. Equity Securities_Private Companies



1. Investment cost is presumed to represent value except as indicated elsewhere in these guidelines.

2. Valuation should be reduced if a company's performance and potential have significantly deteriorated. If the
factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be restored.

3. The anticipated pricing of a Small Concern's future equity financing should be considered as a basis for recognizing
Unrealized Depreciation, but not for Unrealized Appreciation. If it appears likely that equity will be sold in the
foreseeable future at a price below the Licensee's current valuation, then that prospective offering price should
be weighed in the valuation process.

4. Valuation should be adjusted to a subsequent significant equity financing that includes a meaningful portion
of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. A subsequent significant equity financing that includes
substantially the same group of investors as the prior financing should generally not be the basis for an adjustment
in valuation. A financing at a lower price by a sophisticated new investor should cause a reduction in value of prior
securities.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940602-0-00016 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-0-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. If substantially all of a significant equity financing is invested by an investor whose objectives are in large
part strategic, or if the financing is led by such an investor, it is generally presumed that no more than 50% of the increase
in investment price compared to the prior significant equity financing is attributable to an increased valuation
of the company.
6. Where a company has been self-financing and has had positive cash flow from operations for at least the past two fiscal
years, Asset Value may be increased based on a very conservative financial measure regarding P/E ratios or cash flow
multiples, or other appropriate financial measures of similar publicly-traded companies, discounted for illiquidity.
Should the chosen valuation cease to be meaningful, the valuation may be restored to a cost basis, or in the event of
significant deterioration in performance or potential, to a valuation below cost to reflect impairment.
7. With respect to portfolio companies that are likely to face bankruptcy or discontinue operations for some other
reason, liquidating value may be employed. This value may be determined by estimating the realizable value (often
through professional appraisals or firm offers to purchase) of all assets and then subtracting all liabilities and
all associated liquidation costs.
8. Warrants should be valued at the excess of the value of the underlying security over the exercise price.


D. Equity Securities_Public Companies


1. Public securities should be valued as follows: (a) For over-the-counter stocks, take the average of the bid price
at the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days, and (b) for listed stocks, take the average of the close
for the valuation date and the preceding two days.
2. The valuation of public securities that are restricted should be discounted appropriately until the securities
may be freely traded. Such discounts typically range from 10% to 40%, but the discounts can be more or less, depending
upon the resale restrictions under securities laws or contractual agreements.
3. When the number of shares held is substantial in relation to the average daily trading volume, the valuation should
be discounted by at least 10%, and generally by more.


IV. Valuation Policy With Supplementary Information


A. General


1. The [Board of Directors] [General Partners] have sole responsibility for determining the Asset Value of each of
the Loans and Investments and of the portfolio in the aggregate.
2. Loans and Investments shall be valued individually and in the aggregate [at least semi-annually_as of the end of
the second quarter of the fiscal year and as of the end of the fiscal year.] [at least annually_as of the end of the fiscal
year.] Fiscal year-end valuations are audited as set forth in 13 CFR Part 107, Appendix III, Section II, paragraph
D.
3. This Valuation Policy is intended to provide a consistent, conservative basis for establishing the Asset Value
of the portfolio. The Policy presumes that Loans and Investments are acquired with the intent that they are to be held
until maturity or disposed of in the ordinary course of business.


B. Interest-Bearing Securities


1. Loans shall be valued in an amount not greater than cost, with Unrealized Depreciation being recognized when value
is impaired. The valuation of loans and associated interest receivables on interest-bearing securities should
reflect the portfolio concern's current and projected financial condition and operating results, its payment history
and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments when due.
2. When a valuation relies more heavily on asset versus earnings approaches, additional criteria should include
the seniority of the debt, the nature of any pledged collateral, the extent to which the security interest is perfected,
the net liquidation value of tangible business assets, and the personal integrity and overall financial standing
of the owners of the business. In those instances where a loan valuation is based on an analysis of certain collateralized
assets of a business or assets outside the business, the valuation should, at a minimum, consider the net liquidation
value of the collateral after reasonable selling expenses. Under no circumstances, however, shall a valuation based
on the underlying collateral be considered as justification for any type of loan appreciation.
3. Appropriate unrealized depreciation on past due interest which is converted into a security (or added to an existing
security) should be recognized when collection is doubtful. Collection is presumed to be in doubt when one or both
of the following conditions occur: (i) Interest payments are more than 120 days past due; or (ii) the small concern
is in bankruptcy, insolvent, or there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
a. Licensees may rebut this presumption by providing evidence of collectibility satisfactory to SBA. Such evidence
may include the existence of collateral, the value of which has been verified through an appraisal by an independent
professional appraiser acceptable to SBA. Such an appraisal shall be at liquidation value (net of liquidation costs)
and shall have been performed within the 12 months immediately preceding the valuation date. In considering whether
collateral provides an appropriate basis for valuations, SBA will review the Licensee's operating history for evidence
concerning its willingness and ability to pursue available remedies (including foreclosure) in default situations.
b. For those Licensees primarily involved in making loans, the use of a loan classification system is strongly encouraged
to help manage portfolios and determine Asset Values, with loans that warrant extra attention being flagged by the
Licensee's management. Such a ``watch list'' can also be used to report to the Board of Directors or General Partner(s).
For each loan placed on the watch list, a reason or statement should describe the particular situation. Danger signals
that should alert the Licensee to potential problems include delinquency, a lack of profitability, weak or decreasing
equity, increasing debt load, a deteriorating cash position, an abnormal increase in accounts payable, inaccurate
financial information, insurance cancellation, judgments and tax liens, family problems, loss of employees, collateral
problems, slowdown in inventory turnover, poor maintenance of plant and equipment, and heavy reliance on short term
debt.
c. Upon careful consideration of all the relevant factors, the Board of Directors or General Partners shall determine
which loans require recognition of Unrealized Depreciation. It is a good rule of operation for a Licensee to perform
downward valuations earlier rather than later. When the quality of a loan recovers, a higher Asset Value may subsequently
be assigned.
4. The carrying value of interest-bearing securities shall not be adjusted for changes in interest rates.
5. The valuation of convertible debt may be adjusted to reflect the value of the underlying equity security net of the
conversion price.
a. Accepted methods for valuing convertible debentures generally involve one of two approaches. The first approach
views the debenture as a debt obligation. Under this approach, the Licensee should utilize the loan valuation techniques
described in this section above. The second approach considers the conversion of all convertible securities of the
same class into their common stock equivalent, taking into account dilution, and a subsequent valuation of the Licensee's
proportionate equity interest. Valuation of this equity interest should follow the equity valuation techniques
described in Paragraph C. of this section.
b. Normally, the reported value is the higher of these two alternatives. However, Licensees should disregard higher
equity values and retain lower debt-based valuations if there are circumstances which make conversion undesirable.
When equity considerations govern the Asset Value assigned, all underlying factors should be disclosed.

1. Investment cost is presumed to represent value except as indicated elsewhere in these guidelines.
2. Valuation should be reduced if a company's performance and potential have significantly deteriorated. If the
factors which led to the reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be restored.
3. The anticipated pricing of a Small Concern's future equity financing should be considered as a basis for recognizing
Unrealized Depreciation, but not for Unrealized Appreciation. If it appears likely that equity will be sold in the
foreseeable future at a price below the Licensee's current valuation, then that prospective offering price should
be weighed in the valuation process.
4. Valuation should be adjusted to a subsequent significant equity financing that includes a meaningful portion
of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. A subsequent significant equity financing that includes
substantially the same group of investors as the prior financing should generally not be the basis for an adjustment
in valuation. A financing at a lower price by a sophisticated new investor should cause a reduction in value of prior
securities.
5. If substantially all of a significant equity financing is invested by an investor whose objectives are in large
part strategic, or if the financing is led by such an investor, it is generally presumed that no more than 50% of the increase
in investment price compared to the prior significant equity financing is attributable to an increased valuation
of the company.
6. Where a company has been self-financing and has had positive cash flow from operations for at least the past two fiscal
years, Asset Value may be increased based on a very conservative financial measure regarding P/E ratios or cash flow
multiples, or other appropriate financial measures of similar publicly-traded companies, discounted for illiquidity.
Should the chosen valuation cease to be meaningful, the valuation may be restored to a cost basis, or in the event of
significant deterioration in performance or potential, to a valuation below cost to reflect impairment.
a. Under these conditions, valuation factors that may be considered include:
(1) The utilization of a multiple of earnings, cash flow, or revenues, which are commensurate with the multiples which
the market currently accords to comparable companies in similar businesses and industries, with an appropriate
discount for conditions such as illiquidity or a minority position. Care should be taken to use only comparable companies,
including not only business similarities but also similarities as to size, financial condition, and earnings outlook.
However, in order for comparative market prices to be meaningful, data for a representative sample of similar companies
must be available.
(2) Among the more important factors to be considered in a particular case are (i) the nature of the business, (ii) the
risk involved, and (iii) the growth, stability or irregularity of earnings and cash flows. A company with a positive
earnings trend and a favorable outlook may command a capitalization factor (multiplier) in the marketplace that
will result in a stock valuation well above book value. When the gross value of a small concern is computed by applying
a capitalization rate to pre-interest, pre-tax earnings, the value of equity securities is derived by subtracting
the outstanding debt of the concern from the gross value. While capitalization rates do vary, an appropriate rate
can be determined by analyzing rates for comparable companies in the same industry. Investigating similar companies
in the same industry or geographic area can be done directly or through published material from sources such as the
Value Line, Standard and Poor's, Robert Morris and Associates, or any other of the numerous sources available for
comparative industry data.
(3) Another method discounts the present value of estimated future proceeds to a Licensee, including dividend income
and sales of securities, using a discount rate that reflects the degree of risk of the equity interest.
(4) One may also utilize the recent sale prices of comparable blocks of the issuer's securities in arm's length transactions.
b. Equity interests or limited partnership interests without the benefit of stock certificates and which generally
define a certain percentage of the profits to be allocated to each of the investors based on its relative contributions
should be valued in a manner similar to the valuation methods described in this section.
7. With respect to portfolio companies that are likely to face bankruptcy or discontinue operations for some other
reason, liquidating value may be employed. This value may be determined by estimating the realizable value (often
through professional appraisals or firm offers to purchase) of all assets and then subtracting all liabilities and
all associated liquidation costs.

a. Liquidation value will depend on the decreasing value of wasting assets, the costs experienced by the business
being liquidated, the expenses borne by the Licensee in order to be able to realize any liquidating value, the elapsed
time until such net proceeds can be realized, the ranking of the Licensee's claims relative to other security interests
and subordination agreements, and the probability of any ultimate realization of value.

b. Incorporating this approach as a normal step in valuation can provide improved understanding of the downside of
an investment.

c. Licensees should recognize unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as appropriate, on Assets Acquired in Liquidation
of Loans and Investments. In order to recognize Unrealized Appreciation, asset values must be verified by an appraisal
which meets all the conditions specified in the preceding paragraph; 

Provided, however,

 that if the assets acquired constitute a going concern, such assets may be appraised as a going concern rather than
at liquidation value. Unrealized Appreciation may not be recognized if the Licensee does not benefit from such appreciation.
For example, an asset acquired through foreclosure should not be carried at a value greater than the defaulted loan
balance plus any expenses and penalties to which the Licensee is entitled.

8. Warrants should be valued at the excess of the value of the underlying security over the exercise price. 

a. Valuation of debt with detachable warrants can be done similarly to convertible debt by treating the debt and warrants
as a unit, or, alternatively, the debt can be valued on its own basis as a debt instrument, and the warrants separately.
If the warrants are valued separately, the following factors must be taken into account:

(1) Current value of issued shares.

(2) The differential between the exercise private and the underlying share values if the current share values are
higher than the exercise price.

(3) Time until expiration dates are reached or dates of changes in terms of exercise prices.

(4) Number of shares into which the warrants are exercisable on various dates.

(5) Restrictions on sale of the underlying stock.

(6) Restrictions on the transferability of the warrants.

(7) Registration rights for the warrants or the underlying shares.

(8) Financial ability of the Licensee to perform the exercise of its rights or to sell its warrants.

(9) The ultimate desirability, if any, of exercising the rights given by the warrants.



D. Equity Securities_Public Companies



1. Public securities should be valued as follows: (a) For over-the-counter stocks, take the average of the bid price
at the close for the valuation date and the preceding two days, and (b) for listed stocks, take the average of the close
for the valuation date and the preceding two days.

a. However, securities are not deemed to be freely marketable in those situations where such securities are very thinly
or infrequently traded, or may be lacking in truly representative market quotations, or where the market for such
securities cannot absorb the quantity of shares which the Licensee and similar investors may want to sell.

b. In such cases, Asset Value must be determined by the Board of Directors or General Partners.

2. The valuation of public securities that are restricted should be discounted appropriately until the securities
may be freely traded. Such discounts typically range from 10% to 40%, but the discounts can be more or less, depending
upon the resale restrictions under securities laws or contractual agreements.

3. When the number of shares held is substantial in relation to the average daily trading volume, the valuation should
be discounted by at least 10%, and generally by more.

Airworthiness Directives; British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 Series Airplanes 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11-200
and -400 series airplanes, that requires inspection of the landing gear brakes for wear, and replacement of
the brakes if the wear limits prescribed in this amendment are not met. This amendment also requires that the specified
maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment
is prompted by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable
to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport
category airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during
a high energy RTO.

 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all British Aerospace Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3798). That action proposed to require the inspection of certain landing gear brakes for
wear, and the replacement of brakes if the wear limits prescribed in the proposal are not met. That action also proposed
that the specified maximum brake wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.





Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 


One commenter supports the proposal. 


Another commenter requests that NOTE 2 of the proposal be clarified. This 
commenter points out that proposed NOTE 2 states, ``* * * Brake units having wear indicators set at
1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either wear indicator pin is 1.0 inch or less above the surface of the
carrier. * * *'' In effect, this wording permits a total brake wear (from new to fully worn brake) of
only 0.06 inch. This clearly is incorrect. This commenter states that a correctly set wear indicator pin protrudes
above the surface of the carrier when in normal operation, but will be flush with the surface when the brake is fully
worn. Thus, the dimension by which the pin protrudes above the surface of the carrier is the amount of wear still available.
Therefore, a wear indicator pin set for the existing limit of 1.06 inch will protrude above the surface of the carrier
by 0.06 inch when the new wear limit of 1.00 inch is reached. The FAA concurs and has revised NOTE 2 of the final rule to
clarify this point. 


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 


There are approximately 100 Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. 


The FAA estimates that 10 Model BAC 1-11-200 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators of these
airplanes will be affected by this proposed AD. For these airplanes and operators, although the rule requires the
incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific
additional action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement is involved; such actions
are currently a part of the current maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it will take approximately
1 work hour, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision into its FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the requirement to revise the FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1-11-200 series airplanes is estimated
to be $110, or $55 per operator. 


The FAA estimates that 20 Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 19 U.S. operators of
these airplanes will be affected by this AD. It is estimated that it will take approximately 1 work hour, at an average
labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision into its FAA-approved maintenance inspection
program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1-11-400
series airplanes is estimated to be $1,045, or $55 per operator.

<DOCNO> FR940602-0-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-0-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, the FAA estimates that for operators of Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes, it will take
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to shorten the wear pins for replacement brakes, and 8 work hours per airplane
to change the brakes, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change
in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they
are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) is estimated to be $912 per airplane. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of these requirements on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1-11-400 series airplanes
is estimated to be $29,240, or $1,462 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of
the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were
not adopted. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

Adoption of the Amendment 


Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration
amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 


PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 


1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:

 



Authority:

 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. 


 39.13


[Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:

 



94-11-07 British Aerospace: 

Amendment 39-8923. Docket 93-NM-167-AD.

 



Applicability: 

All Model BAC 1-11-200 and -400 series airplanes, certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy rejected takeoff (RTO), accomplish the following:

(a) Within 180 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD. 
(1) Inspect main landing gear brakes having the brake part numbers listed below for wear. Any brake worn more than the
maximum wear limit specified below must be replaced, prior to further flight, with a brake within that limit. 


 

Note 1: 

Measuring instructions for Bendix brakes can be found in Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual.

 



Note 2: 

Revision 4 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual 
specifies a brake wear limit of 1.06 inch for brake part number 2601240-1. That brake wear limit is superseded
by the brake wear limit of 1.0 inch specified above for that brake part number. Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component
Maintenance Manual will reflect the revised brake wear limit of 1.0 inch. Brake units having wear indicators set at
1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either wear indicator pin is 0.06 inch or less above the surface of
the carrier, provided the wear indicator pin has not been shortened on that brake unit.

 



Note 3: 

Each operator should provide a method of identifying modified brakes until Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component
Maintenance Manual has been issued. Revision 5 of the manual will define a method of brake identification and reflect
the brake wear limits specified above. A paint scheme similar to that used to differentiate between new and refurbished
brakes could be used, for example, if a different color is used.

 

(2) Incorporate into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program the 
maximum brake wear limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this AD. 
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments
and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113.

 



Note 4: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.

 

(c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(d) This amendment becomes effective on July 5, 1994.

Modification of Class E Airspace; Sault Ste. Marie, MI



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies Class E airspace at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan to change the controlled airspace operations
from part-time to continuous operation. Controlled airspace to the surface, and a control zone is needed for instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at the Chippewa County International Airport. Currently, at least half of the operations
at Chippewa County International Airport are scheduled during the times when the Class E2 airspace is inactive (uncontrolled).
The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators at Chippewa County International
Airport.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History



On March 29, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class
E2 airspace from part-time use to continuous use at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. This modification provides adequate
controlled airspace to accommodate existing operations at Chippewa County International Airport. Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will
be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies Class E2 airspace at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan
to provide adequate controlled airspace to accommodate existing operations at Chippewa County International Airport.
The modification changes the operations from part-time use to continuous use operations.

Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only effect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Standard Instrument Approach Procedures; Miscellaneous Amendments



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPS). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and  97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260-3, 8260-4, and 8260-5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.



The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 

Federal Register

 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. This, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification, and the amendment
number.



The Rule



This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.

Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; notice of legislation and of address for submission of certifications.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the address to which a person should submit certifications made
pursuant to Pub. L. 103-261. The public law extends the time period for compliance with certain provisions of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) but makes the extension contingent upon the submission of a certification
to FDA. This notice is published in response to the passage of Pub. L. 103-261. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

President Clinton has signed into law Pub. L. 103-261. This law extends the time period for food products to comply
with section 403(q) and 403(r)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q) and 343(r)(2)), and with the provision of section 403(i)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(i)) that was added by section 7(2) of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) (21 U.S.C.
343), until after August 8, 1994. This delay is contingent, however, on the person who introduces the product, or delivers
it for introduction, into interstate commerce submitting before June 15, 1994, a certification to the Secretary
of Health and Human Services that such person will comply with Pub. L. 103-261 and with section 403(q) and 403(r)(2)
of the act, and the provision of section 403(i) of the act referenced above, after August 8, 1994.

Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Ohio 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 USEPA is deleting all total suspended particulate (TSP) area designations in the State of Ohio. This direct final
action was prompted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's request to redesignate all areas in the State,
except for Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County, from TSP nonattainment to attainment. Section 107(d)(4)(B)
of the Clean Air Act (CAA) authorizes USEPA to eliminate all area TSP designations once the increments for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microns are promulgated. On June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31622), USEPA published
the final rulemaking revising the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) particulate matter increments
so that the increments are measured in terms of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal
to 10 microns (respirable particulate matter). The June 3, 1993 final rulemaking also establishes the method by which
USEPA deletes such TSP designations. Today's action becomes effective on June 3, 1994, the effective date of the respirable
particulate matter increments. 


Please note that for this action, the term ``respirable particulate matter'' only applies to particulate matter
with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 microns. ``Respirable particulate matter'' is not to be confused
with particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


In 1971, USEPA promulgated primary and secondary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter to be measured as TSP. On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634), USEPA revised the NAAQS for particulate matter, replacing
the TSP indicator with the respirable particulate matter indicator. The particulate matter standard was revised
under the authority of Section 109(d) of the CAA, which requires periodic review and, if appropriate, revision of
existing criteria and standards. 
In a related rulemaking published in the July 1, 1987, 

Federal Register

 (52 FR 24672), the Agency determined that the respirable particulate matter standard would be implemented pursuant
to section 110 of the CAA. As a result, the area designation process of section 107 and the nonattainment provisions
of Part D did not apply to the respirable particulate matter NAAQS. Consequently, TSP designations were retained
as a means of differentiating areas needing nonattainment area new source review as opposed to attainment area prevention
of significant deterioration review and to provide for attainment area increment tracking. 

In the 1990 amendments to the CAA, section 107 established designations of attainment status for respirable particulate
matter. In addition, section 107(d)(4)(B) expressly states that any designation for particulate matter (measured
in terms of TSP) that the Administrator promulgated prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments shall remain in effect
for purposes of implementing the particulate matter (measured in terms of TSP) increments until the Administrator
determines that such designation is no longer 
necessary for that purpose. Section 166(f) authorizes USEPA to replace the TSP increment with respirable particulate
matter increments. 

Upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County were designated
as nonattainment areas for respirable particulate matter. These two areas, as well as seven other areas within the
State, had previously been designated TSP nonattainment areas. Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson County
will remain designated as nonattainment areas for respirable particulate matter.

On June 3, 1993 (58 FR 31622), USEPA published the final rulemaking revising the particulate matter increments so
that they are measured in terms of respirable particulate matter. As a result of the rulemaking, the PSD increments
and NAAQS for particulate matter will be measured by the same indicator. The final rulemaking also establishes the
method by which USEPA will delete TSP area designations. 

As stated at 58 FR 31635, the deletion of TSP area designations for each State will occur at the same time that USEPA (1)
approves a State's revised PSD program containing the respirable particulate matter increments, (2) promulgates
the PM-10 increments into a State's SIP when the State chooses not to adopt the increments on their own, or (3)
approves a State's request for delegation of PSD responsibility under  52.21(u). For States already having
delegated authority to implement the Federal PSD regulations, the rulemaking states that ``USEPA will eliminate
the TSP designations when the PM-10 increments become effective under  52.21 on June 3, 1994.'' 

USEPA has delegated to the State of Ohio the authority to implement the PSD program. The delegation agreement provides
for automatic adoption of the revised respirable particulate matter increments once the increment becomes effective.
On August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41218), USEPA proposed to approve the State of Ohio's regulations providing for attainment
of respirable particulate matter air quality standards in areas that are currently designated nonattainment and
unclassifiable for respirable particulate matter. 

USEPA interprets section 107(d)(4)(B) of the CAA to allow elimination of all TSP area designations once the respirable
particulate matter increments are promulgated. The respirable particulate matter increments will become effective
June 3, 1994 and would automatically be delegated for implementation by the State of Ohio. USEPA finds that the promulgation
of the respirable particulate matter increments and USEPA's proposed approval of Ohio's 
respirable particulate matter SIP fulfills the criteria for eliminating TSP area designations altogether. 

Although the OEPA requested redesignation of all areas in the State, except Cuyahoga County and Jefferson County,
from TSP nonattainment to attainment, USEPA believes that it is administratively more efficient to delete TSP area
designations totally since the deletion eliminates the need for two rulemaking proceedings. If USEPA were to redesignate
the TSP nonattainment areas at this time, the Agency would then have to promulgate another rulemaking on or after June
3, 1994, when the respirable particulate matter PSD increments become effective. 
USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because, due to the change from TSP to respirable particulate
matter under the particulate matter regulatory scheme, the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and
anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective June 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication,
notice is received that adverse critical comments will be submitted. 

If such notice of comments is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing two subsequent
notices. A notice would be published withdrawing the final action, and another notice would begin a new rulemaking
by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public
is advised that this action will be effective on June 3, 1994.

Final Action 


USEPA is taking action to delete all TSP area designations in the State of Ohio since the Agency believes it is administratively
more efficient than redesignating the TSP nonattainment areas, except for Cuyahoga County and a portion of Jefferson
County, to attainment. Deletion of the TSP area delegations at this time eliminates the need for two rulemaking proceedings
and has the same effect as redesignating TSP nonattainment areas to attainment. Nothing in this action should be construed
as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for
revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors
and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The Agency has reviewed this action for conformance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 enacted
on November 15, 1990 and determined that this action conforms with the statute as amended. The Agency has examined
the issue of whether this action should be reviewed only under the provisions of the law as it existed on the date of submittal
to the Agency (i.e., prior to November 15, 1990) and has determined that the Agency must apply the new law. 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency
must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action''
as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal
governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
OMB has exempted the regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
USEPA's action under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable
to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this action. Moreover, USEPA's action
does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose
any new Federal requirements. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 1, 1994. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings
to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Tolerance Processing Fees 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule increases fees charged for processing tolerance petitions for pesticides under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The change in fees reflects a 4.23 percent increase in locality pay for civilian Federal
General Schedule (GS) employees working in the Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD metropolitan area in 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The EPA is charged with administration of section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Section
408 authorizes the Agency to establish tolerance levels and exemptions from the requirements for tolerances for
raw agricultural commodities. Section 408(o) requires that the Agency collect fees as will, in the aggregate, be
sufficient to cover the costs of processing petitions for pesticide products, i.e., that the tolerance process be
as self-supporting as possible.



The current fee schedule for tolerance petitions (40 CFR 180.33) was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 16094) and became effective on April 23, 1993. At that time the fees were increased 3.7 percent
in accordance with a provision in the regulation that provides for automatic annual adjustments to the fees based
on annual percentage changes in Federal salaries. The specific language in the regulation is contained in paragraph
(o) of 180.33 and reads in part as follows: 




(o) This fee schedule will be changed 
 
annually by the same percentage as the 
 
percent change in the Federal General 
 
Schedule (GS) pay scale***. When automatic 
 
adjustments are made based on the GS pay 
 
scale, the new fee schedule will be 
 
published in the 

Federal Register

 as a 
 
final rule to become effective thirty days 
 
or more after publication, as specified in 
 
the rule. 



 

The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) initiated locality-based comparability pay, known
as ``locality pay.'' The intent of the legislation is to make Federal pay more responsive to local labor market conditions
by adjusting General Schedule salaries on the basis of a comparison with non-Federal rates on a geographic, locality
basis. 
 
The processing and review of tolerance petitions is conducted by EPA employees working in the Washington, DC/Baltimore,
MD pay area. The pay raise in 1994 for Federal General Schedule employees working in the Washington, DC/Baltimore,
MD metropolitan pay area is 4.23 percent; therefore, the tolerance petition fees are being increased 4.23 percent.
The entire fee schedule, 180.33, is presented for the reader's convenience. (All fees have been rounded to the nearest
$25.00.)

be accompanied by a fee of $13,400 plus $900 for each raw agricultural commodity on which a tolerance is requested.

 
(c) Each petition or request for an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance or repeal of an exemption shall be
accompanied by a fee of $10,800. 
 
(d) Each petition or request for a temporary tolerance or a temporary exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
shall be accompanied by a fee of $23,400 except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. A petition or request to
renew or extend such temporary tolerance or temporary exemption shall be accompanied by a fee of $3,325. 
 
(e) A petition or request for a temporary tolerance for a pesticide chemical which has a tolerance for other uses at
the same numerical level or a higher numerical level shall be accompanied by a fee of $11,675 plus $900 for each raw agricultural
commodity on which the temporary tolerance is sought. 
 
(f) Each petition or request for repeal of a tolerance shall be accompanied by a fee of $7,325. Such fee is not required
when, in connection with the change sought under this paragraph, a petition or request is filed for the establishment
of new tolerances to take the place of those sought to be repealed and a fee is paid as required by paragraph (a) of this
section. 
 
(g) If a petition or a request is not accepted for processing because it is technically incomplete, the fee, less $1,450
for handling and initial review, shall be returned. If a petition is withdrawn by the petitioner after initial processing,
but before significant Agency scientific review has begun, the fee, less $1,450 for handling and initial review,
shall be returned. If an unacceptable or withdrawn petition is resubmitted, it shall be accompanied by the fee that
would be required if it were being submitted for the first time. 
 
(h) Each petition or request for a crop group tolerance, regardless of the number of raw agricultural commodities
involved, shall be accompanied by a fee equal to the fee required by the analogous category for a single tolerance that
is not a crop group tolerance, i.e., paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, without a charge for each commodity
where that would otherwise apply. 
 
(i) Objections under section 408(d)(5) of the Act shall be accompanied by a filing fee of $2,925. 
 
(j)(1) In the event of a referral of a petition or proposal under this section to an advisory committee, the costs shall
be borne by the person who requests the referral of the data to the advisory committee. 
 
(2) Costs of the advisory committee shall include compensation for experts as provided in  180.11(c) and the expenses
of the secretariat, including the costs of duplicating petitions and other related material referred to the committee.

 
(3) An advance deposit shall be made in the amount of $29,225 to cover the costs of the advisory committee. Further advance
deposits of $29,225 each shall be made upon request of the Administrator when necessary to prevent arrears in the payment
of such costs. Any deposits in excess of actual expenses will be refunded to the depositor. 
 
(k) The person who files a petition for judicial review of an order under section 408(d)(5) or (e) of the Act shall pay
the costs of preparing the record on which the order is based unless the person has no financial interest in the petition
for judicial review. 
 
(l) No fee under this section will be imposed on the Inter-Regional Research Project Number 4 (IR-4 Program).

 
(m) The Administrator may waive or refund part or all of any fee imposed by this section if the Administrator determines
in his or her sole discretion that such a waiver or refund will promote the public interest or that payment of the fee
would work an unreasonable hardship on the person on whom the fee is imposed. A request for waiver or refund of a fee shall
be submitted in writing to the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division
(7505C), Washington, DC 20460. A fee of $1,450 shall accompany every request for a waiver or refund, except that the
fee under this sentence shall not be imposed on any person who has no financial interest in any action requested by such
person under paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section. The fee for requesting a waiver or refund shall be refunded
if the request is granted. 
 
(n) All deposits and fees required by the regulations in this part shall be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified
check drawn to the order of the Environmental Protection Agency. All deposits and fees shall be forwarded to the Environmental
Protection Agency, Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs (Tolerance Fees),
P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The payments should be specifically labeled ``Tolerance Petition Fees''
and should be accompanied only by a copy of the letter or petition requesting the tolerance. The actual letter or petition,
along with supporting data, shall be forwarded within 30 days of payment to the Environmental Protection Agency,
Office of Pesticide Programs, Registration Division, (7504C) Washington, DC 20460. A petition will not be accepted
for processing until the required fees have been submitted. A petition for which a waiver of fees has been requested
will not be accepted for processing until the fee has been waived or, if the waiver has been denied, the proper fee is
submitted after notice of denial. A request for waiver or refund will not be accepted after scientific review has begun
on a petition. 
 
(o) This fee schedule will be changed annually by the same percentage as the percent change in the Federal General Schedule
(GS) pay scale. In addition, processing costs and fees will periodically be reviewed and changes will be made to the
schedule as necessary. When automatic adjustments are made based on the GS pay scale, the new fee schedule will be published
in the Federal Register

 as a Final Rule to become effective 30 days or more after publication, as specified in the rule. When changes are made
based on periodic reviews, the changes will be subject to public comment.

Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes From Wood Surface Protection;
Correction 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice contains corrections to the final regulation (FRL-4804-9) which was published Tuesday,
January 4, 1994 (``Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes from
Wood Surface Protection; Final Rule'', 59 FR 458). This notice corrects inaccurate references in that Final Rule
to the EPA Publication SW-846, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods''.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The final regulation that is the subject of this correction (January 4, 1994, 59 FR 458) amended the hazardous waste
regulations by adding the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol to appendix VIII
of 40 CFR part 261. The final regulations also amended EPA Publication SW-846, ``Test Methods for Evaluating
Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' by adding Method 4010 to the Third Edition of SW-846 as Update IIA.
SW-846 contains the analytical and test methods that EPA has evaluated and found to be among those acceptable
for testing under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. The Agency added
Method 4010 to SW-846 as an appropriate method, in general, for testing for the presence of the sodium and potassium
salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol which, as noted above, were added by the final rule to appendix
VIII of 40 CFR part 261. 

In the final regulation of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 458), the Agency amended 40 CFR 260.11(a) to incorporate by reference
both Update IIA (Method 4010) and Update II of SW-846; and to indicate that these updates are available from the
U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). These amendments to 40 CFR 260.11 contain two technical errors: (1) Update
II of SW-846 is still being developed by EPA and was not promulgated by the final regulations of January 4, 1994,
or by any other regulation to date, and is not available from GPO; and (2) Update IIA (Method 4010), although promulgated
by the January 4, 1994 rule, is also not available from the GPO. 



Need for Correction 



As published, the final regulations of January 4, 1994 were in advertent error with respect to the incorporation by
reference of Update II of SW-846, Third Edition, into the hazardous waste regulations at 40 CFR 260.11(a). The
regulations were also in inadvertent error with respect to the availability of Updates II and IIA from the U.S. Government
Printing Office. These errors, therefore, need correction. Because this action is a technical correction, prior
notice and opportunity for comment is unnecessary, and good cause exists for this change to take effect immediately
(see 5 U.S.C. 553(6)). Accordingly, the Agency is not seeking any comments based on today's notice. 



Correction of Publication 



Accordingly, the publication on January 4, 1994 of the final regulation, 59 FR 458, ``Hazardous Waste Management
System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes from Wood Surface Protection; Final Rule'' (FRL-4804-9),
which was the subject of FR Doc. 93-32032, is corrected. Specifically, on page 468, in the third column,  260.11(a)
is corrected to read as follows: 



 260.11 

References [corrected]. 



(a) * * * 

``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW-846 [Third Edition
(November, 1986), as amended by Updates I and IIA]. The Third Edition of SW-846 and Update I (document number
955-001-00000-1) are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing
Office, Washington, DC 20402, (202) 783-3238; and Update IIA is available from the Office of Solid Waste (Mailcode

Changes in Flood Elevation Determinations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Modified base (100-year) flood elevations are finalized for the communities listed below. These modified elevations
will be used to calculate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings and their contents. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency makes the final determinations listed below of the final determinations
of modified base (100-year) flood elevations for each community listed. These modified elevations have been published
in newspapers of local circulation and ninety (90) days have elapsed since that publication. The Associate Director
has resolved any appeals resulting from this notification. 



The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are not listed for each community in this notice. However, this rule
includes the address of the Chief Executive Officer of the community where the modified base (100-year) flood elevation
determinations are available for inspection. 


The modifications are made pursuant to Section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 

et seq., 

and with 44 CFR part 65. 


For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.



The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). 


These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, State, or regional entities. 

These modified elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP and are also used to
calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations are made
final, and for the contents in these buildings. 


The changes in base (100-year) flood elevations are in accordance with 44 CFR 65.4. 




National Environmental Policy Act. 

This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental
impact assessment has been prepared. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this rule is exempt from the requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act because modified base (100-year) flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and are required to maintain community eligibility in the NFIP. No regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared. 




Regulatory Classification. 

This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. 




Executive Order 12612, Federalism. 

This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated
October 26, 1987. 




Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. 

This rule meets the applicable standards of Section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; correction.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 30, 1994, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published a final rule that amended certain provisions
of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Acquisition Regulation (FEHBAR). The regulations were effective immediately
upon publication and OPM intended that they would apply for the first time to the 1995 FEHB contract (rate) year. Upon
publication, we found two references in the Supplementary Information Section with regard to the effective date
that we believe will be confusing to FEHB carriers. We are publishing the following corrections to clarify our intent
and eliminate the ambiguity.



In the 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

 section beginning on 59 FR 14761, in the issue of Wednesday, March 30, 1994, make the following corrections:

(1) On page 14762, in the 2nd column, the first full paragraph, in the fifth line, ``1994'' should read ``1995.''

(2) On page 14763, in the lst column, the first full paragraph, last sentence should read, ``These regulations will
be in effect beginning with the 1995 rate year.''

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule incorporates into the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) a number of changes based on rulemaking
petitions from industry and RSPA initiative. These changes are necessary to recognize recent editions of certain
matter incorporated by reference, to eliminate certain inconsistencies and typographical errors, and to reinstate
a shipping description. The intended effect of these regulatory changes is to improve clarity and, consequently,
reduce confusion.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule makes changes to the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171-180) based on either
requests from industry or agency initiative. These changes clarify and correct certain inconsistencies appearing
in the HMR, add a specific shipping description currently authorized by approval, and update certain standards incorporated
by reference under  171.7. These changes impose no new requirements on persons subject to the HMR and do not adversely
affect safety. 



The following is a discussion of the changes made under this final rule. 



Section 171.7 



RSPA received several requests to update various standards currently incorporated by reference in the table contained
in  171.7(a)(3). These standards are as follows: 




The Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education requested RSPA to incorporate into the HMR the latest American National
Standards Institute, Inc. (ANSI) pamphlet, ANSI N14.1-1990, entitled ``Uranium Hexafluoride_Packaging
for Transport.'' Incorporating the 1990 edition of the standard into the HMR will enhance uranium hexafluoride transportation
safety by recognizing the use of packagings fabricated to certain updated industrial specifications and standards.
The 1990 standard also contains specific information on the reuse of valves and various editorial clarifications.
Section 173.420 of the HMR permits uranium hexafluoride to be transported in packagings designed, fabricated, inspected,
tested and marked in accordance with certain DOT and industry standards that include packagings fabricated to the
ANSI N14.1 (1987, 1982, or 1971 edition) in effect at the time the packaging was manufactured. This section also provides
that, before initial filling and during periodic inspection and test, the packagings must be cleaned in accordance
with the ANSI N14.1 requirements. 

The American Pyrotechnic Association (APA) petitioned (P-1174) to update APA Standard 87-1, entitled
``Standard for Construction and Approval for Transportation of Fireworks and Novelties,'' from the September 1987
edition to the April 1993 edition. APA Standard 87-1 contains procedures for construction and approval for
transportation of new fireworks and novelty items. In the revised standard, the shipping descriptions, hazard classes,
and section references are consistent with the current HMR. The revised standard also has been expanded to offer guidance
on conducting the fireworks stability test, and to address packaging requirements, EX-number markings, and transitional
provisions. 

The Association of American Railroads (AAR) petitioned (P-1193) to update ``AAR Manual of Standards and Recommended
Practices, Section C_Part III, Specification for Tank Cars, Specification M-1002,'' from the 1988 edition
to the September 1, 1992 edition. The revised AAR publication contains updated discussions of matters such as repair
of cracks, weld overlay, inspection of rubber-lined tank cars, and the renewal of approvals for valves and fittings.

The Compressed Gas Association (CGA) petitioned (P-1196) to update CGA Pamphlet C-7, entitled ``A Guide
for the Preparation of Precautionary Markings for Compressed Gas Containers, appendix A,'' from the April 15, 1983
edition to the 1992 (sixth) edition. In the 1992 edition, revisions have been made to the shipping descriptions for
consistency with the current HMR. 

The Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) petitioned (P-1171) to update IME Safety Library Publication 22
(IME Standard 22) entitled ``Recommendation for the Safe Transportation of Detonators in a Vehicle with Certain
Other Explosive Materials,'' from the January 1, 1985 edition to the May 1993 edition. This standard contains information
relative to the use and construction of IME-22 containers or compartments for the transport of certain detonators.
Section 173.63 authorizes the use of these containers and compartments for packaging detonators and  177.835(g)
authorizes the transportation of these packages on the same transport vehicle with other explosives. The IME standard
is used extensively by safety personnel in the commercial explosives industry for training purposes and by users
of explosives. In the revised standard, the shipping descriptions, hazard classes, and section references have
been revised for consistency with recent changes to the HMR.

 


RSPA has reviewed these updated standards. RSPA found no provisions that would impose additional requirements and
agrees that they should be incorporated by reference.

With regard to the AAR standards referenced in  171.7, the table contains separate entries for ``AAR Specification
for Tank Cars, Specification M-1002, 1988'' and ``AAR Specification for Tank Cars, Specification M-1002,
Section C_Part III, September 1988,'' which are the same standard. The first entry is removed, and the second entry
is revised to clarify that this standard is contained in the AAR Manual of Standards of Recommended Practices. These
changes were proposed under a separate rulemaking action [Docket HM-197; May 7, 1993; 58 FR 27257] and were supported
by commenters. They are merely finalized under this docket. 



Sections 172.101 and 172.102


IME and several explosives companies jointly petitioned (P-1143) to amend the Hazardous Materials Table (the
Table) in  172.101 to reinstate an entry for ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067.'' This shipping description
was one of six entries for ammonium nitrate fertilizers removed from the Table under a revised final rule issued December
20, 1991 [Docket HM-181; 56 FR 66124]. Although these descriptions are contained in the United Nations' Recommendations
on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UN Recommendations), they were removed because RSPA found them confusing and
difficult to use. However, petitioners assert that this shipping description, ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer,
UN2067,'' has been used widely for many years and the domestic industry has relied upon the ``Definition and Test Procedures
for Ammonium Nitrate Fertilizer,'' published by The Fertilizer Institute, to ensure the stability of their material.
Petitioners stated that their vehicle placards, shipping papers, and industry training procedures, including
emergency response training, rely on the identification number ``2067.'' They asserted that it would be a questionable
expenditure of time and money for them to convert their placards, documents and training procedures to show a different
identification number. RSPA agrees with the petitioners that adequate justification exists for reauthorizing
the description ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067.'' RSPA issued an approval (CA 93-10006) authorizing
use of the description ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, UN2067'' not meeting Class 1 (explosive) criteria. Therefore,
in this final rule, ``Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, 5.1, UN2067, III'' is added to the Table, subject to Special Provision
23. RSPA is also adding Special Provision 23 in  172.102(c)(1) stipulating that material shipped or transported
under this description may not meet Class 1 (explosive) criteria. 

Amalgamet Canada petitioned (P-1171) to amend the entry ``Titanium Tetrachloride'' in the Table by removing
Special Provision N41, which does not allow any packaging material to be made of metal construction. RSPA agrees that
removal of N41 would eliminate an inconsistency with Special Provisions B32 and T45, which allow the use of certain
containers made of stainless steel. 

RSPA is amending Special Provision B13 to extend the September 1, 1993 date for construction of cargo tanks that are
equivalent to MC 306 cargo tank specifications until August 31, 1995. This change is consistent with a final rule authorizing
the continued construction of MC 306 cargo tanks until August 31, 1995 [Docket HM-183, January 12, 1994; 59 FR
1784]. 



Section 173.34


Paragraph (e)(15)(i) was revised under Docket HM-166X [58 FR 50496; September 27, 1993] to allow DOT 3A and 3AA
cylinders over 35 years old to be retested every 10 years rather than every five years, provided they were manufactured
after December 31, 1945. However,  173.34(e)(15)(v) continues to allow only cylinders less then 35 years old
to be stamped with a five-point star showing that these cylinders may be tested every 10 years. Therefore, in this final
rule,  173.34(e)(15)(v) is revised, for consistency with paragraph (e)(15)(i), to permit cylinders manufactured
after December 31, 1945, to be stamped with a five-point star. Also, because cylinders manufactured on or before December
31, 1945, do not qualify for a ten-year retest period under these provisions, the wording of paragraph (e)(15)(i)
has been simplified. 

Paragraph (e)(17) requires DOT 8 and 8AL acetylene cylinders to be requalified, on a phase-in basis, in accordance
with CGA Pamphlet C-13. Because many acetylene cylinder owners voluntarily complied with CGA Pamphlet C-13
prior to issuance of the final rule, RSPA granted an exception, in paragraph (e)(17)(ii), for all cylinders requalified
and marked in accordance with the CGA pamphlet before January 15, 1993. The time required for RSPA to implement the
registration procedures for acetylene cylinder retesters resulted in a backlog of requests. To alleviate unnecessary
burdens to industry, RSPA has allowed retesters to continue requalifying and marking the cylinders in accordance
with CGA Pamphlet C-13. Accordingly, the date in paragraph (e)(17)(ii) is revised to reflect an extension to
October 1, 1994. 



Section 173.225



In paragraph (b), in Note 9 following the ``Organic Peroxides Table,'' the reference to `` 173.225(e)(3)(v)''
is corrected to read `` 173.225(e)(3)(ii).'' 



Section 173.247


In revisions to a final rule concerning the transport of elevated temperature materials [Docket HM-198A; 58
FR 3344; January 8, 1993], RSPA revised the bulk packaging requirements for the transport of asphalt by highway in
 173.247. In paragraph (g)(1)(iii)(B), to ensure that a reclosing pressure relief device is not rendered inoperable
by viscous lading, RSPA allowed an opening with a maximum three-inch nominal pipe diameter. The maximum effective
area of the opening was incorrectly given as 46 cm2 (7.1 in2). The correct maximum effective area is 48 cm2 (7.4 in2).
This final rule corrects this error. 



Sections 173.302 and 173.304


Sections 173.302(h) and 173.304(g) provide that mixtures meeting Division 2.3, Hazard Zone A, must conform to  173.40.
These provisions are revised to clarify that  173.40 applies to a pure gas, as well as a gas mixture, meeting Division
2.3, Hazard A. 



Section 173.306


In a final rule published on December 20, 1991 [Docket HM-181; 56 FR 66124], RSPA revised the limited quantity
provisions in  173.306(b)(3) to include Division 6.1 Packing Group III materials. Through an oversight, a
similar revision was not made to the aerosol provisions contained in paragraph (a)(3). Therefore, in this final rule,
RSPA is amending paragraph (a)(3) by adding the phrase ``(other than a Division 6.1 Packing Group III material).''

Section 173.420


In paragraph (a)(2)(i), the 1990 revision of ANSI N14.1 is added to the earlier editions of ANSI N14.1 cited in this
paragraph. Also, in paragraph (b), the reference to ANSI Standard N14.1-1987 is updated to 1990. These changes
are made for consistency with the incorporation by reference of the 1990 edition of this standard under this final
rule. 



Section 174.25


The example provided in paragraph (c) is revised by adding the wording ``PG II'' to reflect a complete basic description,
as stated in the sentence preceding the example. 



Section 178.503


The 17th Session of the UN Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods adopted amendments for incorporation
in the eighth revised edition of the UN Recommendations. One amendment provides that UN markings on certain steel
drums must include the thickness of the packaging material to the nearest tenth of a millimeter; however, the amendment
does not require the marking to contain a unit of measurement (i.e., ``mm''). Section 178.503(a)(9) states that the
marking must include the ``mm'' abbreviation for millimeters as part of the thickness marking for metal and plastic
drums and jerricans intended for reuse or reconditioning as single packagings or the outer packagings of composite
packagings. For consistency with the eighth revised edition of the UN Recommendations, paragraph (a)(9) is revised
to clarify that the marked thicknesses must be shown to the nearest tenth of a millimeter and to reflect that the ``mm''
abbreviation is not required. Recognizing that some manufacturers may choose to include the ``mm'' abbreviation
or may already be including the ``mm'' in drums markings, the provision allows marking of the ``mm'' symbol on a permissive
basis. Corresponding minor editorial changes are made to the UN marking examples shown in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)
and (d)(3). 



Section 178.505


In  178.505, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference
from `` 178.503(a)(10)'' to `` 178.503(a)(9).'' 



Section 178.506


In  178.506, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference
from `` 178.503(a)(10)'' to `` 178.503(a)(9).'' 



Section 178.509


In  178.509, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(4) by changing the reference
from `` 178.503(a)(10)'' to `` 178.503(a)(9).'' 



Section 178.511


In  178.511, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1) by changing the reference
from `` 178.503(a)(10)'' to `` 178.503(a)(9).'' 


Section 178.601


In  178.601, a typographical error is corrected in the first sentence of paragraph (g)(7) by changing the reference
from `` 178.601 (g)(1) and (g)(2)'' to `` 178.601 (g)(1) through (g)(6).''

Section 178.605



In  178.605, a typographical error is corrected in the last sentence of paragraph (b) by changing the reference
from the ``Associate Administrator of Hazardous Materials Safety'' to ``Associate Administrator for Hazardous
Materials Safety.'' 



Section 178.606



In  178.606, a typographical error is corrected in the third sentence of paragraph (b) by changing the reference
from the ``Associate Administrator of Hazardous Materials Safety'' to ``Associate Administrator for Hazardous
Materials Safety.'' 



Section 179.105-7



In  179.105-7, in paragraph (b), the reference to the 1976 edition of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars
is updated to reference the September 1, 1992 edition. 

This final rule will facilitate compliance with the HMR by correcting errors, clarifying provisions and updating
obsolete matter incorporated by reference. All of the changes are noncontroversial. With regard to matter incorporated
by reference, there is a need to update IME Standard 22 as quickly as possible to avoid misunderstandings that can adversely
affect the safe transportation of detonators. Other provisions of this rule provide minor relief from regulatory
provisions which will have an immediate benefit to the affected entities. For these reasons, RSPA has determined
that public notice and comment procedures, prior to adoption of this final rule, are not required under the Administrative
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.).





Regulatory Analyses and Notices 


A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and,
therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979).
The impacts of the changes are so minimal that a regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. 



B. Executive Order 12612 


This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612 (``Federalism'').
The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act contains express preemption provisions (49 App. U.S.C. 1811) that preempt
a non-Federal requirement if (1) compliance with both the non-Federal and the Federal requirement is not possible;
(2) the non-Federal requirement creates an obstacle to accomplishment of the Federal law or regulations; or (3) it
is preempted under 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4), concerning certain covered subjects, or 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(b), concerning
highway routing. Covered subjects are:




(i) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials; 
(ii) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials; 
(iii) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements
respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents; 
(iv) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
materials; or 

(v) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation
of hazardous materials.




49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(A) and (B).

 


This rule concerns the description and handling of hazardous materials. This rule preempts State, local, or Indian
tribe requirements in accordance with the standards set forth above. The HMTA (49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(5)) provides
that if DOT issues a regulation concerning any of the covered subjects after November 16, 1990, DOT must determine
and publish in the 

Federal Register

 the effective date of Federal preemption. That effective date may not be earlier than the 90th day following the date
of issuance of the final rule and not later than two years after the date of issuance. RSPA has determined that the effective
date of Federal preemption for the requirements in this rule concerning covered subjects is October 1, 1994. Thus,
RSPA lacks discretion in this area, and preparation of a federalism assessment is not warranted. 



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
This rule relaxes certain provisions that apply to hazardous materials shippers, carriers and packaging manufacturers,
some of whom are small entities. This final rule should result in minor cost savings to affected entities. It also reduces
confusion by incorporating by reference the latest editions of certain standards that have been revised for consistency
with the current HMR. 



D. Paperwork Reduction Act 


There are no new information collection requirements in this final rule. 


E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) 


A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified
Agenda.
