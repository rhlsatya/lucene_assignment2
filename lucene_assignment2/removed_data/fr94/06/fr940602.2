<DOCTITLE>Rocky Mountain Region; AA Production, Inc.; Twin-Creeks-Unit; Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests;
Gunnison County, Colorado; Notice</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on an AA Production, Inc., proposal to drill
4 coal bed methane wells on existing leases and construct a transportation system to these wells within the Clear Creek
Roadless Area on the Gunnison National Forest, Paonia Ranger District, approximately 23 miles north, northwest
of the town of Paonia, Colorado.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

AA Production, Inc. has submitted a proposal to drill 4 coal bed methane wells with foreseeable development of additional
wells if the first 4 are successful. Drilling would occur on existing leases granted before 1980 in the Clear Creek
Roadless area between Deadhorse Creek and Jones Park. The wells would be located within one mile of an existing road
(FDR 844) and a pipeline which parallels the road. The 4 proposed wells are more precisely located in the Southwest
Quarter of Section 21_Township 10 South_Range 90 West of the 6th Principal Meridian.




It is important to remain clear about the decisions to be made on the Twin-Creeks-Unit proposal. Decisions on whether
or not this area of the Forest will or will not be available for oil and gas leasing have already been made. AA Production,
Inc., holds valid oil & gas leases and have a legal right to drill on their leases. The 1993 Forest Oil & Gas Leasing
EIS has allocated the Clear Creek Roadless area to oil & gas development. These decisions will not be revisited,
unless an unavoidable effect on some very significant resource is discovered through this analysis. At this point,
we do not anticipate any effects such as this. We do have an obligation to consider all environmental factors, analyzed
to the latest standards, before we allow the proposed oil and gas development to occur so appropriate protection or
mitigation measures can be developed and implemented. This EIS will accomplish this.

The Forest Service will decide how, when, and exactly where, oil & gas development will occur while minimizing
effects on the human environment to the extent practical. The Forest Service has responsibility for managing surface
resources. Specifically, Forest Service decisions to be made are:




1. Determine specifically where, how, when, and under what conditions the transportation system and well pads will
be developed for the 4 wells proposed for drilling.

2. Determine general locations for the foreseeable wells, and any other mitigation needed in addition to those for
the first 4 proposed wells.

3. Determine if there are site specific unavoidable effects on very significant resources in the area which would
preclude drilling or surface occupancy.




Any well development other than the current proposal to drill 4 wells will require additional site specific environmental
analysis.

The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for deciding how actual down-hole drilling activities will occur and
has the authority to approve the Application For Permit To Drill (APD).

Preliminary scoping has identified nine issues. These issued are: (1) Visual Quality, (2) The proposed wells are
within a roadless area identified during the 1979 RARE II process, (3) Transportation System, Development, (4) Wildlife
Management and Protection including Threatened, Endangered, & Sensitive Wildlife & Plants, (5) Retention
of Water Quality, Wetlands, and Riparian areas, (6) Soils & Geologic Hazards, (7) Effects on Recreation Opportunities
& Outfitter Guides, (8) Social & Economic Effects, (9) Cultural & Historic Resources.

Scoping will consist of public meetings, news releases, and a scoping letter sent to people, organizations, and public
agencies who may be interested in this project. An open house is scheduled for June 9, 1994. A new release to local media
and interested parties is being made in conjunction with the June 9 meeting.

The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service will be consulted on possible effects on threatened and endangered plant and
animal species and may be asked to provide expertise for the environmental analysis. The Forest Service may consult
with other local, State, or Federal agencies as needed. The Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Geological Survey
will be asked to serve as Cooperating Agencies. The U.S. Geological Survey will serve as a coal-bed-methane well expert.
The Bureau of Land Management will serve as a drilling expert and is responsible for approving actual down-hole drilling
techniques. The U.S. Forest Service will be the Lead Agency.
The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection
Agency's notice of availability appears in the 

Federal Register

.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft environmental
impact statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement
may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel

, 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Circuit, 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris

, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day draft environmental impact statement comment period so that
substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider
them and respond to them in the final environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points. Please note that comments on the draft environmental
impact statement will be regarded as public information.
The responsible Bureau of Land Management official is Sally Wisley, Area Manager, San Juan Resource Area, Federal
Building, 701 Camino Del Rio, Durango, Colorado 81301.
The responsible Forest Service official is Ray L. Kingston, Paonia District Ranger, Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and
Gunnison National Forests, P.O. Box 1030, North Rio Grande Avenue, Paonia, Colorado 81428.

<DOCTITLE>Innovative Technologies to Accelerate Characterization, Treatment, Remediation, and Storage/Disposal of Mixed
Radioactive/Hazardous Waste at Federal Facilities </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Environmental Management, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of request for information (RFI). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) is soliciting information from private
companies regarding their capabilities to demonstrate new and innovative technologies that may accelerate or enhance
site activities in characterization, treatment, remediation, and storage/disposal of mixed radioactive/hazardous
wastes at federal facilities in the Western United States. This is not a solicitation for government proposals or
bids for procurement or financial assistance, but rather a request for information on new and innovative technologies
which may address characterization, treatment, and storage/disposal of mixed or hazardous waste. Based on information
received from this RFI, a formal RFP(s) may be issued focusing on specific needs and site characteristics. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The responses to the RFI will be reviewed by the Mixed Radioactive/Hazardous Waste Working Group of the Federal Advisory
Committee to Develop On-Site Innovative Technologies (DOIT Committee). The DOIT Committee consists of the Secretaries
of the U.S. Departments of Energy, Defense, and the Interior, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, and members of the Western Governor's Association (or their designees). The Federal Advisory Committee
will recommend a program to review information concerning technologies regarding environmental restoration/
waste management at DOE sites in western states; recommending demonstration projects for implementation; and identifying
regulatory, institutional, or other barriers to technology development. Pursuant to the Advisory Committee's
Charter, the initial lead agency is the Department of Energy, for which the Office of Technology Development serves
as the coordinating office. 


The Department of Energy has requested funding in its budget proposal for a project to conduct field demonstrations
of innovative technology involving mixed waste (characterization, treatment, and storage/disposal) beginning
in calendar year 1995. This program will implement the recommendations of the DOIT Committee. The goal will be to expedite
cleanup of federal sites by demonstrating environmental technologies which will address regulatory barriers and
public concerns throughout the technology demonstration project process. 
Factors that should be addressed in descriptions of cleanup technology are:

 

_Ability to alleviate risks to public health and safety and to the environment; 
_Capacity for public acceptance, permit and regulatory issues; 
_Extent of private sector and multi-agency involvement; 
_Potential for technology transfer or commercialization; 
_Likelihood of successful demonstration (technical risks, technology component and system); 
_Capacity for volume reduction of hazardous and radioactive components; 
_Viability of final waste forms and treated secondary waste forms which can gain public acceptance, be relatively
stable, and meet regulatory criteria; 
_Magnitude of recycling and material recovery potential; and 
_Ease of implementation to full scale initiative. 



Additionally, the following factors are considered to be important by the Mixed Radioactive/Hazardous Waste Working
Group of the Committee in its review of cleanup technologies: 



_The extent to which the technologies will ultimately remediate mixed waste at sites in one or more of the following
states and territories: Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, California, Colorado, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Northern Marianna Islands, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington,
and Wyoming; 
_The magnitude of the problem to which this technology can be applied (total volume, multiple sites, etc.); and 
_The extent to which the stakeholders will want to support DOE's development of the technology. 



Interested parties should submit a short paper not to exceed five (5) pages that will describe the technology and explain
why it will ultimately achieve the above mentioned objectives. If possible, papers should not include corporate
and proprietary information. Respondents are advised to clearly identify any and all proprietary data submitted
in response to this RFI, so that the Department is made aware of information which may need such protection. The duty
to identify proprietary information is not the responsibility of the Department of Energy. In addition, the Department
is under no obligation to pay for the expenses of submitting responses to the RFI. The dates on which the Working Group
will discuss specific concept papers will be published in advance in the 

Federal Register

. Those meetings will be open to the public.

Air Pollution Control; Ozone Transport Commission; Recommendation That EPA Adopt Low Emission Vehicle Program
for the Northeast Ozone Transport Region 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Round-Table Meetings. 



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On February 10, 1994, the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) submitted a recommendation to EPA under Section
184 of the Clean Air Act (the Act), for additional control measures to be applied throughout the Northeast Ozone Transport
Region (OTR). Specifically, the OTC recommended that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt an Ozone Transport
Commission Low Emission Vehicle (OTC LEV or LEV) program for the entire OTR. Under Section 184(c)(3) of the Act, EPA
is to review the OTC's recommendation to determine whether the additional control measures are necessary to bring
any area in the OTR into attainment by the dates specified in the Act, and are otherwise consistent with the Act. Based
on this review, EPA is obligated to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove the OTC's
recommendation. 



EPA recently issued a proposed rule describing the framework for EPA's action on the OTC's recommendation and describing
the issues EPA is considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove
the recommendation. Thereafter, EPA held public hearings on the OTC's recommendation in Hartford, Connecticut
on May 2-3, 1994. As previously announced, EPA will be holding a series of three public meetings in the OTR during
June and July, 1994 to provide an opportunity for interactive discussion of the issues involved. As discussed in greater
detail below, EPA is structuring these three public meetings to generally follow the framework for analysis it has
described in its proposal for action on the OTC's recommendation. 

At the first meeting, EPA expects the discussion to focus on the standard or test the Agency should apply in analyzing
the OTC's recommendation and the need for the Agency to act in a timely fashion based on the best available information.
Also at the first meeting, EPA expects the discussion to focus on issues related to the OTC LEV program, itself. At the
second meeting, the Agency intends to take up the policy, legal, and technical issues relating to the magnitude of
reductions needed, against which the OTC LEV program should be assessed. Also, at the second meeting EPA intends to
begin a discussion of alternative proposals for obtaining additional emissions reductions from new cars. EPA expects
this discussion may carry over into the third meeting. EPA also is reserving time at the third meeting to discuss new
issues that might arise in the course of the foregoing agenda that EPA does not foresee now, or issues that should be
revisited in light of later discussions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Organization of Public Meetings 


EPA intends that the three public meetings will allow for a fruitful exchange of information and views among the various
interested parties, the affected States, and EPA. The meetings will be organized as ``roundtable'' discussions.
In order to promote an interactive discussion, EPA has retained a facilitator to direct discussions among the various
parties. EPA will arrange for representatives of the various stake-holders, including the States, the auto manufacturers,
other industry, and environmental interest groups, to be seated at a table with EPA. The facilitator will direct discussion
first among these representatives. All members of the public are encouraged to attend and participate, and the public
will have an opportunity to comment on the discussion of each discrete topic on the agenda. 
EPA believes that an opportunity for public interactive discussions will provide a valuable opportunity for EPA
to refine and synthesize information from individual participants relevant to its action on the OTC's recommendation.
EPA is not, however, establishing the representatives invited to participate in the roundtable discussions as an
advisory committee, and EPA is not seeking a group opinion or recommendation from these representatives. 


II. Agendas for Discussion 


EPA's announcement of its receipt and availability of the OTC's recommendation provides a short background discussion
of the recommendation and its context, 59 FR 12914 (March 18, 1994). EPA's recent notice of proposed rulemaking, 59
FR 21720 (April 26, 1994), provides a detailed description of the framework for EPA's action on the recommendation
and the issues EPA is considering in reaching a decision. The reader should refer to these earlier notices for a full
understanding of the OTC's recommendation and the issues EPA is interested in pursuing at the public meetings. Additional
information may be obtained from the docket for this rulemaking (A-94-11), which includes a transcript
of the May 2-3 public hearing held on EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking. The description of the agendas for
the public meetings, below, presumes familiarity with these notices. 
To allow participants to focus their attention and prepare for topics on the agenda in advance, the Agency is disinclined
to substantially change these agendas. As the process advances, however, the Agency may make slight changes in light
of new issues that may emerge or to proceed quickly through issues that may require less time and attention than originally
scheduled. 


A. First Meeting; Philadelphia, PA on June 8, 1994 


At the first meeting, EPA intends the morning discussion to focus on the legal and policy aspects of the standard or
test the Agency should apply in analyzing the OTC's recommendation. The Agency believes this is an overarching issue
that should be addressed at the outset. Background for this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21725-27.

The agenda for the morning session is as follows: 


Interpretation of ``Necessity'' Finding


1. Relevance of standard under Section 211(c)(4)(C). 
2. Relevance of alternatives. 
3. Criteria for alternatives: standards for cost-effectiveness, practicability and reasonableness. 
4. Deference to the OTC and EPA's factual burden. 
5. The need for a timely decision based on available information despite scientific uncertainty. 
At the first meeting, EPA intends in the afternoon session to shift the discussion to focus on the recommended OTC LEV
program, itself. Background information for this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21722-23, 21730-31,
and 21734-36. EPA believes there are both important legal and policy, as well as technical aspects of the OTC
LEV program that merit discussion. Of course, the Agency has an obligation to evaluate whether the recommended program
is consistent with the Act. While many issues regarding the legality of an OTC LEV program have been the subject of litigation
and may be addressed adequately in written submissions, EPA believes that discussion of certain issues would be helpful.

The agenda for the afternoon session is as follows: 


OTC LEV 


1. Required elements of an OTC LEV program for purposes of consistency with Sections 177 and 209. 
2. Reductions from an OTC LEV program: what; where; when. 
3. Cost-effectiveness of an OTC LEV program. 
4. Assumptions about fuel used throughout the OTR, including attainment areas.

5. ZEV Component of OTC LEV 
 Is the ZEV sales mandate required to be part of the OTC LEV program? 
 Status of Electric Vehicle technology 
 Permutations on the ZEV Sales Mandate 
 Possible conditions or incentives for ZEVs (such as sales tax rebate or income tax credit). 
 Emissions impact of conditions or incentives for ZEVs in the absence of a sales mandate. 
 Consistency of conditions or incentives for ZEVs with Sections 177 and 209. 


B. Second Meeting; Durham, NH on June 23, 1994 


EPA intends the morning session to focus on the magnitude of reductions needed in assessing the OTC LEV program or alternatives.
The Agency believes the amount of reductions that additional control measures must achieve for attainment is a threshold
criterion for discussion. As noted in EPA's proposal, studies have consistently concluded that substantial reductions
in NO

x

 and VOC emissions are likely to be necessary to reduce ozone to the 0.12 ppm NAAQS or below throughout the OTR during
periods of adverse meteorological conditions. The best available information about the amount, location, timing,
and type of these reductions may be important in assessing the need for the OTC's recommended LEV program. EPA recognizes
the discussions regarding the magnitude of reductions needed involves legal, policy and technical aspects that
are in many ways interrelated. EPA expects that all of these aspects will be addressed in the discussion of these issues.
Background information for the legal and policy aspects of this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21727-30.
Background information for the technical aspects of this topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21730-31.

Also in the morning session, the Agency intends to provide an opportunity for discussion of whether alternative control
measures are available to obtain sufficient emissions reductions so that more stringent emissions standards for
new cars would not be necessary. This information could be relevant to the need for the OTC LEV program or a program to
obtain similar reductions from new cars. As discussed in EPA's proposal, other measures may qualify as ``alternatives''
to LEV only if the other measures, singly or in combination, generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall
needed without LEV. Background information for the alternatives topic can be found in EPA's proposal, 59 FR at 21733-34.

The agenda for the morning session is as follows: 


Magnitude of Reductions 


1. Location of needed reductions; relevance of contribution to downwind nonattainment, including discussion
of requirements for attainment demonstration and relevance of boundary conditions. 
2. Best current information regarding the OTR's needs for attainment, including timing of reductions for
moderate, serious, and severe areas. 
3. Need for reductions for maintenance. 
4. Magnitude of motor vehicle emissions in the overall inventory. 
5. Confidence in current technical tools and information. 


Sufficiency of Alternatives that Might Render OTC LEV Unnecessary, Including Magnitude of Reductions Available,
Cost, Practicability, and Reasonableness 


In the afternoon session, EPA intends to begin discussion of alternative programs designed to reduce emissions from
new motor vehicles. EPA recognizes that such alternatives designed to reduce emissions from new motor vehicles could
conceivably constitute an ``alternative'' to OTC LEV. Such alternatives that obtain reductions from the same sources
as the OTC LEV program would thus be, at least in part, redundant of the reductions that the OTC LEV program would generate.
(If entirely redundant of OTC LEV reductions, the sufficiency of such an alternative to fill the entire shortfall
might arguably not be important.) EPA intends to begin discussion of such motor vehicle alternatives in the afternoon
session.

As a threshold matter, EPA notes that its responsibility under Section 184 of the Act is to approve or disapprove the
OTC's LEV recommendation, and that Section 184 does not appear to authorize EPA to mandate alternatives. Nevertheless,
EPA believes that the emergence of another approach to obtaining emissions reductions from new vehicles might conceivably
affect the need for the OTC LEV program. 

EPA believes that threshold issues regarding such alternatives include how they might affect EPA's obligations
regarding the OTC's recommendation now before EPA, and their legal consistency with Sections 177 and 209 of the Act.
Thereafter, EPA expects that the discussion would turn to the specifics of the alternative proposals, which will
carry over into the third meeting. 

The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) has presented one such alternative. Under EDF's approach, the auto manufacturers
would be responsible for achieving reductions commensurate with those that the OTC LEV program would achieve, and
could do so by selling cars meeting LEV standards or by trading emissions reduction credits among themselves or with
stationary sources. EPA expects to begin discussion of this alternative in the afternoon session. EPA recognizes
that it may be ambitious to cover this entire topic at the second meeting, and may have to resume discussion of it at the
third meeting. Further information pertaining to EDF's proposal is available in EDF's comments and testimony in
the public docket. 

The agenda for the afternoon session is as follows: 



Relevance of New Motor Vehicle Standards Alternatives to EPA's Obligation to Approve or Disapprove the OTC LEV Recommendation



1. Should EPA disapprove the OTC LEV recommendation based on proposals to change that program or on different, more
stringent new motor vehicle standards (e.g. The EDF proposal or the auto manufacturers proposal, discussed below)?


2. Must there be a mechanism for EPA to be assured that the States will adopt the different approach, and if so what would
that mechanism be? 



EDF Trading Proposal 



1. Mechanism for implementation. 

2. Extent of trading: among auto companies; with stationary sources; across State boundaries. 

3. Baseline for assessing whether reductions are surplus and can be traded to avoid otherwise applicable emissions
reduction obligations. 

4. Constraints on trading to ensure that areas reduce emissions that contribute to nonattainment downwind. 

5. Need for discounting credits. 

6. Role of ZEVs in a trading scheme. 

7. Consistency with Sections 177 and 209. 



C. Third Meeting; New York, NY on July 13, 1994 



EPA intends to dedicate the third meeting to continued discussion of other proposals for obtaining additional emissions
reductions from new motor vehicles or other sources. EPA intends to first complete any remaining carryover discussion
of the EDF proposal from the second meeting. EPA intends to then continue with a discussion of the auto manufacturers'
proposed alternative known as the Federal LEV or FLEV program. EPA's proposal describes this alternative, 59 FR at
21732-33. 

Also in the morning session, the Agency intends to provide an opportunity for discussion of the proposal presented
at EPA's May 2-3 public hearing by Texaco, Inc., Public Service Electric and Gas (PSE&G), and Merck &
Company, Inc. Further information regarding this proposal is available in comments and testimony from these companies
in the public docket. 

EPA expects that time will be left at the end of the third meeting to address previously unidentified topics, alternatives
or issues that were not raised earlier. In addition, EPA expects that issues addressed in the earlier meetings might
be revisited at this time in light of later discussions. 

The agenda for the third meeting is as follows: 



FLEV Proposal 



1. Enforceability. 

2. SIP creditability. 

3. Consistency with Sections 177 and 209. 

4. Emissions reductions, and comparison with LEV emissions reductions, including timing. 

5. EPA's authority to disapprove the OTC LEV recommendation based on an alternative that States apparently could
not adopt in their SIPs or otherwise into State law. 



NOx Cap Proposal from Texaco, PSE&G, and Merck

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Settlement; Request for Public Comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act (``Act''), notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement of


Alabama Power Company, et al., 

v. 

United States Environmental Protection Agency, 

No. 93-1611 (D.C. Cir.), and a proposed partial settlement of 

Environmental Defense Fund

 v. 

Carol M. Browner, et al., 

No. 93-1203 (and consolidated cases) (D.C. Cir.).



The first case involves a challenge to a statement set forth by EPA in the preamble of a proposed EPA action published
in the 

Federal Register

 on July 16, 1933, entitled ``Acid Rain Program: Notice of Draft Permits and Public Comment Period.'' 58 FR 38370 (July
16, 1993).

The second case involves challenges by several parties to the acid rain core rules published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 11, 1993, at 58 FR 3590 (January 11, 1993). The proposed settlement related principally to the substitution
and reduced utilization provisions of the January 11, 1993 rules.

For a period of thirty (30) days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments
relating to the settlements from persons who were not named as parties to the litigation in question. EPA or the Department
of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed settlement if the comments disclose facts or circumstances
that indicate that such consent is inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements
of the Act. Copies of the settlement are available from Phyllis Cochran, Air and Radiation Division (2344), Office
of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260-7606.

<DOCTITLE>Hawaii: Final Determination of Adequacy of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final determination of full program adequacy for Hawaii's application. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(B), requires States to develop and implement permit programs
to ensure that municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity
generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). Section 4005(c)(1)(C)
of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States
have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs. 



Approved State permit programs provide interaction between the State and MSWLFs owners and operators regarding
site-specific permit conditions. Only owners or operators located in States with approved permit programs can use
the site-specific flexibility provided by 40 CFR part 258 to the extent the State permit program allows such flexibility.
EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State and the permit status of any facility, the Federal MSWLF
criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 

Hawaii applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Hawaii's application and
issued for public comment a tentative determination that Hawaii's permit program is adequate to assure compliance
with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Based on a thorough review of Hawaii's MSWLF program and the fact that no comments
were received from the public, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Hawaii's MSWLF program is adequate.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

A. Background 



On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6941-6949(a),
as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs
to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under part 258. Section 4005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945, also requires
that EPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal
Criteria. To facilitate this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State and Tribe
Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State and
Tribal landfill permit programs. 

EPA intends to approve State MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of
the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. EPA interprets
the statutory requirements for States to develop ``adequate'' permit programs to impose several minimum standards.
First, each State must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to
EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval
to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State must also provide for public participation in permit
issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974. Finally, the State must show that
it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or
operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 

EPA Regions will determine whether a State has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA expects States to meet all of the criteria for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval
to a MSWLF program. In addition, States may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. 

On October 8, 1993, Hawaii submitted an application for adequacy determination for Hawaii's MSWLF permit program.
On March 7, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Hawaii's MSWLF program.
Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 10644 (March 7, 1994). 

Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. EPA
received neither comments nor a request for a public meeting on this determination. 

The State of Hawaii has the authority to enforce the requirements of its MSWLF program at all MSWLFs in the State. 



B. Decision 



In the tentative determination, EPA proposed to fully approve Hawaii's MSWLF program. Hawaii's application for
adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly,
Hawaii is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of its MSWLF permit program.

Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the Federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State enforcement program. As EPA explained in the
preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State program
approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October
9, 1991). 

Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's MSWLF program are already in effect as a matter of State law.
EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements that the regulated community must begin to comply with. Nor
do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give
notice prior to making its approval effective. 



Compliance With Executive Order 12866 



The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866. 



Certification Under The Regulatory Flexibility Act 




Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 






Authority: 

This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005 and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6949a(c).

 Extension of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR part 258). 

On April 7, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16647) a notice of tentative determination on application of the State of South Dakota for Program Adequacy
Determination Over Non-Indian Lands for the Former Lands of the Yankton Sioux, Lake Traverse (Sisseton-Wahpeton)
and parts of the Rosebud Indian Reservations. In order to provide additional opportunity for all interested parties
to review and comment on this proposed action, EPA is extending the public comment period beyond the original June
2, 1994, date provided for in the April 7, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice to July 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Delegations of Authority With Respect to Undercapitalized Institutions</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FDIC has delegated limited authority to its Executive Director for Supervision and Resolutions and/or its Director,
Division of Supervision (DOS), to determine that action other than appointing a receiver would better achieve the
statutory purpose of minimizing long-term loss to the deposit insurance fund from resolving the problems of insured
depository institutions and to make certain other determinations relating to prompt corrective action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background



Effective December 19, 1992, section 38(h)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o(h)(3)) mandates
appointment of a receiver not later than 90 days after an institution becomes critically undercapitalized unless
the appropriate regulator, with FDIC concurrence, determines that an alternative course of action ``would better
achieve the purpose of [section 38 to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions at the least possible
long-term loss to the deposit insurance fund]''. Such a determination is valid for up to 90 days and may be reinstated
for additional periods of up to 90 days by new determinations properly documented. After one year a receiver must be
appointed unless the head of the appropriate regulatory agency and the Chairperson of the FDIC certify that ``the
institution is viable and not expected to fail'' and the institution also meets four other specific criteria.

Section 38 also permits the appropriate federal banking agency of an undercapitalized institution to determine
not to take certain otherwise mandated corrective actions under subsection (f) if to do so would not further the purpose
of section 38.



II. Delegation of Authority



A. Deferring Appointment of Receiver



In connection with the resolution of critically undercapitalized institutions, there are certain cases where it
is appropriate to extend the 90-day receivership deadline, such as where the chartering authority or appropriate
federal banking agency sets a resolution date beyond the deadline in order to accommodate the information gathering
needs required to facilitate an orderly resolution. Another example might be an institution with a promising recapitalization
in progress which will not be fully effected prior to the deadline but has a good chance of being successful. It is appropriate
that such matters be acted on at the staff level, under delegated authority, with respect to the first determination
to defer the appointment of a receiver for up to 90 days for a particular institution. Accordingly, the Board has delegated
authority to the Executive Director for Supervision and Resolutions, the Director, DOS, and where confirmed in writing
by the Director, to an associate director, to make determinations under section 38(h)(3)(A)(ii) with respect to
institutions for which the FDIC is the appropriate federal banking agency, and to affirmatively concur with actions
thereunder by other appropriate federal banking agencies, as to any action in lieu of appointing a receiver for a critically
undercapitalized institution.

<TEXT>
 

This delegated authority does not extend to actually appointing a conservator or a receiver under section 38(h)(3)(A)(i),
or to concurring therein, and also does not include authority to grant or concur in more than one deferral per institution
or to withhold FDIC concurrence with respect to any action taken under section 38(h)(3)(A) by an appropriate federal
banking agency in lieu of appointing a receiver. Each action under delegated authority will be documented in writing,
setting forth how deferring the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the initial 90-day period will minimize
long-term loss to the deposit insurance fund.



B. Waiver of Certain Corrective Actions



Section 38(f) requires that at least the following three types of specific action be taken against critically and
significantly undercapitalized institutions, as well as against undercapitalized institutions which have failed
to submit and implement an acceptable capital restoration plan, unless the agency determines that the actions would
not further the purpose of section 38: (1) Requiring the sale of securities or consolidation with another institution;
(2) requiring compliance with section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act without benefit of the exemption therein for
transactions with certain affiliated institutions; and (3) restricting the interest rates paid on deposits to prevailing
rates. Where, for example, a near-term resolution or recapitalization of an institution is anticipated, the pursuit
of such formal actions against an institution would not normally minimize loss to the insurance fund. In those and
other cases, making such determinations would be appropriately delegable to staff. Accordingly, the Board has delegated
such authority under section 38(f)(3) to the Executive Director for Supervision and Resolutions, the Director,
DOS, or an associate director designated in writing by such Director. Each such action under delegated authority
must be documented in writing, clearly setting forth the reasons therefor.




By order of the Board of Directors.




Dated at Washington, DC, this 24th day of May 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Amendment to an Existing System of Records </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of amendment to an existing system of records_``Confidential Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System''
(formerly ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System''). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As part of an ongoing examination of the FDIC's systems of records, the ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement
System'' has been reviewed for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Numerous minor amendments have
been made that will clarify and/or more accurately describe the following categories in this system of records: System
name, system location, categories of individuals covered by the system, categories of records in the system, authority
for maintenance of the system, retrievability, and retention and disposal. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The FDIC's system of records entitled ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' is being amended to clarify
and/or more accurately describe its contents. These modifications include changing the system name to the ``Confidential
Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System,'' updating titles of existing forms and sources of authority,
and rewording descriptions of the contents of existing forms. Additionally, the description of individuals covered
by the system specifically includes prospective employees in order to extend system coverage to those individuals
under consideration for positions identified in 5 CFR 2634.904 who are required to file a Confidential Financial
Disclosure Report as authorized by 5 CFR 2634.903(b)(3). This refinement has been coordinated with and approved
by the Office of Government Ethics. Finally, the description of retention and disposal procedures is expanded to
delineate the retention and disposal procedures for the records of prospective employees who are not selected for
employment and to clarify that disposal of information in automated computer files is by deletion. 


Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the FDIC amends the ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' to
read as follows:

(2) Any weight loss is maintained long-term, said evidence shall, at a minimum, be based upon the experience of participants
who were followed for a period of at least two years from their completion of the active maintenance of respondent's
program or earlier termination, as applicable; and

(3) Any weight loss is maintained permanently, said evidence shall, at a minimum, be based upon the experience of participants

that weight loss will be permanent, or

(b) Demonstrated by competent and reliable survey evidence as being of sufficient duration to permit such a prediction.

I.E. herein, that participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless respondent
discloses, clearly and prominently, and in close proximity to such representation, the statement: ``For many dieters,
weight loss is temporary.''; provided further, that respondent shall not represent, directly or by implication,
that the above-quoted statement does not apply to dieters in respondent's weight loss program, provided, however,
that a mere statement about the existence, design, or content of a maintenance program shall not, without more, be
considered a representation that participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss.

I.D. herein, and except through endorsements or testimonials referred to in paragraph I.E. herein, that participants
of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless respondent discloses, clearly and prominently,
and in close proximity to such representation, the following information:

(1) The average percentage of weight loss maintained by those participants;

(2) The duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that participants ended the active
weight loss phase of the program, provided, further, that if any portion of the time period covered includes participation
in a maintenance program(s) that follows active weight loss, such fact must also be disclosed; and

(3) If the participant population referred to is not representative of the general participant population for respondent's
programs:

(a) The proportion of the total participant population in respondent's programs that those participants represent,
expressed in terms of a percentage or actual numbers of participants, or

(b) The statement: ``Beverly Hills makes no claim that this [these] result[s] is [are] representative of all participants
in the Beverly Hills program.'';

Provided, further, that compliance with the obligations of this paragraph I.C. in no way relieves respondent of the
requirement under paragraph I.A. of this Order to substantiate any representation about the success of participants
on any weight loss program in maintaining weight loss.

D. Representing, directly or by implication, in short broadcast advertisements, that participants of any weight
loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless respondent:

(1) Includes, clearly and prominently, and in immediate conjunction with such representation, the statement: ``Check
at our clinics for details about our maintenance record.'';

(2) For a period of time beginning with the date of the first broadcast of any such advertisement and ending no sooner
than thirty days after the last broadcast of such advertisement, complies with the following procedures upon the
first presentation of any form asking for information from a potential client, but in any event before such person

(b) require each potential client to sign such document; and
(c) give each client a copy of such document; and
Provided, however, that if any potential participant who does not then participate in the program refuses to sign
or accept a copy of such document, respondent shall so indicate on such document and shall not, for that reason alone,
be found in breach of this subparagraph I.D.(2); and
(3) retain in each client file a copy of the signed maintenance notice required by this paragraph;
Provided, further, that:
(i) Compliance with the obligations of this paragraph I.D. in no way relieves respondent of the requirement under
paragraph I.A. of this Order to substantiate any representation about the success of participants on any weight loss
program in maintaining weight loss; and
(ii) respondent must comply with both paragraph I.D. and paragraph I.C. of this Order if respondent includes in any
such short broadcast advertisement a representation about maintenance success that states a number or percentage,

E. Using any advertisement containing an endorsement or testimonial about weight loss success or weight loss maintenance

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Beverly Hills Weight Loss
Clinics International, Inc., (hereinafter ``Beverly Hills''), marketer of the Beverly Hills low-calorie diet
(hereinafter ``LCD'') program. The Beverly Hills diet program is offered to the public in the eastern United States
through company-owned and franchised clinics.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for the reception of comments by
interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)
days, the Commission will again review the agreement and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.

The Commission's complaint charges that the proposed respondent deceptively advertised: (1) Its LCD program's
success in helping customers achieve and maintain weight loss; (2) the typical rate or speed at which customers will
lose weight; (3) the time frame within which customers will achieve their desired weight loss goal; (4) the safety
of the Beverly Hills program in comparison to other weight loss programs; (5) the purchase price of the Beverly Hills
program; and (6) the terms of the company's offers of free weight loss services. The complaint further alleges that
Beverly Hills engaged in the deceptive practice of failing to warn clients it monitors of the health importance of
following the diet instructions.



Success



The complaint against Beverly Hills alleges that the company failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims it made
regarding the success of its customers in losing weight and avoiding the regain of weight lost during the program.
Through consumer testimonials and other advertisements, Beverly Hills represented that its customers typically
are successful in reaching their weight loss goals and in maintaining their weight loss achieved under the Beverly
Hills diet program either long-term or permanently.

The Commission believes that these success claims for customer weight loss and maintenance of achieved weight loss
are deceptive because at the time it made the claims Beverly Hills did not possess adequate substantiation for those
claims.

The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged success misrepresentations cited in the accompanying complaint
in several ways. First, the order (part I.A.) requires the company to possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent
and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim about the success of participants on any diet program
in achieving or maintaining weight loss. To ensure compliance, the order further specifies what this level of evidence
shall consist of when certain types of success claims are made:

(1) In the case of claims that weight loss is typical or representative of all participants using the program or any
subset of those participants, that evidence shall be based on a representative sample of: (a) All participants who
have entered the program, where the representation relates to such persons; or (b) all participants who have completed
a particular phase of the program or the entire program, where the representation only relates to such persons.

(2) In the case of claims that any weight loss is maintained long-term, that evidence shall be based upon the evidence
of participants who were followed for a period of at least two years after their completion of the respondent's program,
including any periods of participation in respondent's maintenance program.

(3) In the case of claims that weight loss is maintained permanently, that evidence shall be based upon the experience
of participants who were followed for a period of time after completing the program that is either: (a) Generally recognized
by experts in the field of treating obesity as being of sufficient length to constitute a reasonable basis for predicting
that weight loss will be permanent; or (b) demonstrated by competent and reliable survey evidence as being of sufficient
duration to permit such a prediction.

Second, as measures to ensure future compliance, the proposed order requires the proposed respondent for any claim
that participants of any diet program have successfully maintained weight loss to disclose the fact that ``For many
dieters, weight loss is temporary'' (part I.B.), as well as the following information relating to that claim (part
I.C.):

(1)The average percentage of weight loss maintained by those participants (

e.g.

, ``60% of achieved weight loss was maintained''),

(2) the duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that participants ended the active
weight loss phase of the program, and the fact that all or a portion of the time period covered includes participation
in proposed respondent's maintenance program(s) that follows active weight loss, if that is the case_

e.g.

, ``participants maintain an average of 60% of weight loss 22 months after active weight loss (includes 18 months on
maintenance program)'', and

(3) where the participant population referred to is not representative of the general participant population for
that program, the proportion of the total participant population that those participants represent, expressed
in terms of a percentage or actual numbers of participants_

e.g.

 ``Participants on maintenance_30% of our clients_kept off an average of 66% of the weight for one year (includes time
on maintenance program)'' or, in lieu of that factual disclosure, the statement: ``Beverly Hills makes no claim that
this result is representative of all participants in the Beverly Hills program.''

Third, for maintenance success claims made in broadcast advertisements of thirty seconds or less duration, the proposed
order (part I.D.) requires that Beverly Hills, in lieu of making the factual disclosures required for such claims
by Part I.C: (1) Include in such advertisements the statement ``Check at our centers for details about our maintenance
record.''; and (2) provide consumers at point-of-sale with a required form that includes the factual disclosures
required by Part I.C., which form must be signed by the client and retained in the company's client file.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940602-2-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed order makes clear that this alternative disclosure requirement does not relieve Beverly Hills of the
obligation to substantiate any maintenance success claim, in accordance with part I.A. of the order, and it ``takes
back'' the exception from full quantitative disclosures in short broadcast advertising if Beverly Hills makes a
maintenance success claim that uses numbers or descriptive terms that convey a quantitative measure, such as ``most
of our customers maintain their weight loss long term.'' Beverly Hills in that case would have to make all the required
disclosures in the ad and provide the disclosures at point-of-sale.

Fourth, for weight-loss and weight-loss maintenance success claims made through endorsements or testimonials
that are not representative of what Beverly Hills idet program participants generally achieve, the order (part I.E.)
requires that Beverly Hills disclosure either what the generally expected success would be for Beverly Hills customers,
or one of several alternative statements, such as ``This result is not typical. You may be less successful'', which
explains the limited applicability of atypical testimonials in accordance with the Commission's ``Guides Concerning
Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising'' 16 CFR 255.2(a). Under the proposed order, Beverly Hills may
satisfy the requirements of the first disclosure concerning generally expected success by accurately disclosing
those facts in the following format: ``Beverly Hills clients lose an average of 

XX

 pounds over an average 

XX

-week treatment period.''

Finally, the proposed order (part I.P.) generally prohibits the company from misrepresenting the performance or
efficacy of any weight loss program.



Rate of Weight Loss



The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for claims it
made concerning the average rate of weight loss for participants in its program. The proposed consent order addresses
this practice (part I.J.) by prohibiting Beverly Hills from representing that participants in its programs will
lose weight at an average or typical rate or speed, unless Beverly Hills possesses and relies upon competent and reliable
scientific evidence substantiating the representation.



Projection of Weight Loss



The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for its claim
made during initial sales presentations that consumers will typically reach their desired weight-loss goal within
the time frame computed by Beverly Hills personnel. To address this practice, the proposed order (part I.K.) prohibits
Beverly Hills from representing that participants or prospective participants will reach a specified weight within
a specified period of time, unless proposed respondent possesses and relies upon competent and reliable scientific
evidence substantiating the representation.



Comparative Safety Claim



The Commission's complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to possess a reasonable basis for its claim
that its weight loss programs are safer than other weight loss programs that do not include essential fatty acid supplementation.
The proposed order seeks to address this practice in two ways. First, part I.M. requires the company to have competent
and reliable scientific evidence substantiating any claim that compares the safety of its weight loss program with
that of any other weight loss or diet program. Second, part I.P. of the proposed order prohibits the company from misrepresenting,
among other things, the safety of any weight loss program or weight loss product.



Monitoring Practices



According to the complaint, Beverly Hills provides its customers with diet instructions that require the customers
to come in to one of the proposed respondent's centers three times a week for monitoring of their progress, including
weighing in. In the course of regularly ascertaining weight loss progress, respondent, in some instances, is presenting
with weight loss results indicating that customers are losing weight significantly in excess of their projected
goals, which is an indication that they may not be consuming all of the food prescribed by their diet instructions.
According to the complaint, such conduct could, if not corrected promptly, result in health complications. In light
of this monitoring practice, the Commission's complaint alleges that Beverly Hills has failed to disclose to consumers
who are losing weight significantly in excess of their projected goals that failing to follow the diet instructions
and consume all of the food prescribed could result in health complications.

The proposed consent order seeks to address the alleged monitoring misrepresentation cited in the accompanying
complaint in two ways. First, the order (part I.N.) requires Beverly Hills to disclose in writing to all participants
when they enter the program, that failure to follow the program instructions and eat all of the food recommended may
involve the risk of developing serious health complications. Second, the proposed order (part I.P.) generally prohibits
any misrepresentation concerning the safety of any weight loss program.

Price 


The Commission's complaint against Beverly Hills also alleges that the company falsely represented that the price
it advertised far its diet program is the only cost associated with losing weight on the diet program, when, in fact,
there are substantial additional mandatory expenses that far exceed the advertised price. The complaint further
alleges that Beverly Hills failed to disclose adequately to consumers the existence and amount of all mandatory expenses
associated with participation in the diet program. 
The proposed consent order seeks to address these practices in three ways. First, part I.F. of the proposed order prohibits
untrue representations that an advertised price for a weight loss program is the only cost associated with losing
weight on that program. Second, for any advertisement containing a price at which any weight loss program can be purchased,
the proposed order (part I.G.) requires Beverly Hills to disclose either the existence and amount of all mandatory
costs or fees associated with the program offered or a statement identifying a list of all products or services that
participants must purchase at an additional cost. This disclosure must be made orally under the proposed order if
the price representation is made orally under the proposed order if the free offer is made orally in broadcast media.
Finally, the proposed order (part I.I.) requires the proposed respondent to disclose over the telephone to callers
who inquire or are told about the cost of any weight loss program, the existence and amount of any mandatory costs or
fees associated with participation in the program. Under the order, Beverly Hills can satisfy this requirement by:
(1) Providing the center personnel with suggested language to be used when responding to telephone inquiries; and
(2) making its best efforts to ensure compliance with its directive to disclose price information over the telephone.



Fee Offers 


The Commission's complaint also alleges that, through offers of free weight loss services, Beverly Hills falsely
represented that its weight loss programs were being offered to consumers at no cost. The complaint further alleges
that the company failed to disclose adequately to consumers that the receipt of free weight loss services is contingent
upon the purchase, at substantial expense to the consumer, of other goods or services that are mandatory for participation
in the company's weight loss programs. 
The proposed consent order (part I.H.) seeks to address this practice by requiring that the company disclose either
(1) the existence and amount of all mandatory fees associated with the free offer, or (2) a list of all products or services
that participants must purchase at an additional cost to take advantage of the free offer. This disclosure must be
made orally under the proposed order if the free offer is made orally in broadcast media. 
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.

I.





It is ordered that respondents QWLC-Ga., a corporation, its successors and assigns, and its officers, and Don
K. Gearheart, individually and as an officer of said corporation, and respondents' agents, representatives, and
employees, directly or through any corporation, subsidiary, division, or other device, in connection with the advertising,
promotion, offering for sale, or sale of any weight loss program, in or affecting commerce, as ``commerce'' is defined
in the Federal Trade Commission Act, do forthwith cease and desist from:



A. Making any representation, directly or by implication, about the success of participants on any weight loss program
in achieving or maintaining weight loss or weight control unless, at the time of making any such representation, respondents
possess and rely upon competent and reliable scientific evidence substantiating the representation, provided,
further, that for any representation that:



(1) Any weight loss achieved or maintained through the weight loss program is typical or representative of all or any
subset of participants of respondents' program, said evidence shall, at a minimum, be based on a representative sample
of:



(a) All participants who have entered the program, where the representation relates to such persons; provided, however,
that the required sample may exclude those participants who dropped out of the program within two weeks of their entrance,
or who were unable to complete the program due to illness, pregnancy, or change of residence; or 



(b) All participants who have completed a particular phase of the program or the entire program, where the representation
only relates to such persons;



(2) Any weight loss is maintained long-term, said evidence shall, at a minimum, be based upon the experience of participants
who were followed for a period of at least two years from their completion of the active maintenance phase of respondents'
program or earlier termination, as applicable; and



(3) Any weight loss is maintained permanently, said evidence shall, at a minimum, be based upon the experience of participants
who were followed for a period of time after completing the program that is either:



(a) Generally recognized by experts in the field of treating obesity as being of sufficient length for predicting

I.E. herein, that participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless respondents
disclose, clearly and prominently, and in close proximity to such representation, the statement: ``For many dieters,
weight loss is temporary''; provided, further, that respondents shall not represent, directly or by implication,
that the above-quoted statement does not apply to dieters in respondents' weight loss program; provided, however,
that a mere statement about the existence, design, or content of a maintenance program shall not, without more, be
considered a representation that participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss.



C. Representing, directly or by implication, except through short broadcast advertisements referred to in paragraph
I.D. herein, and except through endorsements or testimonials referred to in paragraph I.E. herein, that participants
on any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless respondents disclose, clearly and prominently,

(1) The average percentage of weight loss maintained by those participants;



(2) The duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that participants ended the active
weight loss phase of the program, provided, further, that if any portion of the time period covered includes participation
in a maintenance program(s) that follows active weight loss, such fact must also be disclosed; and

programs:



(a) The proportion of the total participant population in respondent's programs that those participants represent,
expressed in terms of a percentage or actual numbers of participants, or



(b) The statement: ``[Quick Weight Loss Centers] makes no claim that this [these] result[s] is [are] representative

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted for comment three separate proposed consent orders with the following:
(1) Doctors Medical Weight Loss Centers, Inc. (``DMWLC''), Doctors Weight Loss Centers, Inc. (``DWLC''), and Joyce
A. Schuman (``Schuman''); (2) Quick Weight Loss Centers, Inc., a Georgia corporation (``QWLC-Ga.''), and
Don K. Gearheart (``Gearheart''); and (3) Quick Weight Loss Centers, Inc., a Texas corporation (``QWLC-Tex.''),
Gearheart, and Schuman. Under the direction and control of Gearheart and Schuman, the companies marketed similar
low-calorie diet programs through weight loss centers in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, and used substantially similar
advertisements and promotional materials to do so.

The Commission has placed the proposed orders on the public record for sixty days for comment by interested persons.
Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty days, the Commission will
again review the three agreements and decide whether it should withdraw from, or make final, any or all of the proposed
orders.

The Commission's three complaints charge that all of the proposed respondents deceptively promoted the efficacy
and price of their diet programs, the rate at which their customers lose weight, and used deceptive monitoring practices.
The complaint against QWLC-Tex., Gearheart, and Schuman also charges that they deceptively promoted the qualifications
of, and supervision offered by, their staff.



Efficacy



The Commission's three complaints first charge that all of the proposed respondents failed to substantiate claims
that their customers typically are successful in reaching and maintaining their goal weight.

The agreed-to orders seek to address these charges in several ways. First, the proposed orders simply prohibit representations
about the success of customers in achieving or maintaining weight loss, unless proposed respondents have and rely
upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the representations. ( I.A.) For representations
that any weight loss achieved or maintained through weight loss programs is typical or representative of all, or any
subset, of customers, the required ``competent and reliable scientific evidence'' must be based upon a sample of
(1) all customers who entered the diet programs, where the representation relates to such customers, or (2) all customers
who completed a particular phase of a diet program, or the entire program, where the representation relates only to
such customers. ( I.A. (1)) for representations that any weight loss is maintained long-term, the supporting
evidence must be based upon the experience of customers who were followed for at least two years after they completed
the maintenance phase of the diet programs (or earlier termination, as applicable). ( I.A. (2)) For representations
that any weight loss is maintained permanently, the required evidence must be based upon the experience of customers
who were followed for a period of time that is either (1) generally recognized by experts in the field of treating obesity
as being of sufficient length to predict that weight loss will be maintained permanently, or (2) demonstrated by competent
and reliable survey evidence as being of sufficient length to permit such a prediction. ( I.A. (3))

The proposed orders also prohibit proposed respondents from representing that customers of any weight loss program
have successfully maintained weight loss, unless they also disclose that ``for many dieters, weight loss is temporary''
( I.B), as well as the following factual information: (1) The average percentage of weight loss maintained
by those customers; (2) the duration over which the weight loss was maintained, measured from the date that customers
ended the active weight loss phase of the program; and (3) if the customers referred to are not representative of the
general customer population of respondents' programs, either (a) the proportion of the total customer population
in respondents' programs that those customers represent, or (b) the statement that proposed respondents make no
claim that the results are representative of all participants in their programs. ( I.C)

The proposed orders further prohibit representations, in broadcast advertisements of thirty seconds or less, that
participants of any weight loss program have successfully maintained weight loss, unless proposed respondents
also:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940602-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Include the statement: ``Check at our centers for details about our maintenance record''; 

(2) For a period of time beginning with the date of the first broadcast advertisement of any such advertisement and
ending no sooner than thirty days after the last broadcast advertisement, comply with the following procedures for
information from a potential client: 

(a) Give to each potential customer a separate document that includes the maintenance information disclosures discussed
above; 

(b) Require each potential customer to sign this document; and 

(c) Give each customer a copy of the document, and retain a copy of the document ( I.D.) 

When proposed respondents use advertisements containing the endorsement or testimonial of one of their customers
about weight loss success or weight loss maintenance success, and the success depicted in the advertisement is not
representative of what their customers generally achieve, the proposed orders also require proposed respondents
to disclose what the generally expected success would be for customers of proposed respondents in losing weight or
maintaining weight loss, or one of several alternative statements that disclaim the typicality of the success depicted.
( I.E.) 



Rate of Weight Loss 



The Commission's three complaints also charge that all of the proposed respondents claimed that an appreciable number
of customers following their diet programs typically lose weight at an average rate of six or more pounds per week,
when they did not have a reasonable basis for those claims. The Commission's complaints against (1) DMLWC/DWLC and
Schuman and (2) QWLC-Tex., Gearheart, and Schuman also charge that these proposed respondents claimed that
customers following their diet programs typically lose weight at an average rate of thirty pounds in thirty days,
or three to eight pounds per week, when they did not have a reasonable basis for doing so. 

To remedy these practices, the proposed orders prohibit representations that customers will reach a specified weight
within a specified period of time, without having and relying upon competent and reliable scientific evidence to
support those claims. ( I.I.) The proposed orders also prohibit representations about the average or typical
rate or speed at which customers have lost or will lose weight, without having and relying upon competent and reliable
scientific evidence to support those claims. ( I.J.) 



Price 



The complaints further allege that proposed respondents falsely claimed that the prices they advertised for their
diet programs were the only costs associated with losing weight on their diet programs, and that their failure in such
advertisements to disclose the existence and amount of all mandatory expenses was a deceptive practice. 

The proposed orders seek to remedy these charges in several ways. First, the proposed orders prohibit untrue claims
that any price is the only the cost associated with losing weight on their diet programs. ( I.F.) Second, when
representing the price of their diet programs, the proposed orders also require proposed respondents either (1)
to disclose the existence and amount of all mandatory fees associated with the advertised diet programs, or (2) to
state in one of two ways that customers are required to purchase additional products or services. ( I.G.) Finally,
the proposed orders require telephone disclosures to all prospective customers who ask, or are otherwise told about,
the price of their weight loss programs, about the existence and amount of all mandatory fees. ( I.H.) 



Monitoring Practices 



The complaints also charge that proposed respondents engaged in deceptive monitoring practices. Proposed respondents
instructed their customers to check in with the weight loss centers three to six times per week so that proposed respondents
could monitor the weight loss progress of their customers. Sometimes, when the customers checked in, they presented
the proposed respondents with weight loss results indicating that they may not have been consuming all of the food
recommended by proposed respondents. The Commission's complaints charge that proposed respondents' failure to
disclose that this conduct could result in serious health complications was a deceptive practice. 

The proposed orders seek to remedy this practice by requiring proposed respondents to disclose that failure to eat
all of the food recommended may involve developing serious health complications. The proposed orders require proposed
respondents to make this disclosure either (1) to all customers in writing when they start the weight loss program,
or (2) to those customers who, after their first two weeks on the diet program, average a weekly weight loss that exceeds
2% of their initial body weight, or three pounds, whichever is less, for two consecutive weeks. ( I.K.) 



Medical Supervision 



Finally, the Commission's complaint against QWLC-Tex., Gearhart, and Schuman charges that these proposed respondents
falsely claimed that customers who participated in their diet programs were monitored by health professionals.


The proposed order addresses this allegation by prohibiting untrue representations that any weight loss program
is supervised or monitored by health care professionals, or other misrepresentations about the extent to which any
weight loss program is supervised or monitored by health care professionals. ( I.L.) 

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the three proposed orders. This analysis is not intended
to constitute an official interpretation of any of the agreements and proposed orders, or to modify in any way their
terms.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces a forthcoming meeting of a public advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
This notice also summarizes the procedures for the meeting and methods by which interested persons may participate
in open public hearings before FDA's advisory committees.



MEETING: 

The following advisory committee meeting is announced:



Science Board to the Food and Drug Administration



Date, time, and place

. June 28, 1994, 8:30 a.m., Parklawn Bldg., conference rm. D, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD.


Type of meeting and contact person

. Closed committee deliberations, 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.; open committee discussion, 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; open
public hearing, 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., unless public participation does not last that long; open committee discussion,
3:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.; Neil Wilcox, Office of the Senior Advisor for Science (HF-33), Food and Drug Administration,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-5839.


General function of the board

. The board provides advice primarily to the agency's Senior Science Advisor and, as needed, to the Commissioner and
other appropriate officials on specific complex and technical issues as well as emerging issues within the scientific
community in industry and academia. Additionally, the board provides advice to the agency on keeping pace with technical
and scientific evolutions in the fields of regulatory science; on formulating an appropriate research agenda; and
on upgrading its scientific and research facilities to keep pace with these changes. It also provides a means for critical
review of agency sponsored intramural and extramural scientific research programs.


Agenda_Open public hearing

. Interested persons may present data, information, or views, orally or in writing, on issues pending before the board.
Those desiring to make formal presentations must notify the contact person before June 14, 1994, and submit a brief
statement of the general nature of the evidence or arguments they wish to present and the names and addresses of proposed
participants. Each presenter will be limited in time and not all requests to speak may be able to be accommodated. All
written statements submitted in a timely fashion will be provided to the board.


Open committee discussion

. The board will discuss issues relevant to toxicity testing and their potential impact on the scientific effectiveness
of the agency. The discussion is designed to give the agency direction for future program development.


Closed committee deliberations

. The board will discuss information concerning nominations for the FDA award for scientific achievement, that if
discussed in public would disclose information of a personal nature which would constitute a clearly unwarranted
invasion of personal privacy (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(6)).
Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by 
participants. 
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

Proposed Reestablishment of the Copper Flat Mine in Sierra County, NM




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Notice of Scoping Meetings.

.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), Las Cruces District Office, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third
party contractor. The EIS will describe the potential impacts of the proposed re-establishment of the Copper Flat
open-pit copper mining project located approximately 5 miles northeast of Hillsboro in Sierra County, New Mexico.
The proposed Copper Flat Project would re-establish an open-pit copper mining operation at a site that was developed
and operated from April 1982 to July 1982. All surface facilities were removed from the site in 1986 and a BLM-approved
reclamation plan was implemented. The proposed Copper Flat Project would resume mining operations at the site and
would reconstruct the associated processing facilities. The proposed project would mine and process an average
of 16,500 tons of ore per day over a projected operating life of at least 10 years.


The public is invited to participate in the planning process. Public scoping meetings will be held at the following
times and locations:



Time/Date and Location


7 p.m. June 22, 1994: Truth or Consequences Civic Center, 400 West Forth Avenue, Truth or Consequences, New Mexico

7 p.m. June 23, 1994: Hillsboro Community Center (in the old High School Building), Hillsboro, New Mexico.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Gold Express Corporation submitted a Plan of Operations to BLM proposing to re-establish the Copper Flat Project
in 1991. As required by NEPA, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the proposed Plan of Operations. Based
on comments received on the EA and BLM's evaluation of the environmental impacts described in the EA, BLM notified
Gold Express Corporation by letter dated October 7, 1993, that an EIS would need to be prepared before the BLM could
approve the proposed Plan of Operations. Alta Gold Co. (Alta) acquired an option to purchase the Copper Flat Project
from Gold Express Corporation in July 1993 and has exercised the option.

<TEXT>
 

As proposed in the Plan of Operations, the project would be a conventional open-pit mining operation with an average
daily production of 16,500 tons of ore. Ore would be crushed and processed on site to produce a copper concentrate that
would be transported off-site for further processing. Waste rock and tailings produced by the proposed project would
be placed in disposal facilities located on site. Water for mining and processing purposes would be provided from
production wells located approximately 8 miles east of the mine site. In addition, ground water entering the pit would
be pumped out to facilitate mining operations. The project is expected to have a life of at least 10 years and would employ
approximately 150 people.

During the EA process, BLM identified four areas to be addressed in the EIS: (1) Potential impacts to the ground water
system from pumping of the production wells; (2) potential impacts to the ground water system from dewatering of the
pit; (3) potential impacts on ground water quality from placement of tailings in the tailings impoundment; and, (4)
potential impacts to surface and ground water quality from drainage from the overburden and waste rock disposal areas.
ELM is soliciting comments on these and other issues and opportunities to be addressed in the EIS.

BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) identification
of viable alternatives, and (3) notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information
concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of a news release announcing the start of
the EIS process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further
clarifies the proposed action and significant issues being considered to be distributed to those on the mailing list
and available upon request.

Grain-Oriented Silicon Electrical Steel From Italy and Japan 


Determination 


On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigations, the Commission determines,

2

 pursuant to section 705(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United States
is materially injured by reason of imports from Italy of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, provided for in
subheadings 7225.10.00, 7226.10.10, and 7226.10.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that
have been found by the Department of Commerce to be subsidized by the Government of Italy. The Commission further determines,

3

 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)), that an industry in the United States is materially injured
by reason of imports from Japan of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel that have been found by the Department
of Commerce to be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 







Background 


The Commission instituted these investigations effective January 28, 1994, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel from Italy were being subsidized
within the meaning of section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b(b)) and that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical
steel from Japan were being sold at LTFV within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice
of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was
given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 

Federal Register

 of February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8658). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on April 12, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 
The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on May 27, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2778 (May 1994), entitled ``Grain-oriented Silicon

 pursuant to section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)), that there is a reasonable indication that
an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports from Japan of stainless steel angles,

3

 provided for in subheading 7222.40.30 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged to
be sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 






Background 



On April 8, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Slater Steel Corp., Fort
Wayne, IN, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of LTFV imports of stainless
steel angles from Japan. Accordingly, effective April 8, 1994, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation
No. 731-TA-699 (Preliminary).

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(``CERCLA'')</DOCTITLE>




In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that a proposed consent decree in 

United States 

v.

 Apache Energy & Minerals Co., et al.,

 Civil Action No. 86-C-1675, concerning the California Gulch Superfund Site in and near Leadville, Colorado
(the ``Site'') was lodged on May 16, 1994 with the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The proposed
consent decree is between the United States and the State of Colorado, as plaintiffs and counter-defendants (collectively
the ``governments''), and defendants and counter-plaintiffs ASARCO Incorporated (``ASARCO''), Resurrection
Mining Company (``Resurrection''), Newmont Mining Corporation (``Newmont''), and the Res-ASARCO Joint Venture
(``Res-ASARCO'') (collectively the ``Settling Defendants'').


The decree provides for the reimbursement of the response costs incurred by the United States between February, 1991
and July, 1993, and the response costs incurred by the State of Colorado between February 1992 and July, 1993, from
Res-ASARCO in the combined amount of $7.6 million (the claims against the Settling Defendants for the governments'
response costs prior to these time periods having been previously addressed in a prior partial consent decree), and
the reimbursement of the governments' future response costs incurred at the Site after July, 1993 from ASARCO and
Resurrection in proportion to their assigned ``work areas'' under the decree. The decree establishes a process by
which ASARCO and Resurrection will perform and pay for the clean-up of assigned ``work areas'' within the Site which
are defined in the decree. In exchange for their commitments under the decree, the Settling Defendants are released
from any alleged liability at those portions of the Site outside their respective ``work areas,'' subject to specific
exclusions from the decree which are reserved for resolution at a later date.


The decree also resolves the counterclaims of the Settling Defendants against the governments, and the alleged liability
of the United States and the State at the Site, subject to the same exclusions applicable to the Settling Defendants
(plus one additional exclusion applicable to the United States), on a cash basis. Under the terms of the decree, the
United States will pay $6.1 million to ASARCO from the Judgment Fund plus an additional amount, not to exceed $4.05
million, equal to 15% of ASARCO's costs of implementing certain work under the decree if ASARCO's costs exceed $23
million. The State of Colorado will pay ASARCO a lump sum payment of $271,250.


The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer to

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Intermarket Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of the Withdrawal of an
Application for Registration as a Clearing Agency



May 25, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 The Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'') has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
notice of its intent to withdraw its request for permanent registration as a clearing agency and to terminate its temporary
registration as a clearing agency.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on ICC's proposal from interested persons.







I. Discussion



ICC is the commodity clearing subsidiary of The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC''). ICC commenced operations
in 1985 as a ``clearing organization,'' as defined in the rules promulgated under the Commodity Exchange Act,
 and therefore is subject to oversight and regulation by the CFTC. ICC guarantees, clears, and settles futures contracts,
options on futures contracts, and commodity options which are traded on those contract markets that have designated
ICC as their clearing organization.







Because the economic similarity between certain securities products and certain commodity products created opportunities
for intermarket hedging and arbitrage, ICC and OCC developed a program to offer cross-margining to joint members
of ICC and OCC.
 The original cross-margining program between ICC and OCC required a joint member to transfer positions in securities
options eligible for cross-margining from its OCC account to its account at ICC. Such options positions and futures
contracts eligible for cross-margining were margined at ICC based upon the net risk of the combined positions. ICC
held all positions, margin deposits, and clearing fund deposits with respect to the cross-margining program. ICC
was obligated to OCC to perform a participating joint member's obligations with respect to short positions in securities
options held in the joint member's ICC cross-margining account, and OCC remained obligated to collect and pay all
premiums for transactions in securities options and to effect settlement of all exercises. Because securities positions
were held and were margined at ICC and because ICC held all the margin deposits and clearing fund deposits with respect
to cross-margined positions, ICC believed that it could possibly be viewed as being within the Act's definition of
a clearing agency
 and therefore registered with the Commission as such.










Following regulatory approval of the cross-margining program between ICC and OCC, OCC entered into cross-margining
arrangements with several other commodity clearing organizations.
 Pursuant to those later cross-margining programs, instead of transferring all cross-margined option and futures
positions into an account held at one clearing organization, cross-margined option positions are held at OCC and
cross-margined futures positions are held at the participating commodity clearing organization. OCC and the participating
commodity clearing organization share information regarding the positions held in their cross-margining accounts
and treat the cross-margining accounts as being combined for purposes of calculating margin requirements. Collateral
deposited to satisfy margin requirements is subject to the joint control of OCC and the participating commodity clearing
organization. Members electing to participate in a cross-margining program must grant OCC and the participating
commodity clearing organization cross-liens on option positions maintained at OCC and on futures positions maintained
at the participating commodity clearing organization. Under this later cross-margining structure, a participating
commodity clearing organization is not considered to be within the Act's definition of a clearing agency and therefore
is not required to register with the Commission as such.










Recently, the cross-margining program between ICC and OCC was restructured so that it parallels the cross-margining
programs between OCC and other participating commodity clearing organizations.
 ICC believes that under the restructured cross-margining program it will no longer be acting as an intermediary in
making payments or deliveries in connection with securities transactions and therefore will not be a clearing agency
under the Act.
 Accordingly, ICC requests that its application for permanent registration with the Commission as a clearing agency
be withdrawn.









II. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization.

All submissions should refer to File No. SR-ICC-600-21 and should be submitted by July 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Enhanced Specialist
Participation in Parity Options Trades.</DOCTITLE>


May 25, 1994.


On August 9, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change relating to enhanced specialist participation in parity options trades. Notice of the proposal
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on September 20, 1993.
 One comment letter was received opposing the proposed rule change,
 to which the Phlx responded.
 On April 19, 1994, the Exchange filed Amendment No. 1.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.










Description of Proposal


In order to encourage the registration with the Exchange of New Units,
 the Exchange proposes to add now Commentary .17 to Rule 1014. Specifically, the proposal would enable New Units trading
New Options Classes,
 to execute 50% of the contracts in transactions where the New Unit is on parity with one registered options trader (``ROT''),
and 40% of the contracts in a transaction where the New Unit is on parity with two or more ROTs (``Enhanced Parity Split'');
provided, however, that no customer order which is on parity may receive a smaller participation than any other crowd
participant, including the specialist.








A New Unit can be formed by current ROTs and/or specialists as long as a new broker-dealer firm is established. Because
the proposal will be limited to New Options Classes, options classes that are leased or otherwise transferred from
an existing specialist to a New Unit, or that were listed on the Exchange prior to June 16, 1993, and which are assigned
to a New Unit, and not covered by the proposed rule.
The Enhanced Parity Split would be effective for a period of six months from the commencement of trading by the New Unite
of its first New Options Class.
 Furthermore, the Committee may extend the Enhanced Parity Split for one additional six month period upon petition
by the New Unit and a determination by the Committee that such extension is consistent with the promotion of just and
equitable principles of trade and the public interest.
 The Enhanced Parity Split will also be applicable to any additional New Options Classes that are assigned to a New Unit,
provided that at the time such classes are assigned, the New Unit is still entitled to receive the Enhanced Parity Split
on the first New Options Class it commenced trading pursuant to this rule.
 The Committee may terminate any extension of the Enhanced Parity Split if the Committee determines that such action
is consistent with the promotion of just and equitable principles of trade and the public interest.









Comment Letter


The Comment letter received opposing the proposed rule change made several arguments as to why the proposed rule change
is inappropriate.
 The commenter first argues that the Exchange has no evidence that granting an Enhanced Parity Split to New Units will
in any way benefit Phlx public customers. In fact, the letter argues that the proposed rule is anti-competitive and
will ultimately harm public customers by acting as a disincentive for ROTs to make competitive markets, thus removing
liquidity from the market. Shoreline believes that price competition is restricted whenever the specialist is granted
a benefit not available to the ROTs in the crowd. Shoreline also argues that there is no evidence that the Enhanced Parity
Split will encourage New Units to make tight and liquid markets, as the Phlx claims.




The commenter's next argument is that the proposed rule allows, but does not require, the New Unit to invoke the Enhanced
Parity Split. Shoreline believes that this further harms ROTs because there may be instances where ROTs are forced
to accept a greater percentage of an undesirable trade than they would if the New Unit is required to accept the Enhanced
Parity Split.
Shoreline also argues that by allowing existing specialists and ROTs to form New Units, the proposal does not serve
its stated purpose, which is to encourage the formation and registration with the Exchange of new specialist units.
Finally, the commenter argues that the Phlx has provided no specific criteria for maintaining or revoking the Enhanced
Parity Split with respect to a particular New Options Class. Shoreline believes that if the Enhanced Parity Split
is to be offered to New Units, the Committee should have objective standards to apply in making a determination of whether
to extend the Enhanced Parity Split for the allowed additional six month period.

Phlx Response


The Phlx refutes the arguments raised by Shoreline.
 First, the Phlx believes that the proposal will in fact add liquidity to the market, thus directly benefiting public
customers. The Phlx believes the proposal will attract new specialist units to the Exchange and will encourage these
New Units to make tight markets in New Options Classes in order to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Phlx argues
that because every newly listed options class is subject to multiple listings, disincentives are created which discourage
specialist units from acting as specialists for those new classes of options. The Phlx believes that the Enhanced
parity Split will counteract these disincentives by offering New Units a direct benefit if they are able to attract
order flow to the Exchange. The Exchange believes the New Units will be able to attract this order flow, and thus capitalize
on the Enhanced Parity Split, only if they maintain tight markets in the New Options Classes. As a result, the Phlx believes
that public customers will directly benefit from the proposed rule change.




The Phlx also disagrees with Shoreline's contention that any enhanced split is anti-competitive. First, the Enhanced
Parity Split is available to any market making firm that is willing to establish a New Unit. Secondly, the proposal
does not impact parity splits on existing options classes or New Options Classes traded by existing specialist units.
Finally, a market maker can always establish priority in a trade by improving the market or by being the first in establishing
a market that would otherwise be on parity.
In response to the commenter's claims that market makers are unfairly disadvantaged by this proposal, the Phlx makes
several arguments. First, the Phlx states that the claims that market makers will be hampered in hedging trades where
they improve the market does not take into account the possibility that the market maker may be able to hedge by improving
both sides of the market or by utilizing another options series for purposes of hedging. Additionally, the proposal
does not impact in any manner the ability of a market maker to hedge an options position with underlying stock. Further,
the Phlx argues that specialists have responsibilities and are subject to certain costs that market makers do not
have, such as, updating and disseminating quotes, reflecting all market interest in the displayed quotes, and the
fixed staffing cost committed to market making in a particular issue whether it is active or not. In order to attract
specialist units to the Exchange who are willing to accept these responsibilities, the Phlx believes it is necessary
to provide specialists with some benefits that are not available to ROTs. The Phlx believes that any negative impact
to ROTs that may be caused by this proposal is more than offset by the benefit to the Exchange and its customers of attracting
New Units to the Exchange.
The Phlx also refutes the commenter's claim that ROTs are further harmed because the New Unit is not required to invoke
the Enhanced Parity Split. The Phlx argues that because specialists and ROTs both desire to buy at the bid and sell at
the ask, there should be few undesirable trades where the specialist would not find it desirable to invoke the Enhanced
Parity Split. As a result, the Exchange believes that any negative impact on the ROTs as a result of the permissive nature
of the rule will be de minimis.
Finally, the Phlx argues that because the Enhanced Parity Split can apply to a New Options Class for at most one year,
the Exchange does not believe that detailed evaluative criteria for use in awarding or removing the Enhanced Parity
Split will be particularly effective or necessary. The Exchange believes that by the time that the New Unit establishes
a trading history which can be reviewed and evaluated, the Enhanced Parity Split will probably have lapsed. Even without
such criteria, however, the Phlx notes that the Committee has the ability to review the performance of a New Unit and
to remove the Enhanced Parity Split at the end of the initial six month period, or in more egregious cases, to reallocate
an options class for inadequate specialist performance.

Discussion 
 


The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5)
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market, and protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the proposal may serve to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by encouraging
the creation of New Units and by encouraging those New Units to maintain tight markets for New Options Classes in order
to attract order flow to the Exchange. The Commission believes the proposed rule change is a reasonable attempt by
the PHlx to enhance the ability of New Units to compete for order flow in the environment of multiply-traded options
classes. In addition, the protection of investors and the public interest is maintained because the Committee can
refuse to extend the Enhanced Parity Split for an additional six months if the performance of the New Unit does not warrant
an extension. Further, the proposed rule change provides the Enhanced Parity Split cannot disadvantage a public
customer order that is on parity with a New Unit.
 
 





The Commission agrees with the Exchange that in order to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Phlx needs to be able
to attract and retain well capitalized specialist units that are willing to trade New Options Classes, as well as existing
options classes. Further, the Commission disagrees with the commenter that the proposed rule change will disadvantage
public customers. On the contrary, the proposed rule change eliminates any direct injury to public customers by providing
that customer orders on parity may not receive a smaller participation than any other crowd participant, including
the specialist.
 Furthermore, because the proposal may serve to add liquidity to the market by encouraging New Units to maintain tight
markets in order to attract order flow to the Exchange, the Commission believes that public customers could benefit
from the proposed rule change.
 Accordingly, the Commission believes there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the proposed rule change will
disadvantage public customers. 
 





The Commission also acknowledges that specialists have responsibilities that ROTs do not have and that these responsibilities
have certain costs associated with them, such as the staff costs associated with continually updating and disseminating
quotes. As a result, the Commission believes it is reasonable for the Exchange to grant certain advantages, such as
the Enhanced Parity Split, to New Units in order to encourage New Units to register as specialists for New Options Classes.
Accordingly, as long as these advantages do not unreasonably restrain competition and do not harm investors, the
Commission believes that the granting of such benefits to specialists is within the business judgment of the Exchange.
Therefore, even though the proposed rule change could arguably have some negative impact on ROTs, for the reasons
stated above, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act.
 
 




Finally, the Commission agrees with the Phlx that the lack of quantifiable standards for the Committee to apply in
determining whether to extend the Enhanced Parity Split for an additional six month period does not make the proposal
unreasonable. Even if the Phlx proposed such standards, some time period would be necessary in order for the New Unit
to establish a trading history in the New Option Class in order for such a review to have any validity. In addition, the
Committee still will review the performance of the New Unit in determining whether to extend the Enhanced Parity Split
for an additional six months for particular New Options Classes. Because the Enhanced Parity Split can be in effect
for at most one year for each New Options Class, the Commission believes that the lack of such standards does not prevent
a finding that the proposal is consistent with the Act. 
 
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. First, Amendment No. 1 limits to one year the maximum time period during which the Enhanced Parity Split can exist
with respect to any New Options Class and provides that the proposed rule cannot disadvantage customer orders. The
purpose of the Enhanced Parity Split is to encourage New Units to maintain tight spreads in New Options Classes, which
is a benefit to investors. The Commission believes that providing such an incentive to specialists is appropriate
for New Options Classes for the period during which the market for such options classes is being established as long
as safeguards exist to ensure that customers are not harmed. As a result, the Commission believes these amendments
accomplish these goals consistent with the Act. Secondly, Amendment No. 1 also clarifies certain aspects of the proposed
rule change. The Commission believes that these amendments strengthen the proposed rule change by minimizing any
confusion that may arise as to the applicability of the rule. As a result, the Commission believes it is consistent
with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Phlx's proposal on an accelerated basis.

Applicants' Representations



1. Each of the Funds is a registered open-end management investment company. The Adviser serves as the Funds' investment
adviser, and the Distributor serves as the Funds' principal underwriter. In accordance with the terms of an exemptive
order, certain of the Funds offer multiple classes of shares with front-end sales loads, and in certain instances,
contingent deferred sales charges (``CDSCs'').
 Each of the existing Funds has adopted a rule 12b-1 plan.





2. The Trust is a registered unit investment trust that will offer units in series (``Trust Series''), each of which
will contain shares of one of the Funds that normally are offered with a sales load and U.S. Government zero coupon obligations
(``zero coupon obligations''). The Trust's objective is to provide protection of capital while providing for capital
appreciation through investments in zero coupon obligations and shares of the Funds. Each Trust Series will be organized
pursuant to a trust indenture which will incorporate a master trust agreement relating to the entire Trust and which
will name a qualified bank as trustee (the ``Trustee'').

3. Each Trust Series will be sponsored by the Sponsor, who will perform the functions typical of unit investment trust
sponsors, including: depositing fund shares in the Trust Series; acquiring zero coupon obligations and depositing
them in the Trust Series; arranging for the evaluation of the zero coupon obligations by an independent evaluator
(but not shares of the Funds since the Funds calculate net asset value daily); offering units to the public; and maintaining
a secondary market in units. The Sponsor expects to deposit in each Trust Series substantially more than $100,000
aggregate value of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares. Simultaneously with such deposit, the Trustee will deliver
to the Sponsor registered certificates for units which will represent the entire ownership of the Trust Series.

4. Units of the Trust Series will be offered to the public initially at prices based on the net asset value of the Fund
shares selected for deposit in the Trust Series plus the offering side value of the zero coupon obligations contained
therein plus a sales charge. The Trust Series will redeem units at prices based on the aggregate bid side evaluation
of the zero coupon obligations plus the net asset value of the Fund shares.

5. With the deposit of the securities in the Trust Series on the initial date of deposit, the Sponsor will have established
a proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares in the Trust
Series. The Sponsor will be permitted under the trust agreement to deposit additional securities, but will maintain
the original proportionate relationship between the principal amounts of zero coupon obligations and Fund shares
in the Trust Series. Fund shares may be redeemed only to meet redemptions by unitholders or to pay Trust Series expenses
in the event that distributions received on Fund shares prove insufficient to cover the expenses.

6. The Trust Series will be structured so that each Trust Series will contain a sufficient amount of zero coupon obligations
to assure that, at the specified maturity date for such Trust Series, the purchaser of a unit will receive back the approximate
total amount of the original investment in the Trust Series, including the sales charge. The Sponsor intends to maintain
a secondary market for Trust Series units based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the zero coupon obligations
and the net asset value of the Fund shares, but is not obligated to do so. In the event that the Sponsor does not maintain
a secondary market, the trust agreement will provide that the Sponsor will not instruct the Trustee to sell zero coupon
obligations from any Trust Series until shares of the Fund have been liquidated, unless the Trustee is able to sell
such zero coupon obligations and still maintain at least the original proportionate relationship to unit value and,
further, that zero coupon obligations cannot be sold to meet Trust Series expenses.

7. The sales load that normally would be applicable on sales of underlying Fund shares will be waived. The Sponsor and
the Distributor will rebate to the Trustee any rule 12b-1 fees they receive on shares of the Funds held by the Trust
Series.

8. Applicants have taken certain steps to reduce the impact of the termination of a Trust Series on the Fund deposited
therein. First, the Trust Series will, with respect to all unitholders still holding units at the scheduled termination
and to the extent desired by such unitholders, transfer the registration of their proportionate number of Fund shares
from the Trust Series to the investor in lieu of redeeming such shares. Second, the Fund will offer all such unitholders
the option of investing the proceeds from the zero coupon obligations in Fund shares at net asset value (

i.e.,

 without the imposition of the normal sales load). The Fund also will offer unitholders the option of investing all
distributions from the Trust Series during the life of the Trust Series in Fund shares at net asset value.



Applicants' Legal Conclusions



1. Section 12(d)(1) generally limits acquisition by an investment company of shares of a registered investment company
in the following ways: (1) The acquiring company may not acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of the acquired company;
(2) the securities of the acquired company may not amount to more than 5% of the value of the assets of the acquiring company;
and (3) securities of the acquired company and all other investment companies may not represent more than 10% of the
assets of the acquiring company.

2. A major purpose of section 12(d)(1) is to prevent the duplication of costs and other adverse consequences to investors
incident to the pyramiding of investment companies. This proposal is structured to eliminate the pyramiding of expenses.
No sales charge or distribution fee will be imposed on Fund shares deposited in the Trust. No investment advisory fee
will be charged with respect to the Trust Series since they will be unmanaged, and no evaluation fee will be charged
with respect to Fund shares in the Trust Series. Another concern addressed by 12(d)(1) is potentially abusive control
problems that could result from the concentration of voting power in a fund holding company. To address this concern,
applicants have agreed that shares of a Fund that are held by a Trust Series will be voted by the Trustee in the same proportion
as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust Series are voted. Another concern underlying section 12(d)(1)
is the possibility of large-scale redemptions of shares of the underlying fund. The trust agreement will, however,
permit the Trust Series to sell Fund shares only when necessary to meet redemptions or pay Trust Series expenses. Neither
the Trustee nor the Sponsor will have any discretionary authority to determine when shares of the underlying Funds
are to be sold or to substitute shares of another Fund for those deposited in a Trust Series. The threat to a Fund from
large-scale redemptions is further reduced by the fact that each Trust Series is prohibited from acquiring more than
10% of the outstanding shares of any Fund.

3. Section 14(a) requires that investment companies have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering.
Applicants recognize that by withdrawing certificates representing the entire beneficial ownership of the Trust
Series, the Sponsor may be deemed to be reducing the Trust Series' net worth below the requirements of section 14(a).
Applicants intend to comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a-3, which provides an exemption
from section 14(a), except that the Trust Series would not restrict its portfolio to ``eligible trust securities.''

4. Section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 provide that, except under limited circumstances, no registered investment
company may distribute long-term gains more than once every twelve months. These provisions were designed to remove
the temptation to realize capital gains on a frequent and regular basis and to eliminate attempts by investment advisers
to time distributions to be advantageous to shareholders. Moreover, there was concern that investors would be confused
by a failure to distinguish between regular distributions of capital gains and distributions of investment income.
Applicants request an exemption from Rule 19b-1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection
with the redemption of Fund shares to be distributed to unitholders along with the Trust Series' regular distributions.
The requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of section 19(b) and rule 19b-1 because the dangers
of manipulation of capital gains and confusion between capital gains and regular income distributions does not exist
in the Trust Series. The Trust Series and their Sponsor have substantially no control over events, other than the selection
of the portfolio, which might trigger capital gains (

i.e.,

 the tendering of units for redemption). Moreover, because distributions of capital are clearly indicated in accompanying
reports to unitholders as a return of principal, the danger of confusion is not present in the operations of the Trust
Series.
5. Section 22(d) generally prohibits a registered investment company from selling its shares except at a current
offering price described in the prospectus. Applicants request an exemption from the provisions of section 22(d)
to permit the waiver of any otherwise applicable CDSC where: (a) The Sponsor has purchased such shares in connection
with the sale of units; (b) the proceeds of zero-coupon obligations upon termination of a Trust Series, and distributions
from a Trust Series made during the existence of the Trust Series, ahve been reinvested by a unitholder in additional
Fund shares; and (c) a Trust Series at maturity has transferred a unitholder's proportionate number of Fund shares
from the Trust Series to the unitholder in lieu of redeeming such shares. Waiver of the sales load will not harm the Funds
or remaining shareholders. All Funds whose shares are subject to any sales load will fully disclose the waiver provision
in their prospectuses.
6. Section 11(a) makes it unlawful for an registered open-end investment company or principal underwriter for such
company to make certain offers of exchange on any basis other than the relative net asset value of the securities to
be exchanged, unless the terms of the exchange offer have first been approved by the SEC. Section 11(c) provides that
section 11(a) will be applicable to any type of exchange offer involving securities of a registered unit investment
trust, irrespective of the basis of exchange. Applicants seek an order pursuant to section 11 (a) and (c) approving
the termination option described below. At the termination of the Trust Series, unitholders still holding units
at maturity will have the option of either (a) transferring the registration of their proportionate number of Fund
shares from the Trust Series to a registration in the investor's name, or (b) receiving a cash distribution. Such unitholders
also will have the option of either (a) reinvesting the proceeds of the zero-coupon obligations in additional shares
of the Fund (without imposition of the normal sales load), or (b) receiving a cash distribution. The exchange will
be made on the basis of the net asset value of the Fund shares.
7. Section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 make it unlawful for any affiliated person of, or principal underwriter for a
registered investment company, or any affiliated person of either of them, acting as a principal, to engage in a joint
transaction with the investment company unless the joint transaction has been approved by the SEC. Applicants believe
that the proposed arrangements are consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act, and participation
by each registered investment company is not on a basis less advantageous than that of other participants.


Applicants' Conditions


Applicants agree to the following as conditions to the granting of the requested order:
1. The Trustee will not redeem Fund shares except to the extent necessary to meet redemptions of units by unitholders,
or to pay Trust expenses should distributions and rebated 12b-1 fees received on Fund shares prove insufficient
to cover such expenses.
2. Any rule 12b-1 fees received by the Sponsor or the underwriters of Fund shares in connection with the distribution
of Fund shares to the Trust will be promptly rebated to the Trustee.
3. No one Trust Series will, at the time of any deposit of any Fund shares, hold as a result of that deposit, more than 10%
of the then-outstanding shares of a Fund.
4. All Trust Series investing in shares of the same Fund will be structured so that their maturity dates will be at least
thirty days apart from one another.
5. Applicants will comply in all respect with the requirements of rule 14a-3, except that the Trust Series will
not restrict their portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.''
6. Shares of a Fund which are held by a Trust Series will be voted by the Trustee of the Trust, and the Trustee will vote
all shares of a Fund held in a Trust Series in the same proportion as all other shares of that Fund not held by the Trust
are voted.
7. No sales charge or redemption fee will be imposed on any shares of the Funds deposited in any Trust Series or on any
shares acquired by unitholders through reinvestment of dividends or distributions or through reinvestment at termination.
8. Applicants agree to comply with rule 6c-10 as currently proposed, and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.
9. The prospectus of each Trust Series and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of a reinvestment
option will disclose that unitholders who elect to invest in Fund shares will incur a rule 12b-1 fee.

Applicants' Representations





1. The Funds are open-end management investment companies. Each Fund other than Fortis Fiduciary Fund and Fortis
Growth Fund is organized as a series investment company and is authorized to issue its shares in more than one series.
Fortis Fiduciary Fund and Fortis Growth Fund currently are authorized to issue only one series of shares. The Adviser
serves as the investment adviser of each Fund. The Underwriter serves as the principal underwriter of the shares of
each Fund.


2. The Fortis Money Fund series of Fortis Money Portfolios offers one class of shares at net asset value without the
imposition of a FESC or CDSC. Each of the other Funds offers one class of shares at net asset value plus a front-end sales
charge (``FESC'') in connection with investments of up to $1 million. Investments of $1 million or more are not subject
to a FESC, but rather a CDSC, which is permitted by the Prior Order.







A. Variable Pricing System




1. Applicants, on behalf of themselves and future investment companies for which the Adviser, or any person controlled
by or under common control with the Adviser, may serve as investment adviser, or for which the Underwriter, or any person
controlled by or under common control with the Underwriter, may serve as principal underwriter, request an order
that would permit the Funds to issue multiple classes of shares and to assess a CDSC. The order would supersede the Prior
Order and would permit the Funds to impose CDSC schedules that may be different from the one described in that order.



2. Under applicants' proposal, the Funds could offer classes of shares either: (a) Subject to a FESC (with respect
to investments of less than $1 million) or a CDSC (with respect to investments of $1 million or more) and subject to a
12b-1 distribution plan (``Class A shares'');
 (b) subject to a CDSC (expected to range from 4% on redemptions made during the first two years following purchase to
1% on redemptions made during the sixth year), a rule 12b-1 distribution plan with a service fee at an annual rate
of up to .25% and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75% of average daily net assets, and an automatic conversion
to Class A after a certain period of time (``Class B shares''); (c) subject to a CDSC (expected to be 1% on redemptions
made during the first two years following purchase), a rule 12b-1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% and
a rule 12b-1 distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75% of average daily net assets (``Class C shares'');
(d) subject to a FESC, a rule 12b-1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a rule 12b-1 distribution
fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average daily net assets (``Class D shares''); (e) subject to a FESC (with respect
to investments of less than $1 million) or a CDSC (with respect to investments of $1 million or more) but not subject
to rule 12b-1 fees (``Class E shares'');
 (f) without a FESC or CDSC, but subject to a rule 12b-1 service fee at an annual rate of up to .25% of average daily
net assets, for purchase exclusively by investors meeting such minimum investment and/or other eligibility requirements
established by applicants (``Class Y shares''); and (g) without any sales or service charges for purchase exclusively
by the Adviser, the Underwriter, certain agents and affiliates of the Adviser and Underwriter, and officers, directors,
and employees of such entities (``Class Z shares''). The Funds also may establish one or more additional classes to
be sold with different sales loads and service and distribution fee structures.






3. Class B shares of a Fund held for a specified number of years will convert automatically to Class A shares of such Fund
at the relative net asset values of each of the classes.
 For purposes of calculating the holding period, Class B shares will be deemed to have been issued on the sooner of: (a)
The date on which the issuance of Class B shares occurred; or (b) for Class B shares obtained through an exchange, or
a series of exchanges, the date on which the issuance of the original Class shares occurred.







4. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares
are also Class B shares. However, for purposes of conversion to Class A, all Class B shares in a shareholder's Fund account
that were purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Class B shares
(and which have not converted to Class A shares) will be considered to be held in a separate sub-account. Each time any
Class B shares in the shareholder's Fund account (other than those in the sub-account) convert to Class A, a 

pro rata

 portion of the Class B shares then in the sub-account also will convert to Class A. The portion will be determined by
the ratio that the shareholder's Class B shares converting to Class A bears to the shareholder's total Class B shares
not acquired through dividends and distributions.



5. A class of shares will be exchangeable only for shares of the corresponding class of other Funds. all exchanges between
Funds will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.




6. The classes of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and will be identical in all
respects except: (a) Each class would have a different designation; (b) each class may bear any rule 12b-1 plan
payments related to that class (and any other costs related to obtaining shareholder approval of the rule 12b-1
plan for that class or an amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan); (c) each class may bear expenses determined by the
board of directors to be allocated to that class, which are set forth in condition 1 below; (d) only shareholders of
the affected classes would be entitled to vote on matters pertaining to the rule 12b-1 plan relating to their
respective class in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1; (e) each class would have different
exchange privileges; and (f) classes that impose a rule 12b-1 fee may convert into another class.

7. The sum of any FESC, service fees, distribution fees, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided
for in Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'').

8. Because of the varying levels of rule 12b-1 fees and other class-level expenses paid by the holders of different
classes of shares, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on each class may differ and, consequently,
different classes of shares may have different net asset values.



B. The CDSC



1. Applicants also request an exemption that would permit the Funds to impose a CDSC and to waive the CDSC in certain
cases. With respect to any class of shares of any Fund that charge a CDSC, the applicable CDSC will be calculated on the
lesser of the net asset value at the time of the issuance or redemption of the shares. No CDSC will be imposed on: (a) Shares,
or amounts representing shares, purchased through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions;
(b) an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shares due to capital appreciation; or (c) shares held
for longer than the applicable CDSC period. Upon any request for redemption of shares that imposes a CDSC, it will be
assumed, unless otherwise requested, that shares subject to no CDSC will be redeemed first in the order purchased
(however, if a shareholder owns more than one class of shares, then shares not subject to a CDSC with the highest rule
12b-1 fee will be redeemed in full prior to any redemption of shares not subject to a CDSC with a lower rule 12b-1
fee), all remaining shares that are subject to a CDSC will be redeemed in the order purchased.

2. Applicants request the ability to waive the CDSC in the following instances: (1) Involuntary redemptions effected
pursuant to a Fund's right to liquidate shareholder accounts having an aggregate net asset value of less than the minimum
account balance set forth in the Fund's then current prospectus; (b) the death or disability of a Fund shareholder
within the meaning of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code; (c) in connection with redemptions of any shares
held by tax-qualified retirement plans, excluding individual retirement accounts, simplified employee pension
plans, section 403(b) plans and section 457 plans; (d) in connection with purchases of shares funded by the proceeds
from the redemption of shares of any unrelated investment company that charges a FESC, provided that there was no CDSC,
fee, or other charge imposed in connection with such redemption and if the purchase is made within 60 days following
the redemption; (e) in connection with purchases of Fund shares funded by the proceeds from the surrender of a fixed
annuity contract within 60 days of the purchase of Fund shares; (f) in connection with purchases of Fund shares by the
following categories of investors and transactions; (i) Fortis, Inc., and its subsidiaries and specified persons
associated with such companies; (ii) Fund directors and officers and specified persons associated with such directors
and officers; (iii) representatives or employees of the Underwriter (including agencies) or of the other broker-dealers
having a sales agreement with the Underwriter and specified persons associated with such entities; (iv) pension,
profit-sharing and other retirement plans of the persons referenced in clause (i), (ii) and (iii), (v) registered
investment companies; (vi) registered investment advisers, trust companies and bank trust departments exercising
discretionary authority or using a money management/mutual fund ``wrap'' program; (vii) purchases that are funded
by the proceeds from the plans referenced in clause (iv) upon the retirement or employment termination of such persons;
(viii) purchases by employees (including their spouses and dependent children) of banks and other financial services
firms that provide referral and administrative services pursuant to a sales agreement with the Underwriter or one
of its affiliates; (ix) with respect to Asset Allocation Portfolio of Advantage Portfolios only, former officers
and directors of Morison Asset Allocation Fund, and officers, directors and employees of Morison Asset Management,
Inc. and its affiliates; (x) with respect to Government Total Return Portfolio of Advantage Portfolios only, officers
and trustees of the Olympus Funds Trust, officers, directors and employees of Furman Selz Capital Management, and

Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and (18)(i) of the
Act to the extent that the proposed issuance of various classes of shares representing interests in the same Fund might
be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1),
and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement
does not present the concerns that section 18 was designed to address. The multi-class arrangement does not involve
borrowing, nor will it affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure.

2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c-1 thereunder to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive a CDSC on redemption of shares.
The order would supersede the Prior Order and would permit the Funds to impose CDSC schedules that may be different
from the one described in the Prior Order.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The designation to each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a rule
12b-1 plan providing from a service and/or distribution fee; (c) different expenses which the board of directors
of a Fund may in the future determine to allocate to a specific class (``class-specific expenses''), which will be
limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class;
(ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares;
(iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services
as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely
to one class of shares; and (vii) director's fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (d)
voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares (

e.g.,

 the adoption, amendment, or termination of a rule 12b-1 plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in
rule 12b-1 (except as provided in condition 15 below); (e) the different exchange privileges of the various
classes of shares as described in the prospectuses of the Funds; and (f) classes that impose a 12b-1 fee may convert
to another class. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently
identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until approved
by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The directors of each the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the variable
pricing system prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors
of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the variable pricing system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed variable pricing
system is in the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

3. The initial determination of the class-specific expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class
of a Fund and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected
Fund, including a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class-specific expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose of which the expenditures
were made.

4 On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes of shares.
The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Underwriter will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Underwriter at their
own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale of servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to
the class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval
of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the rule 12b-1 plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each class and except that any
class-specific expenses will be borne by the applicable class of shares.

7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Independent
Examiner''). The Independent Examiner has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating
that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in
an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Independent Examiner, or an appropriate substitute Independent
Examiner, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review,
will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly.
The reports of the Independent Examiner shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to
sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Independent Examiner with respect to such reports, following
request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written
request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the
SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant
Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the
Independent Examiner is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will
be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and
described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be
adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of
income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Independent
Examiner in its initial report referred to in condition (7) above and will be concurred with by the Independent Examiner,
or appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred
to in condition (7) above. The applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if the Independent Examiner,
or an appropriate substitute Independent Examiner, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.

9. The prospectuses of the Funds will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.

10. The Underwriter will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these
standards.

11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the variable pricing system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the
directors.

12. Each Fund prospectus (regardless of whether all classes of shares of such Fund are offered through such prospectus)
will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, FESC, CDSC,
exchange privileges, and conversion features applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports of each
Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder
report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations,
information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data and ratios,
however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement
or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will disclose
the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will separately present
each class of shares.

13. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply
SEC approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant
to rule 12b-1 plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class
shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such actions may include the exchange of
all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class
shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class
or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this
condition shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation.
In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New
Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Underwriter. Purchase Class shares
sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payments,
provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class
shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed Rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Payden & Rygel Investment Group, et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



May 26, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS:

 Payden & Rygel Investment Group (the ``Trust''), Payden & Rygel (the ``Adviser''), and Payden & Rygel
Distributors, Inc. (the ``Distributor'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS:

 Exemption requested under section 6(c) from sections 18(f), 18(g), and 18(i).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek a conditional order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f), 18(g), and 18(i) to the
extent necessary to permit each of the Trust's existing and future investment portfolios (the ``Funds'') to issue
two classes of shares.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. The Trust is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.
The original name of the Trust was P&R Investment Trust. The Trust currently is comprised of five Funds: The Payden
& Rygel Global Fixed Income Fund, the Payden & Rygel Short Bond Fund, the Payden & Rygel Intermediate
Bond Fund, the Payden & Rygel Opportunity Fund, and the Payden & Rygel Tax Exempt Bond Fund. Currently, shares
of each Fund primarily are offered to pension and profit sharing plans, employee benefit trusts, endowments, foundations,
other institutions, corporations, and individuals with high net worth.

<DOCNO> FR940602-2-00131 </DOCNO>

2. The Trust has entered into an investment management agreement with the Adviser, a registered investment adviser,
whereby the Adviser manages the investment of the assets of the Funds and reviews, supervises, and administers all
investments of the Funds. Shares of each Fund are distributed through the Distributor, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Adviser. No compensation is payable by any Fund to the Distributor for its services. The Winston Company Limited
Partnership (the ``Administrator'') serves as administrator to the Funds pursuant to an administrative agreement
with the Trust. Under the administration agreement, the Administrator receives a monthly fee from the Funds based
on a specified schedule of rates that is based on the Funds' average daily net assets. The Winsbury Service Corporation,
an affiliate of the Administrator, provides accounting, dividend disbursing, and transfer agency services pursuant
to a separate agreement with the Trust.

3. Applicants request a conditional order to permit each portfolio of the Fund to offer an additional class of shares
(``Class B shares'') that would be identical to existing shares except that Class B shares would be subject to a non-rule
12b-1 shareholder service plan (the ``Plan''). Under the requested order, the existing shares would be ``Class
A'' shares that would no be subject to a Plan and related fees. The Plan would authorize each Fund to compensate the Distributor
and other securities broker-dealers and service organizations for shareholder services provided to Class B shareholders.
Services to be provided under the Plan may include: (a) Establishing and maintaining client/shareholder accounts
and records; (b) aggregating and processing purchase, exchange, and redemption requests; (c) investing the assets
of clients' accounts in Class B shares pursuant to specified pre-authorized instructions; (d) arranging for bank
wires; (e) providing sub-accounting services and preparing tax reports and forms on behalf of shareholders; and
(f) forwarding shareholder communications from the Funds.

4. It currently is contemplated that the service organizations would be compensated at an annual rate of up to 0.20%
of the daily net asset value of the Class B shares of each Fund. The fees would be payable even if the amounts paid exceed
the service organizations' actual expenses. 

5. The services provided under the Plan are not primarily intended to result in the sale or distribution of Fund shares.
Applicants in all cases will comply with article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association
of Securities Dealers as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges that may be exposed.

6. All transfer agency expenses and other expenses incurred with respect to a specific class will be borne by that class.
All other expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated between the two classes of shares based on the net assets of the
Fund attributable to each class. Because of the service fees paid by Class B shareholders, the net income attributable
to and the dividends payable on the Class B shares generally will be lower than those of the Class A shares. As a result,
the net asset value per share of each class generally will differ. 

7. Shares of the Funds generally may be exchanged at net asset value for shares of other Funds. The exchange privilege
will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



Applicants request an order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to
the extent that the proposed creation of the Class B shares may result in one class having priority over another as to
payment of dividends, and thus be a ``senior security'' as defined in section 18(g) of the Act, and prohibited under
section 18(f). The creation of Class B shares, where Class B shareholders would be entitled to exclusive voting rights
with respect to matters concerning the Plan, also may violate the equal voting provision of section 18(i). 

2. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive demands
of today's financial services industry. Under the dual distribution system, an investor will be able to choose the
method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial to an investor given his or her relevant circumstances.

3. Applicants assert that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights in the manner described is equitable
and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. In addition, these arrangements should not give rise
to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges of such class of shares are substantially identical.

4. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement does not present the concerns that section 18 of the Act was designed
to ameliorate. The dual distribution system will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Fund.
The arrangement does not involve borrowing, nor will it affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves, and does not
involve a complex capital structure. Nothing in the dual distribution system suggests that it will facilitate control
by holders of any class of shares.



Applicants' Conditions



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of a Fund, (b) the exclusive right of Class B shares to vote on matters
related to the Plan, (c) the impact of the disproportionate payments made under the Plan, (d) the incremental transfer
agency costs attributable to the Class B shares of the Fund; (e) printing and postage expenses related to preparing
and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current shareholders
of a specific class; (f) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (g) the expense of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (h) trustees' fees or expenses incurred
as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; (i) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of shares;
(j) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by one class of shares; (k) litigation of other legal expenses related solely
to one class of shares; and (l) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated
to one or more classes of shares that shall be approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.

2. The Trust's board of trustees, including a majority of trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, will
approve the dual distribution structure. The minutes of the meetings of the board of trustees regarding the deliberations
of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the dual distribution system will reflect in
detail the reasons for the trustees' determination that the dual distribution system is in the best interests of both
the Funds and their respective shareholders. 
3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will
monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the two classes of shares. The
trustees, including a majority of the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust, will take such action as
is reasonably necessary to eliminate any conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible
for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company. 
4. The plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through
(f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that the shareholders need not
receive the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1. 
5. The board of trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning shareholder servicing expenditures
complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements,
only expenditures properly attributable to the servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any
servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the servicing of a particular class will not be presented
to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which
they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the trustees who are not interested persons of the trust
in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to teach class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments for services
described in condition 1 above that are rendered to a particular class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class.

7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, and dividends and distributions of the two
classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report of applicants, which has been provided
to the staff of the SEC, stating that the methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that the calculations and
allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made, and, based upon this review, will
render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports
of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1)
of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to these reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds
agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to a Fund for these work
papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director,
the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate
and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in
operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of
operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time,
or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 
8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the two classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
between the two classes of shares, and this representation will be concurred with by the Expert in the initial report
referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Export, on an
ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate
corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 
9. The conditions pursuant to which the order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees of the
Trust with respect to the Plan will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees. 
10. Each Fund will disclose in its prospectus the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements,
services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to the two classes of shares,
regardless of whether both classes of shares in the portfolio are offered through the same prospectus. Each Fund will
disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every shareholder report.
The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement operations, information
related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared
on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses and/or performance data applicable to either class of shares, it will also disclose the respective
expenses and/or performance data applicable to the other class of shares of such Fund. The information provided by
applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value or public offering price
will separately present this information for each class of shares of such Fund. 
11. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
the Plan in reliance on the exemptive order. 
12. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Trust including a majority of
the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees shall
review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made. 
13. The prospectus of each fund will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect to
one particular class of shares over another in the Fund. 
14. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares to agree to conform to such standards.

<AGENCY>

Department of State.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Public Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that all licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise transfer defense articles or defense
services to Rwanda are suspended until further notice pursuant to Sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

United Nations Security Council Resolution 918 requires that all States prevent the sale or supply to Rwanda by their
nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels or aircraft of arms and related materiel of all types,
including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary police equipment and spare parts.
On May 26, 1994, the President issued Executive Order 12918 implementing the Security Council arms embargo on Rwanda.
Pursuant to the Executive Order, the following activities are prohibited:



(a) The sale or supply to Rwanda from the territory of the United States by any person, or by any United States person
in any foreign country or other location, or using any U.S.-registered vessel or aircraft, of arms and related materiel
of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary police equipment,
and spare parts for the aforementioned, irrespective of origin.
(b) Any willful evasion or attempt to violate or evade any of the prohibitions set forth in the order.



Pursuant to the Executive Order, section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778)(AECA), and the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120-130)(ITAR), the export or other transfer to Rwanda of defense
articles and services is prohibited.


It is the policy of the U.S. Government to deny all applications for licenses and other approvals to export or otherwise
transfer defense articles and services to Rwanda. All such applications which have been submitted since the current
strife in Rwanda began on April 6, 1994 have been denied. In addition, U.S. manufacturers and exporters and any other
affected parties are hereby notified that the Department of State has suspended all previously issued licenses and
approvals authorizing the export or other transfer of defense articles or defense services to Rwanda. These actions
have been taken pursuant to Sections 38 and 42 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2791) and  126.7 of the ITAR.
The licenses and approvals that have been suspended include any manufacturing licenses, technical assistance agreements,
technical data, and commercial military exports and reexports of any kind involving Rwanda subject to the AECA. This
action also precludes the use in connection with Rwanda of any exemptions from licensing or other approval requirements
included in the ITAR, with the exception of those exemptions specified in  126.1(a).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared
for the construction of a Mississippi River crossing, which would add capacity and divert traffic from the Poplar
Street Bridge between Missouri and Illinois. The proposed project study area will extend from the McKinley Bridge
on the north to Illinois Route 157, or Cherokee Street in St. Louis, on the south.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed action is to construct a new crossing of the Mississippi River at downtown St. Louis. The proposed project
study area will extend from the McKinley Bridge on the north to Illinois Route 157, or Cherokee Street in St. Louis,
on the south.



The need for a new Mississippi River crossing is based on the transportation demands, safety considerations and the
opportunity for economic enhancement in the greater downtown St. Louis and East St. Louis area. The Poplar Street
Bridge, which presently caries 128,000 vehicles per day, is operating over capacity in the peak periods, resulting
in delays and congestion. By the year 2020, this condition will deteriorate and affect all of the other existing crossings.

Consideration of facility type to this point has been focused on a freeway to freeway bridge with two possible alternates
identified within the study area. Because this project qualifies as a major metropolitan transportation investment,
the St. Louis Metropolitan Planning Organization (East-West Gateway Coordinating Council) and the Illinois Department
of Transportation, the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Authority are currently applying
major transportation analysis procedures to determine other alternate modes which may be considered.

In addition to the major investment analysis, an informal scoping process will be undertaken as part of this project.
The process will include meetings, review sessions as appropriate, and discussions at regularly scheduled meetings.
Participants will include the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, the Missouri Highway and Transportation
Department and other Federal, State and local agencies. Further details and a scoping information packet may be obtained
from one of the contact persons listed above.

To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to FHWA or IDOT contact persons at the addresses provided above.

the coordinated exchange of scientific information collected as a result of the studies conducted. 
Impact trauma research employs the principles of mechanics to discover the physical response and physiological
results of impacts to the human body. Generally, the teams doing the research are comprised of individuals from different
disciplines: engineering, physiology, medicine, biology, and anatomy. The team studies the physical response
of the body to impact by measuring and recording engineering parameters defining the event, such as force, accelerations,
displacements, surface contours, strains, pressure, etc., and observing the physiological consequences in terms
of physical or functional alterations to the body. 
One of the major research materials used to simulate injury to the living human is the human cadaver (hereinafter referred
to as a human surrogate) exposed to impact and detailed response measurement. 
The focus of this cooperative research effort is the study of human surrogate response and injury to physical impacts
simulating some significant aspect of automotive impact injury, 

i.e.

, head, neck, torso, or lower extremity injury produced in drivers and passengers, restrained by various safety devices
and exposed to either a frontal, lateral, or rear impact. The specific objectives of this cooperative research effort
are to: (1) Delineate the mechanism of injury, (2) develop functional relationships between the measurable engineering
parameters and the extent and severity of injury, and (3) quantify the impact response of the body in such a way as to
allow the development of mechanical analogs of the human body.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice, adoption of final policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service is adopting revised policies and procedures for administering special use permits that authorize
privately owned recreation residences on National Forest System lands. This action is in response to an administrative
appeal decision by the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment that found that
certain portions of the policy adopted on August 16, 1988, exceeded agency authority. The decision directed that
those portions of the policy be stayed from implementation pending reformulation and publication of a revised policy
in the 

Federal Register

. In addition to adopting new provisions affected by the appeal decision, this final policy also conforms administrative
provisions to revisions in the Secretary of Agriculture's Administrative Appeal regulations governing authorizations
for occupancy and use of National Forest System lands, adopted after the original recreation residence policy. This
final policy also clarifies the policy for determination of annual rental fees. The intended effect of this action
is to administer recreation residence authorizations consistent with statutory authority.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 16, 1988, the Forest Service adopted a final policy and procedures for administering special use permits
that authorize privately-owned recreation residences on national Forest System lands (53 FR 30924). The policy
established a new procedure for calculating annual fees, gave direction on tenure and renewability of the permits,
and described procedures to be followed when the recreation residence lot was needed for a higher public purpose



This policy was appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture on September 15, 1988. The appellants alleged that the process
by which this policy was developed was flawed because the policy exceeded statutory limitations on recreation residence
use of the National Forests, and that the appellants and the public were adversely affected by the policy

In a decision dated February 15, 1989, the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and Environment
remanded the policy to the Forest Service for restudy and reformulation and stayed the implementation of certain
provisions of the 1988 policy as follows: (1) Those nonrenewal provisions relating to or requiring a showing of higher
public purpose where the lands occupied were deemed needed for other than recreation residences; (2) those provisions
requiring automatic permit renewal 10 years prior to expiration unless nonrenewal had been established; (3) those
provisions requiring the offering of ``in-lieu'' lots to permittees who had received notice of nonrenewal or termination;
and (4) those provisions weighted against consideration of commercial uses for lots when nonrenewal of the recreation
use was contemplated. Further, the decision expressed concern about other provisions of the policy, such as fee determination
procedures. In addition, the Assistant Secretary required that the remaining features of the final policy be designated
as interim policy pending its reformulation following all applicable process requirements.

The policy adopted August 16, 1988, was issued as direction to Forest Service personnel through amendments and interim
directives to Forest Service Manual (FSM) chapters 2340 and 2720 and Forest Service Handbook (FSH) 2709.11_Special
Uses Handbook. On June 1, 1989, at 54 FR 23499, the Forest Service gave notice that the direction in FSM 2340 and 2720
was to be revised, that the remaining portions of the policy were designated as interim policy in compliance with the
Assistant Secretary's decision, and removed those provisions stayed by the Assistant Secretary.

On September 20, 1989, in response to the Assistant Secretary's decision, the Forest Service gave notice that it was
seeking comments on an Advance Notice of Proposed Policy (54 FR 38700). A 60-day comment period was provided which
was extended an additional 60 days, expiring on January 19, 1990. In this notice, the agency offered alternative approaches
to those portions of the policy stayed by the Assistant Secretary's decision and asked for public advice and comment
on those provisions and on the options that the agency identified to replace the current policy provisions.

The public comment received on the September 20, 1989, notice was considered in the development of a proposed reformulated
policy published on October 10, 1991 (56 FR 51260). A 90-day comment period was provided for this notice which was extended
an additional 60 days to March 9, 1992. This proposed policy also provided appropriate clarifying and explanatory
material for those parts of the 1988 policy shown as areas of concern in the Assistant Secretary's decision.



Analysis and Response to Public Comments



The Forest Service received 7,793 comments on the October 10, 1991, notice of proposed policy. The analysis of the
public comments was accomplished using standard Forest Service procedures designed to ensure an objective and systematic
analysis. Information was tabulated electronically. The number and percentage of responses by category of respondents
(as identified by the respondent) is as follows:






Comments were received from 45 States, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Over 50 percent of the responses came
from California which contains about 40 percent of all recreation residences. There were 312 comments received after
the closing date of the notice and not considered in the analysis of comments.

Respondents comments were sorted according to the proposed policy provisions identified in the comment. They were
further identified as: (1) Agreeing with the provision, (2) agreeing with the provision but with a contingency (comment),
(3) disagreeing with the provision, and (4) disagreeing with the provision but with a contingency.

Of the 7,793 responses received, 6,264 (80 percent) were in the form of questionnaires developed and distributed
by 2 national permittee associations. The questionnaires presented several general statements describing a premise
or belief of what the content of the revised policy should be to which the respondent could either agree or disagree.
For example, question 1 of the National Forest Homeowners questionnaire stated ``I strongly support the policy provision
that says recreation residences are a valid and important recreation use, and that it is Forest Service policy to continue
them. Please leave this provision unchanged.'' The fourth question of the National Inholders Association questionnaire
stated ``Removal of recreation residences will cause emotional pain and disruption for forest permittees and their
families. It will cause waste of resources. For that reason, the proposed policy of allowing removal of existing recreation
residences where there is no higher use (FSM 2721.23e) is arbitrary and wasteful.'' The questionnaire responses
were analyzed and the general views of the respondents considered during preparation of this final revised policy.
These views were helpful in identifying issues of concern to permittees.

Narrative comments were attached to 704 questionnaires. In addition, 1,529 letters containing comments on specific
provisions of the proposed policy were received. The total of 2,233 narrative responses, several of which provided
very detailed analysis and recommendations on policy provisions, provided the most useful information in preparing
the final revised policy and form the basis for the following comment analysis.

In addition to providing the questionnaire response forms to their members, the permittee associations provided
narrative responses to the proposed policy. These were generally detailed analysis of the policy with the associations'
recommendations for revision and improvement.

A summary of the general comments received and the agency's response to them is presented first, followed by a summary
of the specific comments received and the agency's response. Specific comments are organized in the same format as
found in the supplementary information to the proposed policy notice, that is, the same 7 topic headings representing
the major issues addressed in the proposed policy are used. The comment analysis concludes with a discussion of the
matters of concern in the Assistant Secretary's decision and the agency's response.



General Comments



Over half of the 2,233 respondents provided general comments on recreation residence use which were not directed
at specific provisions of the policy. Many respondents affirmed their desire to keep their cabins, at the same location,
at reasonable cost, and without continuous fear of nonrenewal of their permits. These respondents felt the agency,
through the proposed policy, was abandoning support for the recreation residence program, was biased against permit
holders, and was seeking to remove this use from National Forest System lands. Some respondents, however, felt the
agency was biased in favor of permit holders.

Many respondents offered eloquent testimony to the significance of the cabin to their family, citing emotional ties
to the site that span several generations. Others emphasized the importance of the recreation residence use to the
National Forest, describing how the cabins are used by a large segment of the public for recreation, generate income
to the Treasury, and contribute to the stewardship of the National Forests.

One permittee association advocated expansion of existing recreation residence tracts and establishment of new
tracts. This view was based on the belief that the agency was in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to
make recreation residence lots available to persons of minority races, or of diverse religious, political, and sexual
beliefs. On the other hand, several respondents, favored no expansion to phasing out of all recreation residence
tracts.

Many respondents objected to the appeal of the August 10, 1988, policy and 270 suggested that the policy be restored
in its entirety. Often, these respondents stated that the proposed policy was biased and discriminatory against
cabin owners and was overly responsive to the views of those who opposed recreation residence use. A smaller number
felt the proposed policy was an improvement over the 1988 policy, but that there were several flaws in the 1988 policy
not addressed in the proposal, particularly that the bias in favor of permit holders, as identified in the appeal decision,
had not been corrected. Eleven respondents offering general comments generally agreed with the proposed policy,
that it responded to the appeal decision, was constructive and a step in the right direction.

The Forest Service recognizes that there is a divergency of opinion on recreation residence use on the National Forests.
It is sympathetic to those who have enjoyed the privilege of the use for many years and who want to continue the privilege.
Further, the contributions these holders make to the management and protection of the National Forests is acknowledged.

The agency also recognizes that increasing demands are being placed on the National Forests to meet a wider array of
public uses. Significant new public laws have been enacted since the act authorizing privately owned recreation
residences on the National Forests was enacted in 1915. These laws, particularly the National Environmental Policy
Act and the National Forest Management Act of 1976, directly impact the way the agency manages public and private uses
of the National Forests. Equally significant, public perceptions of how the National Forests should be managed have
changed in the 75 years the recreation residence program has been in existence.

The agency, by policy adopted over 25 years ago, stopped the establishment of new recreation residence tracts. Subsequently,
it stopped issuing new permits for vacant lots in already established tracts. This has fixed the number of recreation
residences in existence to a current 15,600. This action was taken in response to an increasing public demand for recreation
use on the National Forests in the 1960's. The rationale supporting that policy decision still applies. The agency,
while recognizing the views of those respondents who seek to create new recreation residence opportunities, believes
that such action would not be in the public interest. It does not propose to create tracts nor offer new permits for recreation
residence use. Recreation residences are bought and sold in the private real estate market, and, as such, are available
to all individuals under the laws of the States and local governments in which they are located.

The Forest Service, in responding to the administrative appeal decision, seeks a permit review and issuance process
that does not show bias in favor of the recreation residence use, nor an intent by policy to remove the permitted use.

Readers are reminded that whether recreation residence use should continue to be permitted on National Forest System
lands is not the issue addressed in this final policy. The Assistant Secretary's appeal decision did not challenge
the appropriateness or continuation of the use. Rather, it focussed on legal flaws identified in the 1988 policy and
in the process by which that policy was adopted. This final policy responds solely to the specific provisions in the
appeal decision. The agency has not revised, redirected, or otherwise changed the national guidance stated in the
1988 policy and which was not debated in the appeal decision.

Several respondents offered editing suggestions on the proposed policy. For example, the words ``lot'' and ``site''
were used interchangeably in describing the holder's permitted area. The agency agrees that use of a single term improves
clarity and has used the word ``lot'' throughout the final policy. Also, the words ``permittee'' and ``holder'' were
both used to identify the party holding the permit for the recreation residence lot. Holder is the correct term and
is used throughout the final policy.

The use of terms ``termination'' and ``revocation'' in this policy, when describing the action leading to cessation
of the privileges granted by the permit, have caused confusion among holders and agency field personnel alike. A recent
amendment to the Manual (FSM 2705) clarified these terms and made their use consistent with regulations at 36 CFR 251.
This action requires a conforming revision to the recreation residence policy. In most cases, the term ``revocation''
replaces the term ``termination.'' To aid readers in understanding use of these terms in the final policy, they are
defined as follows:




Revocation: The cessation of a special use authorization by action of the authorized officer prior to the end of the
specified period of occupancy or use due to the holder's noncompliance with the terms of the authorization, failure
to exercise the privileges granted, or for reasons that are in the interest of the general public. Revocations are
appealable by the holder.

Termination: The cessation of a special use authorization by operation of law or the occurrence of a fixed or agreed-upon
condition, event or time without the necessity for any decision or action by the authorized officer.




Several other editing suggestions are incorporated into the final policy.

Finally, many respondents offered comments on provisions of the policy that were not addressed in the Assistant Secretary's
appeal decision. For example, several respondents objected to the provision in the permit which requires holders
to ``inspect the lot and adjoining areas for dangerous trees, hanging limbs, and other evidence of hazardous conditions
which could affect the improvements and or pose a risk of injury to individuals.'' (Permit provision IV.G) This provision
was in the permit adopted as part of the August 10, 1988, policy. As such, it was not considered in this revision of that
policy. The agency appreciates receiving these comments. They are an indication of holder concerns and will be considered
as the policy is updated and kept current.



Specific Comments and Response



The October 10, 1991, 

Federal Register

 notice requested public comments on a proposed revision to the recreation residence policy. The material in that
notice was arranged in 7 discussion topics that grouped the revisions into elements or segments of the four agency
directives that bear on recreation residences. These 7 discussion topics are also used in this notice. However, the
entire recreation residence policy is presented in this notice so that readers can see the revisions in the context
of the complete direction.

Many of the respondents offering specific comments also asked that key provisions and phrases from one part of the
policy be added to provisions elsewhere in the policy to lend emphasis or clarity to the provision. The Forest Service
advises that the redundancy occurring as a result of this would be inconsistent with agency directive system policy.
Readers are also advised that Forest Service direction for administering recreation residence permits, or any other
type of special use authorization, does not stand alone in the agency's administrative manual or handbooks. The direction
in this notice is dependent on overall direction affecting the entire special use program which appears in Federal
Regulations at 36 CFR part 251, subpart B, and titles 2300 and 2700 of the Manual. In addition, other direction affecting
the management of the National Forest System bears upon the recreation residence policy. In particular, direction
dealing with planning for all land and resource management activity and related direction dealing with environmental
analysis and compliance with the National Environmental Policy (NEPA), found at FSM 1920, and FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15,
respectively, greatly influences the direction contained in this notice. The agency has added cross-references
where appropriate when a specific policy provision is guided by broader policy direction.

1. Validity of the Recreation Residence Use

. The proposed direction at FSM 2347.1 set forth the basic policy on recreation residence use and continuance. The
beginning paragraph of that section established that recreation residences were a valid use of National Forest System
land and an important component of the overall National Forest recreation program. A clear statement of policy followed
stating that the use could continue to occupy the Federal lands. The purpose of this revision was to place the recreation
residence use on an equal footing with other uses when decisions involving allocation of the land were being made.


Comments.

 There were 738 comments received on this proposed policy. Most supported the policy statement and suggested it be
strengthened. For example, several respondents suggested the following language: ``Therefore, when considering
nonrenewal of recreation residence permits for an alternative use be sure that the value of the alternative public
use is equal to, or exceeds the value of the existing recreation use.'' Other respondents opposed the provision, stating
that it overstated the importance of the use and that such words as ``important'' implied that other uses were not important.
It was suggested that the word ``equally'' be placed before the words ``valid'' and ``important'' to provide better
balance to the policy statement.


Response.

 The Forest Service believes that recreation residences are a valid and important use of the National Forests. Equally,
it believes that existing uses should be allowed to continue. The agency recognizes that there may be rare instances
when a use is not consistent with a National Forest's Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan), and the recreation
residence use must give way to an alternative public use. However, the overall policy stated in this section is appropriate
to ensure that any decision to not allow a new permit for an established use to be issued must be fair and equitable and
supported by careful analysis and documentation. The Forest Service is satisfied that the policy statement in FSM
2347.1 adequately establishes the appropriateness of the recreation residence use without the need for further
clarification and will adopt the language as proposed.


2. Conformity to the 1915 Term Permit Act.

 This topic is confined to one provision of the proposed policy. Proposed paragraph 2 of FSM 2347.03 stated: ``Ensure
that recreation residence use does not preclude the general public from full enjoyment of the natural, scenic, recreational,
and other aspects of the National Forests as stipulated in the Act of March 4, 1915 (FSM 2701).'' This provision was
placed in the proposed policy to emphasize this requirement of the 1915 Act and uses words from the Act. This provision
was worded similarly in the 1988 policy but placed in a different location. The provision was moved into the policy
section in the 1991 proposal to give greater emphasis to the direction and thereby respond to the appeal decision's
direction to make the policy neutral.


Comment.

 There were 996 comments addressed to this provision of the proposed policy. The word ``ensure'' was the focus of nearly
all of the comments. Respondents felt that use of this word, conveying certainty of action, changed the intent of the
1915 Act language and would lead Forest officers, upon determining any impact on ``full enjoyment,'' to conclude
that the permitted use should not continue. (It should be noted that ``ensure'' was used in the provision in the 1988
policy.) Some respondents pointed out that it would be impossible for a Forest officer to ensure compliance with the
Act. Other respondents stated that the provision in the 1915 Act was not intended to discourage continuation of the
use. They pointed out that the Act does not establish priority of use (recreation residence versus other public uses),
thus an equality, not an hierarchy, of use is implied.


Response.

 The Forest Service agrees that the word ``ensure'' is inappropriate in this provision and that equality in the consideration
of uses is required. Further, the agency finds that the location of a provision in FSM 2347.03 dealing only with recreation
residences is not correct. The subject of Manual section 2347 is ``Non-commercial Recreation Use,'' a broad category
encompassing privately built and owned structures of which recreation residences are but one. Also included in this
category of use are private clubs and lodges, houseboats, boat docks and wharves, and shelters. All of these non-commercial
uses come under the guidance of the 1915 Act. The agency believes the guidance is appropriate but must be revised to
reflect the broader scope of the FSM section. Therefore, the provision is retained but renumbered as paragraph 3 to
reflect a more logical sequence of direction. The provision has been rewritten to remove ``ensure'' and to substitute
``non-commercial recreation sites'' for ``recreation residences.'' The reference to the 1915 Act is also removed
to avoid redundancy, as this Act is cited in the list of authorities under which term special use authorizations can
be granted (FSM 2701).


3. Determination of Permit Renewal and Nonrenewal. 

The provisions of the proposed policy dealing with continuation of the recreation residence use, conversion to alternative
public uses, and the analysis and decision-making process involved in these actions brought forth the largest number
and most detailed comments. There were over 1,900 comments directed to these policy provisions, many of which were
very detailed, and offered lengthy revisions to the proposed policy. This is to be expected as these provisions are
at the core of the appeal decision and are central to the holders' concern that they will be able to continue the use.
For ease of analysis, the discussion is separated into the four parts of the proposed policy that cover this topic.

a. Recreation Residence Continuance. The applicable direction is found at FSM 2347.03 and 2721.23e. The broad direction
on continuation of the recreation residence use (paragraph 3, FSM 2347.03 of the proposed policy) stated: ``Continue
to authorize those existing facilities now occupying National Forest land under special use authorization that
(a) are consistent with management direction given in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan, (b) are at locations
where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established, (c) do not constitute a material, uncorrectable
offsite hazard to National Forest resources, and (d) do not endanger the health or safety of the holder or the public.''
The proposed policy's guidance on the decision to reissue the permit is found at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1 as follows:
``The Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan) provides direction for continuance of the recreation residence
use (FSM 1920). As Forest plans are revised, recreation residence use shall be explicitly addressed in the plan through
delineation of management areas and associated management area prescriptions (FSM 1920).''



Comment.

 There were 136 comments received on these two provisions of the proposed policy. The use of the Forest plan as the means
of determining recreation residence continuance is the most significant departure the proposed policy makes from
the 1988 policy. Most of the respondents were suspicious of this change, stating their concern about inconsistent
or arbitrary local treatment of the residences, inability to participate in the decision-making process involving
Forest plans, and the failure to use environmental analysis standards when amending or revising Forest plans.

Respondents felt that the decision process on continuance was flawed because continuance was determined by whether
the use was consistent with the Forest plan. They advocated a return to the process described in the 1988 policy which
stated the decision to continue the use was to be made by a separate, free-standing analysis that did not depend on the
language of the Forest plan. In the proposed policy, the consistency determination in the context of recreation residences
would be made on the basis of a comparison to the land and resource allocations made in the Forest plan. If land allocated
to the recreation residence use was consistent, the use could continue. If not consistent, the use would be analyzed
to determine if it could be made consistent or must be removed in favor of the proposed action, or alternative public
use.

Other respondents described the policy provision allowing continuance of those existing facilities which ``. . .
are at locations where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established'' as a ``Pandora's box,''
since there are always alternative purposes. They were concerned that the direction provided no guidelines or criteria
for use in weighing alternative uses of National Forest land and thus would allow decisions which were arbitrary and
capricious. The respondents asked for a definition of alternative public purpose.

Others opposed these provisions because they believed use of the phrase ``continue to'' biased the decision to offer
a new permit.

Finally, respondents felt that the determination of whether the use should continue based on a policy promulgated
by the agency's Washington Office could result in arbitrary action by individuals removed from the issue as it should
be addressed. They suggested instead that each location should be viewed on its own and not be part of a nationwide policy.
Conversely, some respondents felt the proposed policy left too much up to the whims of local forest officials where
decisions could be made arbitrarily and capriciously without regard to national policy.



Response

. The proposed policy significantly changed the 1988 policy's direction in the way recreation residence continuance
decisions would be made. Making the Forest plan the foundation for the decision to continue the use is a major departure
from the ``analysis of continuance'' process set forth in 1988 policy. Most permit holders are not familiar with the
forest planning process that produces the individual National Forest Land and Resource Management plan. In fact,
many indicated they were unaware that a plan encompassing all activities on the National Forest existed. Those that
were aware of the planning process often did not make the link between their permitted use and the broad guidance set
forth in the plan.

The agency recognizes the significance of this departure from previous policy. However, it must be guided by statutory
authority and its own implementing direction. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the agency to use
an integrated, interdisciplinary forest planning process to make the land and resource allocation decisions for
each National Forest. Further, section 6 of the 1976 Act requires that all permits, contracts, and other instruments
for the use and occupancy of National Forest System lands shall be consistent with the Forest plan. Thus, recreation
residence use and continuance must be brought into compliance with that direction.

Respondents' concerns that use of the Forest plan to guide permit continuance decisions or determining alternative
public purposes reflects the lack of understanding of the planning process. The planning policy sets forth clear
direction to involve all affected parties and the public when amending or revising a Forest plan. These requirements
are emphasized in the proposed recreation residence policy which requires notification and involvement of holders
and their representatives (FSM 2721.23h, paragraph 2). The agency believes that requirements that holders be involved
in all actions affecting the recreation residence use are adequately covered in the policy and will not lead to inconsistent
or arbitrary treatment of the use during Forest planning.
Environmental analysis is the cornerstone upon which decisions by local agency officials rest. Agency policy on
environmental analysis at FSM 1950 and FSH 1909.15 is clear and detailed. Actions which affect the Forest plan, including
those which implement the plan must be supported by environmental documentation. Respondents concerns that the
recreation residence use will be adversely affected through a process that they are not informed of or involved in
must consider this policy in its entirety and recognize that long-established agency policy would not permit this
to happen.
Use of the term ``alternative public purpose'' in the proposed policy reflects the agency's recognition that the
Assistant Secretary's appeal decision required decisions on continuance to be made in a neutral manner. The holders'
desire for continued use cannot be considered superior to other public uses but must be judged in the context of the
overall use of the land. The word ``alternative'' is intended to convey the concept of equality of use instead of superiority
of one use over another. The agency recognizes that the recreation residence use must be considered equally when considering
allocation of land and resources through the Forest planning process. On the other hand, it does not, indeed, it cannot,
place the use at a higher level than other uses in the Forest planning process. It is the Forest planning process which
defines and limits alternative public uses through allocation of land and resources. Alternative public uses can
only be those which the Forest plan defines. Thus, the phrase is considered the most accurate way to portray the actions
involved in recreation residence continuance and will be retained in the final policy.
The agency rejects respondents' concerns that the term ``continue to'' in FSM 2347.03, paragraph 1, lends bias toward
renewal of the permit. The term is fully consistent with policy stating that the use is a valid use of National Forest
land. Further, it is limited by the language which follows in the provision.
The agency also rejects respondents' objections to policy promulgated at the national level which cannot adequately
address local conditions affecting the use, and, conversely, that such decisions should not be made by local officials.
The proposed policy balances national policy on recreation residence use with a planning and decision-making process
made at the individual National Forest level. This decentralized process is considered the most appropriate way
to manage these Federal lands.
Therefore, the agency will adopt the language of the proposed policy at FSM 2347.03, paragraph 3 (renumbered as paragraph
2 in the final policy), and FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1, pertaining to continuance of the use unless the use is at a location
where an alternative public purpose has been established through the Forest planning process. Paragraph 1, FSM 2721.23e,
has been edited for clarity and consistency with the forest planning process.
b. Use Consistent With Forest Plan. The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 2, provided guidance when making
decisions on continuance of the use. It stated: ``Decisions to issue new recreation residence term permits following
expiration of the current term permit require a determination of consistency with the current Forest plan. Make this
determination by evaluating the extent to which continued recreation residence use adheres to the standards and
guidelines contained in the management prescription for the appropriate management area. Address continuation
of recreation residence use on a tract or group of tracts basis, not on individual sites.'' Subparagraph a then sets
forth direction when recreation residence use was consistent with the current Forest plan. When the use was consistent
with the plan, the use would continue, a new permit issued, and the decision to issue categorically excluded from environmental
documentation, unless ``extraordinary circumstances'' were present that would merit analysis of environmental
effects. The procedural direction in FSH 41.23a provided detailed instructions on issuing new permits when the use
was consistent with the Forest plan.





Note: 

The 1991 proposed policy advised that the agency was currently revising its policies and procedures for complying
with NEPA and that the adoption of final NEPA policy could affect the direction contained in the proposed policy relating
to environmental analysis and documentation. The final NEPA policy was adopted on September 18, 1992 (57 FR 43180),
and does affect this proposed policy.



Changes in the recreation residence policy made necessary by the final NEPA policy are noted in the following discussion.


Comment. 

There were 771 comments directed to this provision that gives guidance where recreation residence use is consistent
with the Forest plan. While respondents favored the expedited process in issuing a new permit, nearly all stated some
degree of opposition to the direction. Comments focused on the requirements for environmental analysis as the basis
for a decision to continue the use, particularly the requirements relating to ``extraordinary circumstances.''
Respondents felt that recreation residences, having been in place for many years, do not cause significant environmental
effects and the decision to issue a new permit should be categorically excluded from environmental documentation.
Respondents also suggested that requiring environmental analysis was unnecessary, redundant, and costly. They
suggested that the requirement be severely limited and each decision to prepare environmental documentation be
reviewed by superior officials before being implemented.
Respondents expressed concern that extraordinary circumstances, described in the notice as including the presence
of threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat, flood plains, wetlands, archaeological sites, or
historic properties or areas, were present in nearly every recreation residence tract, and thus would always trigger
further environmental analysis even though the recreation residence has existed within such circumstances and
without causing adverse impacts. Respondents pointed out that the fact the use was consistent with the Forest plan
would be rendered meaningless because all uses would be subjected to an environmental analysis or environmental
impact statement before a new permit could be issued. They felt that this requirement was too open-ended and discretionary
and would allow generalities, such as open space, visual corridors, or general forest areas to be defined as extraordinary
circumstances. They recommended that the presence of an assumed extraordinary circumstance should not in itself
preclude continuation of the use, or create a presumption of inconsistency with the Forest plan, until analysis proves
the circumstance to be truly extraordinary and continued recreation residence use a threat to the environment. One
respondent suggested that extraordinary circumstances be limited to those which are new and did not exist in the period
shortly before the time when a decision on continuance is to be made, and that the presence of endangered species, for
example, in the area of recreation residences should not automatically trigger the preparation of an environmental
analysis or impact statement.

The direction in FSH 2709.11, section 41.23a, providing procedural direction on continuing the use and issuing a
new permit, brought forth comments cautioning against ``useless and unnecessary EA or EIS studies.'' These respondents
suggested that extraordinary circumstances should not automatically require preparation of environmental analyses.
Other respondents suggested that the entire section 41.23a be removed since the guidance prejudges, skews and appears
to bias the process.



Response.

 The Forest Service agrees the proposed policy and procedures applicable when recreation residence use is consistent
with the Forest plan is unnecessarily complex. It also agrees that situations under which extraordinary circumstances
would apply to permit continuation are too broad and need refinement. When use is consistent, the policy should provide
an expedited process resulting in a new permit. The Forest plan is the means by which environmentally sensitive areas
are identified and managed. The presence of extraordinary circumstances should not force additional environmental
documentation unless it is clearly established that a material adverse environmental effect could result by continuing
the use.

Accordingly, the agency has substantially revised the proposed policy at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 2, and FSH 2709.11,
section 41.23a. This revision recognizes the public comments and the final revised NEPA policy and procedures adopted
by the agency in 1992. The NEPA policy substantially clarified previous policy for excluding actions from environmental
documentation. Further, the agency has chosen to minimize its direction on environmental documentation in the final
policy and guidance and instead refers to the NEPA policy found in FSH 1909.15.

Briefly, recreation residence uses that are consistent with the Forest plan will, upon expiration of the current
term permit, be issued a new term permit. The environmental documentation supporting the Forest plan will, in most
cases, be sufficient for documenting the decision to continue the recreation residence use.

When issuing new permits, a record of decision or decision notice and finding of no significant impact would be prepared
only if the recreation residence use was not specifically approved in the Forest plan decision document. Issuance
of a new permit is an implementation action of a Forest plan decision approving recreation residence use. The NEPA
compliance requirement is fulfilled by the Forest plan environmental impact statement. Recreation residence use
which has changed since being found consistent with the Forest plan would require further NEPA analysis and documentation.
In most cases this analysis would cause the action to fall within a category of actions excluded from NEPA documentation.

An exception to the above may occur if the environmental documentation supporting the decision to continue the recreation
residence use is more than 5 years old at the time of permit expiration. This requirement is set forth in the agency's
Environmental Policy and Procedures Handbook (FSH 1909.15, sec. 18.03) and is based on the Council on Environmental
Quality's ``Forty Questions'' document.

The action necessary to issue the new term permit would commence two years before permit expiration and the holder
notified of the action. New permits that continue the use would contain updated clauses that reflect current Department
of Agriculture regulations and other Federal, State, or county laws applicable to the area covered by the permit.

Therefore, the agency is adopting final policy as described above. This is set forth at FSM 2721.23e, paragraph 1.

c. Use Not Consistent With the Forest Plan_Project Analysis. The proposed policy at FSM 2721,23e, paragraph 2b, provided
direction on action to be taken when the recreation residence use was not consistent with the Forest plan. Procedural
guidance at FSH 41.23b described the procedure to follow in conducting a project analysis. The recreation residence
use would be inconsistent when the lands currently authorized for recreation residence use are allocated to other
public uses by the Forest plan. Continued recreation residence use would thus be inconsistent with new management
prescriptions, standards and guidelines. This could occur when a Forest plan defines a management area of the National
Forest for developed recreation use and an amendment to the plan changes this to threatened or endangered species
habitat. The recreation residence use would then apparently be inconsistent with the new management area designation.
In this case, a ``project analysis'' would be prepared to determine whether the use could be accommodated along with
the alternative public use, or must be removed upon permit expiration.

The project analysis would identify a range of public uses consistent with the Forest plan direction, including consideration
of continuing the recreation residence use, that would be compatible with the management area designation. If this
analysis indicates the recreation residence use could continue, a decision would be made to issue a new permit upon
expiration of the current permit. Since continuation of the use had been determined to be inconsistent with the Forest
plan, the plan would have to be amended to accommodate the changed determination. If the analysis indicates that the
use cannot continue, the holder would be notified that a new permit will not be issued upon expiration of the current
permit. In this event, the holder would receive at least 10 years of continued occupancy from the date of notification
and may be offered an alternative location, or in-lieu lot, for the use.

Comment: 

There were 998 comments received on this provision of the proposed policy. Many respondents were concerned that use
of the Forest plan to determine whether the recreation residence use should continue was inappropriate because the
plan could never focus on the specific and different issues that a proper analysis of the use demands. Others felt that
in reality the decision on recreation residences would be made in the plan and that the project analysis would only
serve to verify that decision. They felt that the phrase in the provision ``implement the new direction'' implied
that a decision had already been made. They recommended this provision be eliminated since it assumes an inconsistency
prior to a finding. Instead, they recommended that new management direction be ``reviewed'' to emphasize that the
project analysis was not a sham.

Nearly all of the respondents commenting on this provision of the proposed policy stated that the proper sequence
of planning should have the project analysis prepared before the Forest plan is amended or revised and be the basis
for the amendment or revision. This concern is the basis for respondents' recommendation that a determination of
inconsistency be made only on the basis of a self-contained, site specific project analysis that follows all environmental
analysis requirements. Respondents also expressed misgivings that the process called for in the provision conveyed
a bias against the use. 

These concerns can be summarized by the comment of one respondent: ``The 1988 policy required a specific environmental
analysis for any decisions pertaining to `inconsistency' with the Forest plan. In the draft policy inconsistency
is now decided within the Forest plan WITHOUT ANY EFFECTIVE RULES. This is just not reasonable and is unfair.''

Several respondents expressed concern that recreation residence permit holders would not be involved in the actions
leading to adoption of Forest plan amendments, or that their participation would not be sought until the basic decisions
on land use had been made. They asked that permit holders be a part of the entire process.

Comments on the procedural guidance in FSH 41.23b for completing project analyses focused on the addition of or emphasis
on the factors and considerations to be included in the analysis. Several suggested recognition of environmental,
economic and social costs of removing the recreation residences. Others recommended that cost/benefit analysis
of removal be included in the analysis. Several respondents suggested that the standards and guidelines for the project
analysis were substantially weaker in the proposed policy than those in the 1988 policy and recommended that the earlier
language be restored so that there was consistency between all National Forests. Many suggestions were received
that could be used to edit and clarify the proposed guidance in FSH 41.23b.



Response: 

The respondents to this section of the proposed policy did so under a distinct disadvantage. The proposed policy describing
Forest planning, NEPA analysis, and public involvement processes affecting the recreation residence use was based
on more complete, overall guidance set forth elsewhere in the Manual and Handbooks. The proposed direction for this
specific use, therefore, was supplemental to that overall guidance. Respondents were not aware of or did not have
access to this overall guidance. They sought to resolve their concerns or objections by recommending more complete
descriptions of the processes or clarification of procedures relating to recreation residence continuance. Thus,
many of the comments summarized above could be responded to by simply stating that the concern is thoroughly treated
elsewhere in FSM or FSH.

The agency is sympathetic to the respondents' dilemma. However, it disputes the contention that actions affecting
recreation residences during forest planning occur without any effective rules to guide them. The rules (direction)
are clear and thorough. The agency's dilemma is that its directives policy prohibits repetition and redundancy in
manual and handbook material for the sake of emphasis or clarity. Direction guiding the forest planning process is
found in FSM 1920.

To resolve this dilemma, the agency has placed references at appropriate places in the final policy so that local agency
officials and holders are aware of overall direction that influences the specific direction on recreation residence
use. And, the agency believes that respondents' concerns about forest planning, consistency determinations, and
applicability of NEPA, will be resolved as holders become more knowledgeable about the forest planning and environmental
analysis processes. Most respondents acknowledged that the recreation residence use should be recognized in the
Forest plan. Likewise, holders should recognize that it is in their interest to be involved in the forest planning
process, not only to protect their interests in their recreation residences, but to demonstrate that they are part
of the National Forest community and interested in its overall management. The Forest Service believes this final
policy will encourage holder participation in the forest planning process.

Agency policy on forest planning and NEPA evaluation does not allow a decision to remove recreation residences to
be made by the Forest plan. The process for implementing a Forest plan, explained in FSH 1902.12, requires that any
use that appears to be inconsistent with new management direction must be analyzed and evaluated before any decision
is made to discontinue that use. In section 2721.23e, paragraph 1b, of the final policy, the agency has clarified this
point by revising the heading to read ``Use Apparently Not Consistent With the Forest Plan.'' This revision is intended
to reinforce the point that an inconsistency determination does not result in removal of the use, only that such action
is possible. A decision on removal of the use cannot be made until a project analysis is completed. 

Project analysis should not precede forest planning. The overall direction contained in a Forest plan is the foundation
upon which all land and resource activities of the National Forest are based. The Forest plan promotes more integrated
consideration of all land and resource management activities. The direction in the proposed policy providing for
project analysis following implementation of the Forest plan and identification of apparent inconsistency remains
unchanged in the final policy. 

Respondents' concerns that permit holders would not be involved in Forest planning is unfounded. Overall direction
in FSM 1950, FSH 1909.15, and 36 CFR Part 216 requires local Forest Service officials to seek the views of the public,
including holders of authorizations to use National Forest land. Further, the direction in the proposed policy at
FSM 2721.23h and FSH 2709.11, section 41.23b, paragraph 1 would require local officials to involve permit holders
in activities involving Forest plan amendments and revisions, implementation of plans, and project analyses. The
agency believes this direction is adequate to ensure holders' awareness of any action affecting their use. Thus,
the proposed policy in this regard remains unchanged in the final policy. 

The guidance in section 41.23b has been selectively revised to recognize the suggestions of several respondents.
The first sentence of the section has been rewritten to reflect that Forest plan amendment or revision does not necessarily
make the recreation residence use inconsistent with new management direction. Rather, it reflects that continued
use under the new management direction is uncertain and a site specific project analysis is required to verify the
inconsistency. Paragraph 2 of this section of the proposed policy, titled ``Analysis Documentation'' and describing
the content of the project analysis report and NEPA documentation, is revised in the final policy to require information
on applicable resource conditions to be included in the report. Paragraph 3a(4), requiring a comparison of benefits
and disadvantages of the proposed alternative public use and the recreation residence use, has been revised in the
final policy to include consideration of the cost of removing the recreation residence. 

Paragraph 4 of FSH 41.23b of the proposed policy, describing the project analysis decision and documentation, has
been extensively revised to clarify the process by which a decision is reached. Three possible decisions are outlined:
(1) If the project analysis results in a decision to amend the Forest plan such that continued use will not be inconsistent
with the proposed alternative use, a new term permit would be issued upon permit expiration; (2) if the project analysis
results in a decision to amend the Forest plan such that the recreation residence use is in some degree inconsistent
with the proposed alternative use but does not conflict with it, or the proposed alternative use can accommodate some
or all of the recreation residence use, appropriate modifications would be made to the current permit and new term
permits for the applicable lots would be issued; or (3) if the project analysis results in a decision that the recreation
residence use remains inconsistent with the Forest plan and cannot be accommodated with the proposed alternative
use, a decision would be made that the recreation residences are to be removed. This revision adds a third possibility
to the project analysis decision where the use is in apparent conflict but can be accommodated with the proposed use.


Paragraph 5 of FSH 41.23b, titled ``Decision Notification,'' presents the requirements to be followed in notifying
holders and other interested parties of the project analysis decision. Two items are added to those listed in the proposed
policy: (1) Notification of whether in-lieu lots will or will not be made available, and (2) notification that annual
fees will be adjusted during the final 10 years of use. The remainder of the paragraph has been edited for clarity. 

d. Project Analysis Decision Review. The proposed policy at 2721.23e, paragraph 2c required the authorized officer
to review a project analysis decision two years prior to permit expiration, if that decision was more than five years
old. Handbook guidance at 41.23b, paragraph 6, described the procedure by which the project decision would be reviewed.
The review would determine if changes in resource conditions required reconsideration of the decision. Holders
and interested publics would be notified of the review. If the review indicated no change in resource conditions,
the original decision would be implemented. If conditions had changed, a new project analysis would be made to determine
use of the lot. A project analysis decision review would not be appealable. 



Comment

. Few respondents commented on this provision although a similar provision at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 11, raised
a concern among several respondents that the holder would not have an opportunity to be heard in this review. 



Response

. The project analysis decision review is intended to ensure that the actions which resulted in the decision remain
applicable when the permit is about to expire since 8 to 10 years would have elapsed since the decision was made. This
could prevent removal of a recreation residence when there is no longer a need for the alternative public use. The agency
intends that the review be undertaken with the full knowledge and participation of the holder. It emphasizes that
the direction in 2721.23e makes it clear that holder involvement in the review is required. The proposed policy is
considered to be fully adequate and is adopted as final policy. 

 e. Permit Decision Process (Diagram). The proposed policy, in Exhibit 01, section 41.23c, presented in diagrammatic
form the process described in section 41.23a and b by which a decision is reached to continue the recreation residence
use or convert the use to an alternative public use.

Comment: 

Eight respondents identified problems with the chart. They pointed out that the process shown when a project analysis
decision allows the recreation residence use to continue (even though it had been found to be inconsistent with the
Forest plan), does not agree with the text describing that process. The respondents suggested that when the use is
allowed to continue it should not be subject to further review and analysis. Instead, the use should be considered
as consistent with the Forest plan and the decision process should move directly to issuance of a new permit. In terms
of the diagram, the arrow from this box should move left to the line showing consistency with the Forest plan instead
of downward to the box showing decision review.



Response:

 The Forest Service agrees with these respondents and has revised the diagram accordingly. Readers should recognize,
however, that revisions in the direction and procedural guidance for continuance and removal of the use, discussed
earlier in this notice, have also required revisions to the chart. The diagram appears in the final policy as section
41.23c.



4. Permit Issuance and Term.

 The proposed policy at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 3, and at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 9, stated that permits for recreation
residence use would be issued for a maximum of 20 years. Paragraph 10 of FSM 2721.23a provided direction for permit
issuance following a decision to convert the lot to an alternative public use. In this event, the current term permit
would be allowed to expire and a new term permit issued for up to 10 years to satisfy any additional time because of the
10-year notification requirement.



Comment:

 There were 224 responses to these permit issuance and term provisions. Most respondents supported the 20-year term
for recreation residence use, and the 10-year notification in case of conversion to an alternative public use. A few
respondents preferred 30-year permits. Others objected to the 10-year notification with continued occupancy provision
and the granting of additional time beyond the originally authorized term to satisfy notification requirements,
stating that the holder accepted the original term and provisions, and should not receive these favorable considerations.



Response:

 The Term Permit Act of March 4, 1915, authorizes terms up to 30 years. The Forest Service's long-standing policy has
been to issue permits for 20-year terms, and if the use is to be terminated, the additional 10 years granted will keep
the total length of the permit within the statutory limit. Also, specifying a maximum term of 20 years provides local
agency officials flexibility in establishing length of terms to accommodate local needs. For example, if the official
wished to have all permits on an administrative unit expire in the same year for efficiency in administration, a term
of 18 years may be needed to match terms of permits issued earlier. The agency does not agree to elimination of the 10-year
notification requirement or the provision providing additional occupancy when the use is to be removed. The investment
in the recreation residence and the length most have been in existence make the agency's policy on notification and
tenure fair and equitable. Readers are reminded that the agency does not pay a permittee for the value of the improvements
when a permit expires under its own terms and must be removed. The agency is satisfied that a 20-year term for recreation
residence term permits is appropriate and will adopt this provision in the final policy. However, to clarify that
shorter terms may be dictated because of permit expiration and conversion of the lot to another public purpose, the
provision is modified to reflect this exception to the 20-year term. This direction ensures compliance with the Assistant
Secretary's appeal decision concerning indefinite tenure. This revised policy is also consistent with the final
policy provisions requiring that decisions on continuance or removal of the use be based on the direction in the individual
National Forest plan.



5. Annual Fees in Event of Nonrenewal.

 The proposed policy at FSH 2709.11, section 33.2, responded to the appeal decision's direction to reconsider the
1988 policy's direction for determining fees when a holder is placed on notice that a new permit will not be issued;
that is, when the permit is placed on tenure. Three provisions in this section were examined in the proposed policy.
The opening paragraph of this section stated that fees would be reduced 10 percent yearly during the 10-year notification
period. This maintained the provision in the 1988 policy. The second provision (numbered paragraph 1) provided that
in the event the decision to remove the recreation residence was reversed and the holder was given a new 20-year term
permit, the Forest Service would recover all fees foregone while the permit was under notice it would not be renewed.
This changed the provision in the 1988 policy which provided that 50 percent of the fees would be recovered. The third
provision (numbered paragraph 2) provided that in the event of a reversed decision and a new permit was issued with
a term of less than 10 years, fees foregone would not be recovered, but the fee would be reduced by 10 percent for each
year the permit was under tenure notice (for example, fees for a 6-year tenure would be 60 percent of the full fee). This
maintained the policy set forth in the 1988 policy provision.



Comment:

 There were 84 comments on these provisions of the proposed policy. Most respondents asked that the 50 percent fee recovery
provision of the 1988 policy be reinstituted. They stated that the market value of the use is reduced when permits are
placed on tenure, and, as the agency is required by law to charge fees based on fair market value, the 50 percent recovery
is more than fair because the recovery amount should be zero. Others pointed out that the Forest Service's explanation
that no precedent could be found in the private market providing for 50 percent recovery and therefore requiring full
repayment of foregone fees was true because the private market would not recover foregone fees. On the other hand,
several respondents asked why a holder should be entitled to reduced fees since it is not common practice in the private
real estate market for a lessor to reduce rental fees when not renewing a lease, especially when the improvements must
be removed by the lessee. One respondent asked whether fees for permits under tenure were subject to the same annual
index adjustment as permits not under tenure.



Response:

 The agency decision in the 1988 policy to reduce fees when permits are placed on tenure was based on its understanding
of common practice in the private real estate market. Reexamination of this question in view of the appeal decision
does not provide information to contradict this earlier decision. The agency is not persuaded by respondents' statements
contradicting its understanding of the private market. Therefore, the provision to reduce fees 10 percent for each
year the permit is under tenure will be maintained in the final policy. (Section 33.2)

The agency based its decision to recover all fees foregone when a new 20-year permit is given for a use formerly under
tenure because it could not confirm this was a common practice in the private real estate market. It also received legal
advice that it had no authority to forgive fees foregone in this instance. Upon reexamination of this issue for preparation
of this final policy, it again was not able to confirm that not recovering fees foregone is standard practice in the
private market. Thus, the agency will keep this provision in the final policy. (Section 33.2, paragraph 1)

The agency is also maintaining the provision from the proposed policy that when holders with permits on tenure are
given new permits with terms of 10 years or less past fees foregone are not recovered and fees for the new term are reduced
10 percent a year. Holders who receive an additional period of use but do not get a full 20-year term permit do not have
the full value of the use and thus should not pay a full fee. This provision is adopted consistent with the provision
to reduce fees when permits are placed on tenure. The second sentence of this provision has been edited to clarify its
intent. (Section 33.2, paragraph 2)

Readers should note that the third paragraph in this section, describing action to be taken when holders with permits
on tenure are given new permits with terms of 10 to 20 years, was not revised in the proposed policy and remains identical
to the language in the 1988 policy. In this case, fees are to be recovered in full.

6. Offering of In-Lieu Lots.

 The appeal decision faulted language in the 1988 policy that made the offering of in-lieu lots mandatory to holders
who have received notification that a new permit would not be issued or whose permits have been terminated. (FSM 2347.1,6;
FSM 2721,23a,13; FSM 2721.23f; FSH 41.23c.)
As explained in the 1991 notice of proposed policy, the intent of the 1988 policy was to make the offering of in-lieu
lots discretionary. It was use of the word ``shall'' in one sentence of the policy that conveyed the impression that
offering of in-lieu lots was mandatory. In addition, however, the appeal decision expressed concern that making
in-lieu lots available to holders receiving notice that their use was to be terminated or that they would not receive
a new permit limited agency management discretion in determining use of National Forest land. Therefore, each of
the four provisions in the 1988 policy dealing with the offering of in-lieu lots was examined. As a result, the 4 provisions
dealing with in-lieu lots were revised in the proposed policy.
The overall policy on offering in-lieu lots to holders who had been notified that a new permit would not be issued or
whose permit was being terminated prior to expiration (except when the termination is for noncompliance) was stated
at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, of the proposed policy. This provision directed agency officials to determine the availability
of in-lieu lots for eligible holders. It described sites available for in-lieu lot purposes as those in nonconflicting
locations in established recreation residence tracts within the National Forest containing the recreation residences
to be removed or in established tracts in adjacent National Forests. Lots appropriate for in-lieu purposes were undeveloped
lots within or adjoining established recreation tracts not needed for other public purposes and lots formerly occupied
and now vacant. This provision also directed that new recreation residence tracts could not be established for in-lieu
lot purposes. This reversed the 1988 policy which stated new recreation residence tracts could be established for
this purpose.
Direction in FSM 2721.23a of the proposed policy, provided that in-lieu lots could be offered when a recreation residence
was destroyed or substantially damaged by flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement and the holder was not allowed
to rebuild. The 1988 policy stated that every reasonable effort should be made to offer in-lieu lots in this event.
The proposed policy in FSM 2721.23f, presented direction in cases of nonrenewal of permits and conversion of lots
to alternative public purpose. It stated the lots may be offered if available and not needed for alternative public
purposes. The 1988 policy provided that every reasonable effort should be made to offer the lots.
The guidance in FSH 41.23c of the proposed policy, gave detailed procedures on the offering of in-lieu lots. The offer
would be made when notice was given that a new permit would not be issued. If a lot became available within 12 months of
the notification it could be offered then. Priority was to be given to lots in the same recreation residence tract or
an expansion of that tract. Holders would be allowed 90 days to accept the offer of an in-lieu lot and upon acceptance
the lot would be reserved for that holder and a new permit issued. A fee would not be charged until construction of the
improvements began. The lot reservation would expire if the holder failed to occupy the in-lieu lot on agreed upon
schedule. Holders accepting offers could continue to use the current lot until the permit expired, but they should
be prepared to move to the new lot 24 months prior to permit expiration. If accepted by the previous owner, the offer
of an in-lieu lot would be extended to a new owner.
The proposed Handbook guidance differed in several respects from the 1988 policy. The proposed guidance limited
availability of lots to those becoming available to 12 months. Tracts could not be established specifically for in-lieu
lot purposes. Holders were to be given a new permit when the offer of an in-lieu lot was accepted, a new requirement.
Fees were to be charged when construction began rather than when improvement of the lot began, a clarification. Holders
were to be prepared to move within 24 months of permit expiration rather than when the current use was removed, also
a clarification.


Comment.

 There were 359 responses to the in-lieu lot provisions of the proposed policy. Several respondents felt that the Assistant
Secretary's appeal decision required only that the 1988 policy be changed to assure that the offering of in-lieu lots
was not mandatory. Respondents overwhelmingly objected to the changes made by the proposed policy from the 1988 policy.
Summarized, the respondents felt that the number of sites available for in-lieu lots available should be as large
as possible and should include authority to establish new tracts for this purpose. The general belief was that a weak
in-lieu lot program, when coupled with a policy of no new tracts for this purpose, would, through attrition, eventually
lead to removal of all or most recreation residences. A much smaller number of respondents maintained that the offering
of in-lieu lots should be discretionary and that no new tracts should be established for this purpose.
Respondents also objected to the removal of the phrase ``every reasonable effort'' when directing local officials
to provide in-lieu lots to terminated or nonrenewal permits. They felt that this subtle change in wording reversed
long-standing Forest Service policy to offer in-lieu lots in nonconflicting locations. They recommended that the
proposed policy be strengthened or the language of the 1988 policy be restored.

Another group of respondents felt that the proposed policy ignored the Assistant Secretary's appeal decision. They
felt that any lots available for in-lieu lots should be made available instead to the general public for recreation
residences. Their view was that the holder whose permit expires and is notified that a new permit will not be issued
acquires no more rights to available lots than any other member of the public and should not receive any preferential
treatment. Generally, this group of respondents felt the entire policy of offering of in-lieu lots should be deleted
but if retained should be limited strictly to lots available within existing recreation residence tracts.

Responses to the proposed policy provision on in-lieu lot availability following destruction of the improvements
by catastrophic event (FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 13) reflected a similar division of views as was found in the overall
policy. Some felt allowing a holder to rebuild the improvements or to receive an in-lieu lot extends the use indefinitely
and is contrary to the appeal decision. Others felt the proposed policy was not clear with regard to when rebuilding
the improvements would be ``consistent'' with Forest plan. Several suggestions were made to clarify this provision.
Many respondents commented on the inclusion of fire in the list of catastrophic events to which this provision applies.
This had been suggested in the September 1989 Advance Notice of Proposed Policy. Respondents overwhelmingly opposed
the listing of fire in this provision. They felt the risk of loss of the recreation residence from fire is inherent in
a forest setting and thus should not be cause for permit termination.

Respondents commenting on the proposed Handbook direction at FSH 41.23c pointed out what they believed was more restrictive
language than in the 1988 policy. Specifically, they cited the 12 month limit on offering an in-lieu lot, the 90-day
limit on holders acceptance of the lot offer, and the requirement that occupancy of the in-lieu lot begins when construction
begins.



Response. 

The Forest Service does not agree that the reformulation of the in-lieu lot provisions of the 1988 recreation residence
policy should be limited to the question of whether the offer is mandatory or discretionary. The appeal decision questioned
the policy on offering of in-lieu lots and directed that all provisions of the policy dealing with this issue be stayed
from implementation and reconsidered. The agency, in its September 1991 proposed policy, modified it to respond
to the appeal decision's concern that the use was being perpetuated when in-lieu lots were offered.

Under policy stated at FSM 2347.1, the agency affirms that recreation residences are a valid use of National Forest
System lands and an important component of the overall National Forest recreation program. It also acknowledges
that there may be circumstances, albeit very limited, where this use is not consistent with the overall management
direction for the land and the recreation residence use must be converted to an alternative public use. When these
circumstances occur, however, the agency believes that holders of these uses should not be subjected to the loss of
the use if reasonable options are available to accommodate the use elsewhere. Thus, it is maintaining its long-established
in-lieu lot provisions in the final policy.

The agency does recognize that certain provisions in the proposed policy limited the scope of the 1988 policy and has
reconsidered several provisions. In FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, the first sentence is revised to read ``Although provision
of an in-lieu lot is not required, make a reasonable effort to provide a lot to holders whose lots will be converted to
an alternative public use and have received notification that new permits for those lots will not be issued, or who
have received termination notices (except termination for noncompliance) (FSM 2721.23e).''


The agency is maintaining the provision in the proposed policy that prohibited establishment of new tracts for in-lieu
lot purposes. However, the agency points out that it is possible under the revised second sentence of this provision
to expand a recreation residence tract in order to relocate the use to accommodate a change in land use. Such could happen
when a river is designated as a Wild and Scenic River and recreation residences located a few feet from the riverbank
are moved several hundred feet back from the river to accommodate public use along the riverbank. The third sentence
of this provision is clarified to identify locations suitable for in-lieu lots to include undeveloped lands, and
formerly developed and withdrawn recreation residence lots in or adjacent to established recreation residence
tracts.

The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 13, describing action to be taken when a recreation residence is destroyed
or substantially damaged by catastrophic event, is revised to clarify when improvements could be rebuilt or the permit
terminated and in-lieu lot available.

The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23f affirmed the overall in-lieu lot policy stated at FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, in connection
with the policy on continuation of recreation residence use. The language in this provision has been revised to be
consistent with the overall policy.

The language at FSH 2709.11, section 41.23c of the proposed policy provides the procedural guidance for implementing
the overall policy on offering in-lieu lots. Paragraph one of this section limited the availability of lots for in-lieu
lot purposes to 12 months following notification of the holder that a new permit would not be offered. The agency finds
that this limitation is inconsistent with the policy requiring a 10-year notification to the holder. Lots which come
available during that 10-year period should be available as in-lieu lots if not otherwise needed for other public
purposes. Thus, the agency has restored the language of the 1988 policy as follows: ``If lots do not become available
until later, offer them then.'' Paragraph 3 allowed the holder 90 days from the date of a joint inspection to accept
the offer of an in-lieu lot. This has been clarified to require both actions_arranging a joint inspection and providing
90 days to decide. The paragraph is also clarified to require the 90 day period to occur while access to the lot is possible.
Paragraph 4 required that a new permit be issued when a holder accepts the offer of an in-lieu lot. The agency recognizes
that his means the holder will have two permits for recreation residence use for a limited period of time. However,
this provision has been kept in the final policy to be consistent with overall special use regulations which require
all users of National Forest land to have a permit.

<TEXT>
 

The agency recognizes that a holder may pay annual fees on both permits if the current use is kept while the use on the
in-lieu lot is being constructed. Thus, it has inserted guidance that a partial fee waiver under existing agency policy
may be appropriate on the in-lieu lot.

Readers are also advised that for consistency in terminology, the word ``lot'' replaces the word ``site'' throughout
the policy when referring to in-lieu locations.



7. Termination During Term of Permit. 

Three provisions of the proposed policy discussed actions to be taken when a recreation residence permit had to be
terminated before its term expired. The overall policy at FSM 2347.1 listed four reasons for terminating a permit:
(1) When it is in the public interest; (2) when there is an uncorrected breach of a permit provision; (3) when the site
has been rendered unsafe by catastrophic events; and (4) when there is other cause as provided in 36 CFR 251.60. In adding
this language, the proposed policy removed a provision of the 1988 policy that required termination actions to follow
the same procedures established for permit continuation or nonrenewal. Termination actions would follow procedures
for the four listed events, rather than for those procedures for continuance or nonrenewal as the 1988 policy provided.

Direction at FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 16, of the proposed policy reflected revisions to the overall policy, stating
termination could occur only in accordance with applicable regulations and the terms and conditions of the permit.
It also required the authorized officer (Forest Supervisor) to submit a proposed termination for review by the next
higher official (Regional Forester). This review would only examine the adequacy of the analysis and documentation.
If deficient, the proposed action would be returned to the authorized officer for correction and reconsideration.
This provision also proposed use of the term ``monies'' in place of ``appropriations'' as used in the 1988 policy to
describe the requirement that the Government must pay for the holders improvements if terminating a permit before
expiration of its term, except when termination is the result of breach of the permit's provisions.

The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23i gave direction only for termination actions resulting from noncompliance of
the terms and provisions of the permit. It required written notice to the holder and a reasonable period to correct
the violation. The action could be taken only if noncompliance continues after the holder receives notice and the
period allowed for correction. This provision was nearly identical to the 1988 policy.



Comment. 

There were 5 responses to these provisions of the proposed policy. Respondents felt the phrase ``in the public interest''
was vague and apparently confused the phrase with direction elsewhere in the proposed policy dealing with permit
expiration and alternative public use. They felt that termination should occur only when covered by the Forest plan
and other alternatives to removal of the use considered. Most of the respondents agreed that termination during the
permit term should occur only when funds are available to purchase the improvements. They agreed that the word ``monies''
is preferable to the word ``appropriations.'' One respondent, however, felt that payment for the holder's improvements
should be based on the cost of the improvements less depreciation.

Commenting on the direction in FSM 2721.23a, paragraph 16, one respondent suggested that ``applicable regulations''
should be specified. Most of the respondents agreed that proposed termination actions by the Forest Supervisor should
be reviewed by the Regional Forester but suggested that the standards for analysis and documentation for the proposed
termination should be made clear.



Response.

 Readers are reminded that the agency, in seeking consistency in policy terminology, has substituted the word revocation
for the word termination when describing actions that end a permit before the end of the term specified in the permit.
Further, the word termination is used to describe the cessation of a permit as a result of a fixed or agreed-upon event,
which would include reaching the end of the term specified in the permit. With this in mind, readers are advised that
revocation of the permit during its term and termination of the permit are two separate and distinct actions, each
unrelated to the other. Revocation of the permit occurs when one of the four actions listed in FSM 2347.1, paragraph
5, is triggered. Revocation of the permit when in the public interest is not an action resulting from direction in the
Forest plan. Rather, it results from an urgent and pressing need to reclaim the land for another public use before the
action can be considered through the Forest planning process and the procedure for considering alternative public
uses can be implemented. For example, the construction or relocation of a public highway may require removal of the
recreation residence because the only feasible right-of-way is on land occupied by this use. Authority to revoke
a permitted use before the permit term is completed is found at 36 CFR 251.60. This citation is added to this provision
in the final policy. It is the need to reclaim the land before completion of the permit term that requires the Government
to pay for the improvements that must be removed.

The Forest Service recognizes that an action to revoke a permit before completion of the term must be done under a procedure
that ensures fairness and equity to the holder. It has revised paragraph 5 in the final policy to clarify that revocation
would occur only when there is an urgent need to use the lot and the forest planning process cannot be used.

The agency also recognizes the concern of respondents that revocation actions be reviewed by a higher agency official.
However, it must point out that to maintain the integrity of its current appeal regulations it cannot permit the higher
level official to review a decision before it is made. When a Forest Supervisor's decision is appealed, the Regional
Forester is the reviewing officer. The language in the proposed policy on review of revocation actions will be maintained
in the final policy.

The agency believes that use of the word ``monies'' is appropriate and will retain the term in the final policy. The
agency does not agree that payment for the improvements be based on the holders cost less depreciation and will retain
the method set forth in the term permit.

Readers are advised that the procedure for revoking a permit when in the public interest and when the holder is found
to be in noncompliance with the permit terms is set forth in part VIII of the term permit.

Revised Special Use Permit for Recreation Residences



The Assistant Secretary's appeal decision voided certain clauses of the term special use permit used to authorize
recreation residences on National Forest System lands and adopted with the 1988 policy. Holders who had been offered
and accepted these permits in 1988 were notified by letter that the clauses were voided and temporarily removed from
the permit and would be replaced upon adoption by the agency of a final reformulated policy. The voided permit provisions
were: Part VI.C.2, part IX.B, C, D, and E, and part X.B. The October 10, 1991, notice displayed the term permit in its
entirety with the affected clauses reformulated to be consistent with the revisions to the proposed policy.

There were 346 comments received on the proposed permit. Nearly all of the responses were directed to permit clauses
not affected by the appeal decision. The 

Federal Register

 notice explained that only policy provisions, and permit clauses, affected by the appeal decision were subject to
review and reformulation. Hence, only those comments directed to permit clauses affected by the adoption of the final
policy were considered in this analysis. These were considered with the comments made to the corresponding parts
of the policy and procedural guidance.

Permit clauses are derived from basic statutes, regulations, and policy. Thus, in reformulating the policy for administering
recreation residences, the agency must also revise the permit that is derived from this policy. Changes made to the
policy require corresponding changes to the permit. This has been done in the adoption of this final policy. The reformulated
permit is printed in its entirety at the conclusion of this notice (Exhibit 1 to FSH 2709.11, section 54.1). Permit
clauses revised as a result of the reformulation of the recreation residence policy as described in this notice are
printed in italic. Readers are advised that holders of permits containing voided clauses will be sent new clauses
or new permits upon adoption of this final policy. New permits will contain the revised clauses but are identical in
all other respects to the permit accepted in 1988.



Revision of Dispute Resolution Provisions



The October 10, 1991, 

Federal Register

 notice provided information on the agency's policy to resolve disputes concerning recreation residence permit
administration (located at FSM 2721.23f in the 1988 policy). It pointed out that revision of the Department of Agriculture
administrative appeal regulations made on January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3342) created a conflict with the dispute resolution
provisions adopted in the 1988 policy. Revision of these provisions, although not addressed in the appeal decision,
was necessary.

The proposed policy at FSM 2721.23h provided direction to reduce conflict between holders and the agency by providing
holders with the opportunity to participate in an issue resolution process. Proposed paragraph 1 of this policy required
agency officials to consult with holders and their representatives, where practicable, before issuing written
decisions on permit administration in order to reach a common understanding and agreement. Proposed paragraph 2
encouraged holder involvement in the public involvement process for Forest planning, project analysis, and the
permit issuance analysis process (FSM 2721.23e). This paragraph also encouraged agency officials to meet with holders
and their representatives to discuss and resolve issues prior to issuing a decision. Proposed paragraph 3 provided
guidance on resolving actions that have been appealed, directing that the opportunities provided in the appeal regulations
(36 CFR parts 217 and 251) be utilized by the authorized officer to resolve the appeal issues by means other than review
and decision on the appeal.

The Forest Service has carefully considered the direction in the proposed policy in its preparation of this final
policy and determined that it adequately conveys its intent to resolve disputes with holders on recreation residence
permit administration. Therefore, it is adopting without change the direction in the proposed policy (FSM 2721.23h).

Readers are advised that further revisions to the appeal regulations occurred on April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19369). That
revision encourages participation in the agency's public involvement processes by expanding opportunities for
pre-decisional involvement of the public in Forest Service decisionmaking. A new part 215 was added to the regulations
that would give the public opportunity to comment, prior to issuance of a final decision, on proposed actions that
implement National Forest land and resource management plans. Parts 217 and 251, subpart C, of the regulations continue
in effect. This final recreation residence policy at FSM 2721.23h was examined in light of the new appeal regulation
and found to be consistent.



Clarification of Other Provisions of the Policy



In the February 15, 1989, appeal decision, the Assistant Secretary directed the Forest Service to clarify procedures
by which annual fees are determined for recreation residence use. Specifically, the agency was required to explain
its rationale in adopting 3 components of the fee system: (1) Use of the period 1978-1982 as the base period for
determining current fees, (2) Use of an index, the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IDP-GNP),
to adjust fees annually to current fair market value, and (3) Use of a factor of 5 percent applied to the appraised value
to determine the annual fee.

The Supplementary Information section of the October 10, 1991, 

Federal Register

 notice containing the proposed policy provided information on these three components of the fee policy. Readers
were advised that the information was to be considered as supplemental, or background, information to the direction
and procedural guidance appearing in the policy at FSM 2721.23d-Fee Determination and FSH 2709.11, chapter 30, section
33, Recreation Residence Fees. The information in the notice emphasized that the agency is required to obtain fair
market value for the use of the Federal lands. Fair market value is determined by appraisal or other sound business
management practice, such as market analysis or competitive bid. Annual fees for recreation residences are determined
by appraisal. A factor of 5 percent is applied to the appraised value to determine the annual fee.

<TEXT>
 

There were 55 responses to this information, which generally supported the information presented. There was some
disagreement with the use of 5 percent of appraised value to determine the annual fee, the respondents stating that
the factor should be higher. Two respondents felt the Consumer Price Index (CPI) should be used instead of the IPD-GNP.
Others felt the adjustment, as a national index factor, failed to recognize depressed local real estate market conditions.
As a result, fees were escalating upward that should have been steady or declining.

The Forest Service believes that the information presented in the notice accurately described the rationale used
to develop the fee determination procedure in the 1988 policy, and that the information reflects current agency direction
and policy. Therefore, the agency is adopting the explanation presented in the notice as its response to the appeal
decision's direction to present the rationale for adopting the period 1978-1982 as the annual fee base period,
the use of the IPD-GNP as the annual fee adjustment factor, and the use of 5 percent applied to appraised values
to determine annual fees.

Having considered the comments received in response to the October 10, 1991, notice of proposed policy and having
reconsidered the 1988 recreation residence policy for consistency with applicable law and regulation, the Forest
Service is adopting a revised recreation residence policy that it believes is fully responsive to the Assistant Secretary's
appeal decision and to the concerns of holders and other interested parties. The full text of the recreation residence
policy and procedural guidance containing the revisions described in this notice as it would appear in the Forest
Service Directive System is set out at the end of this notice.

Readers are advised that the current interim recreation residence policy will no longer be in effect upon adoption
of this revised policy.



Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public



This policy will not result in additional paperwork not already required by law or not already approved for use. Therefore,
the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR
1320 do not apply.



Regulatory Impact



This final policy has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.
It has been determined that this is not a significant rule. This rule will not have an annual effect of $100 million or
more on the economy nor adversely affect productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety,
nor State or local governments. This rule will not interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency nor raise
new legal or policy issues. Finally, this action will not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients of such programs. Accordingly, this final policy
is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.

Moreover, this final policy has been considered in light of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), and it has been determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities as defined by that Act. Entities affected by this policy are private individuals holding authorizations
to use National Forest System lands for the purpose of constructing and maintaining a recreation residence. The requirements
imposed by this final policy are the minimum necessary to protect the public interest, are not administratively burdensome
or costly to meet, and are well within the capability of small entities to perform.



Environmental Impact



Section 31.1b of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180; September 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in
an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Service-wide administrative
procedures, program processes or instructions.'' Based on consideration of the comments received and the nature
and scope of this final policy, the agency has determined that this rule falls within this category of actions and that
no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental
impact statement.

Reformulated Recreation Residence Policy and Procedures




Note:

 The Forest Service organizes its directive system by alpha-numeric codes and subject headings. Only those sections
of the Forest Service Manual and Handbook that are the subject of this notice are set out here. The intended audience
of this direction is Forest Service employees charged with issuing and administering recreation residence use authorizations.


Forest Service Manual
Chapter 2340_Privately Provided Recreation Opportunities


2347_Non-Commercial Recreation Use. Section 2347-2347.12b set forth direction for special use authorization
of privately built and owned structures on National Forest land. These structures are maintained for the use and enjoyment
of holders and their guests. As recreation facilities, they are vacation sites and may not be used on a permanent basis
(FSM 2721.23).


2347.03_Policy


1. Management non-commercial recreation use sites in accordance with basic recreation policy in FSM 2303 as valid
and important components of the overall National Forest recreation program.
2. Continue to authorize those existing facilities now occupying National Forest land under special use authorization
that (a) are consistent with management direction given in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (FSM 2721.23e),
(b) are at locations where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established, (c) do not constitute
a material, uncorrectable offsite hazard to National Forest resources, and (d) do not endanger the health or safety
of the holder or the public.
3. Manage non-commercial recreation use sites in such a way that the general public is not precluded from full enjoyment
of the natural, scenic, recreational, and other aspects of the National Forests (FSM 2701).
4. Deny applications for construction of new facilities except where they would replace similar existing facilities.
5. Deny any proposal for commercial activity at permitted, non-commercial recreation use sites.
6. Require non-commercial recreation use holders to maintain their sites to protect the natural forest environment.
Do not allow construction or placement of non-authorized facilities on these sites.


2347.1_Recreation Residences. (FSM 2721.23 and FSH 2709.11.)


Recreation residences are a valid use of National Forest System lands. They are an important component of the overall
National Forest recreation program and have the potential of supporting a large number of recreation person-days.
They may provide special recreation experiences that might not otherwise be available. It is Forest Service policy
to continue recreation residence use and to work in partnership with holders of these permits to maximize the recreational
benefits of these residences.
1. Administer recreation residence special use permits to ensure proper use of the lot for family and guest recreational
purposes (FSM 2347.11).
2. Do not approve any new authorizations for full-time residences, except in special situations to provide caretaker
or other similar services where there is a strongly demonstrated need (FSM 2347.12). Do not approve in-lieu lots for
full-time residential use.
3. Issue recreation residence term permits for a maximum of 20 years in accordance with procedures in FSM 2721.23e
and FSH 2709.11, sec. 41.23.
4. Give holders at least 10 years written advance notice if a new permit will not be issued following expiration of the
existing permit term (FSM 2721.23a).
5. Revoke a recreation residence permit before expiration of the term of the permit when (a) it is in the public interest,
particularly when the final decision authority does not rest with the Forest Service, (b) there is an uncorrected
breach of a permit provision(s) (FSM 2721.23i), (c) the site has been rendered unsafe by catastrophic events such
as flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement, or (d) when there is other cause as provided in 37 CFR 251.60. Revocation
in the public interest should not be undertaken unless monies are available to pay for the holder's improvements and
there is an urgent need to use the lot before the action can be considered through the Forest planning process resulting
in a decision to convert to an alternative public use. When revoking a permit for any cause, give as much advance notice
as possible (FSM 2721.23i).

6. Although provision of an in-lieu lot is not required, make a reasonable effort to provide a lot to holders whose lots
will be converted to an alternative public use and who have received notification that new permits for those lots will
not be issued or who have received revocation notices (except revocation for noncompliance) (FSM 2721.23e). For
this purpose, in-lieu lots must be in nonconflicting locations in or adjacent to established tracts within the National
Forest containing the residences, or in or adjacent to established tracts on adjacent National Forests. Appropriate
lots for consideration are undeveloped, formerly developed, and withdrawn lots in or adjacent to established recreation
residence tracts and which are not needed in the foreseeable future for other public uses. Lots that are vacant because
of noncompliance or other factors also may be considered as in-lieu lots. In-lieu lots should be comparable to the
lots being converted to an alternative public use when possible, but authorized officials should advise holders
that the Agency cannot guarantee that the available in-lieu lots will be entirely comparable. Do not establish new
recreation residence tracts for in-lieu lot purposes. Offer in-lieu lots in accordance with the procedures in FSH
2709.11, sec. 41.23c.

2347.11_Preventing Unauthorized Residential Use. Prevent unauthorized full-time residential use by enforcing
the terms of the special use permit. Continue to administer those recreation residences presently authorized as
a principal place of residence in accordance with provisions of the special use permit. Upon transfer or sale of improvements,
discontinue the residential use and authorize only recreation residence use.



2347.12_Caretaker Residences.



2347.12a_Authority. Authorize caretaker use of a recreation residence with an annual permit, Form 2700-4,
under the Act of June 4, 1897. (Require applicants who currently have term permits to exchange them as a condition of
obtaining the caretaker authorization.)

2347.12b_Caretaker Residence Use. The need for a caretaker residence rarely can be justified where yearlong occupancy
is already authorized in the tract. The Forest Supervisor may authorize a caretaker residence in limited cases where
it is demonstrated that caretaker services are needed for the security of a recreation residence tract and alternative
security measures are not feasible or reasonably available. The fees for caretaker residences shall be 25 percent
more than those charged for recreation residence use of a similar lot in the tract. A tract association may own caretaker
residences.

1. Authorize no more than one caretaker residence per recreation residence tract unless factors such as size and layout
of the tract call for more than one. The affected tract association, or if there is no association, at least 60 percent
of the affected holders, must document approval of request for a caretaker residence. Require the applicants for
caretaker use to document the caretaker services they will provide.

<TEXT>
 

2. Do not authorize construction of a new residence for caretaker services. Issue the annual permit only for an existing
residence. The permit must contain a provision that automatically terminates authorization for yearlong use in
case of change in ownership.
3. Coordinate applications for caretaker residence permits with local governmental agencies to avoid creating
unreasonable demands or burdens for such services as snow plowing, mail delivery, garbage pickup, school bus, or
emergency services.
4. If a lot ceases to be used as a caretaker residence, issue a new term permit for recreation residence use to the holder,
if qualified, or to the purchaser of the improvements.


Forest Service Manual
Chapter 2720_Special Uses Administration


2721.23_Recreation Residence. the term ``recreation residence'' includes only those residences that occupy planned,
approved tracts or those groups established for recreation residence use. See FSM 2347 for basic policy on recreation
residence use.
2721.23a_Administration. The following direction relates specifically to issuance and administration of special
use permits for recreation residences. For recreation residence permits in Alaska, follow the additional requirements
in section 1303(d) of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. Administer recreation residence permits
in accordance with the direction in sections 2721.23a-2721.23i and within the broad policy governing recreation
residences and permitted uses set forth in FSM 2347.1 and 36 CFR 251.50.
1. Issue special use permits for recreation residence use in the name of one individual or to a husband and wife. Upon
issuance of a new permit that continues the use or amendment, revise authorizations that are not issued to an individual
or to a husband and wife, so that the responsible person is identified.
2. Issue no more than one recreation residence special use permit to a single family (husband, wife, and dependent
children).
3. Do not issue special use permits for recreation residence use to entities such as commercial enterprises, nonprofit
organizations, business associations, corporations, partnerships, or other similar enterprises, except that
a tract association may own a caretaker residence.
4. To the extent possible, issue all recreation residence permits in a tract, or in logical groups of tracts, with the
same expiration date.
5. To help defray costs and provide additional recreation opportunities, a holder may obtain permission for incidental
rental for specific periods. Ensure that rental use is solely for recreation purposes and does not change the character
of the area or use to a commercial nature. Rental arrangements must be in writing and approved in advance by the authorized
officer. The holder must remain responsible for compliance with the special use authorization.
6. Allow no more than one dwelling per lot to be built. In those cases where more than one dwelling (residence/sleeping
cabin) currently occupies a single lot, allow the use to continue in accordance with the authorization. However,
correct such deficiencies, if built without prior approval, upon transfer of ownership outside of the family (husband,
wife and dependent children).
7. When a recreation residence is included in the settlement of an estate, issue a new special use permit for the remainder
of the original permit term, updated to reflect policy and procedural changes, to the properly determined heir, if
eligible. Prior to estate settlement, issue an annual renewable permit to the executor or administrator to identify
responsibility for the use pending final settlement of the estate. When a recreation residence is sold, issue a new
term permit to the buyer for the remainder of the original permit term, updated to reflect policy and procedural changes,
if eligible.
8. Specify in the permit that the recreation residence must be occupied at least 15 days annually, the minimum acceptable
period of occupancy.
9. Issue recreation residence term permits for a maximum of 20 years, except when the need for a shorter term has been
determined by a project analysis in accordance with FSM 2721.23e and FSH 2709.11, chapter 40.
10. When a decision is made to convert the lot to an alternative use (2721.23e), take the following actions:
a. Notify the holder of the reasons and provide a copy of the decision documentation.
b. Allow at least 10 years of continued occupancy after notification.

<PARENT> FR940602-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

c. Allow the current term permit to expire under its own terms and if the holder is entitled to additional time to satisfy
the 10-year notification period, issue a new term permit for the remaining period. Clearly specify any limited tenure
by including the following statement in the permit:
``This permit will expire on (insert date) and a new permit will not be issued.''
d. Issue term or annual permits for additional periods as needed to allow continuation of occupancy until conversion
to the alternate public use is ready to begin.
11. Before the Forest Supervisor issues a decision to convert a lot to an alternative public use, submit the proposed
decision, supporting documentation and summary of public comments, to the Regional Forester for review for adequacy
of the documentation and analysis. If analysis and documentation are inadequate to support the proposed decision
or there is some other deficiency in the proposed decision, the Regional Forester shall instruct the Forest Supervisor
to remedy the deficiencies and reconsider the proposed decision prior to making the final decision.
12. As with any resource allocation made in a Forest plan, the Forest Supervisor may reconsider a decision to continue
or convert recreation residence lots to an alternative public use at any time new or changed conditions merit such
reconsideration.
13. In the event a recreation residence is destroyed or substantially damaged by a catastrophic event such as a flood,
avalanche, or massive earth movement, conduct and document an environmental analysis to determine whether improvements
on the lot can be safely occupied in the future under Federal and State law before issuing a permit to rebuild or terminating
the permit. Normally, an analysis should be completed within 6 months of such an event.
Allow rebuilding if the lot can be occupied safely and the use remains consistent with the Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan. If the need for an alternative public use at the same location has been established prior to the catastrophic
event, do not allow rebuilding if the improvements are more than 50 percent destroyed. If rebuilding is not authorized,
in-lieu lots may be offered as provided by FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6 and FSH 2709.11, section 41.23c.
14. At the time permits are issued, advise holders that the terms of the permit require that they notify the Forest Service
if they intend to sell their improvements and that they must provide a copy of the permit to a prospective purchaser
before finalizing a sale. Whenever possible, the authorized officer should advise a prospective purchaser of the
terms and conditions of the permit before a sale is final.
15. Do not stay a fee increase pending completion of an appeal of the fee under the administrative appeal regulations.
Make any adjustments resulting from the administrative review through credit, refund, or supplemental billing.
16. During the term of a permit, terminate or revoke the use only in accordance with regulations at 36 CFR 251.60 and
the terms and conditions of the permit (FSM 2347.1, para. 5). Except for revocation for noncompliance of terms of the
permit, the Forest Supervisor shall submit proposed revocations, with supporting documentation and a summary of
the public comments, to the Regional Forester for review prior to the Forest Supervisor's issuance of a decision.
If analysis and documentation are inadequate to support the proposed decision or there is some other deficiency in
the proposed decision, the Regional Forester shall instruct the Forest Supervisor to remedy the deficiencies and
reconsider the proposed revocation prior to making the final decision.
2721.23b_

Applications.

 Insofar as practicable, notify a new or prospective owner of the requirement to make application for the authorization
to use existing improvements in accordance with 36 CFR 251.54.


2721.23c_Permit Preparation.


1. Use the Term Special Use Permit for Recreation Residence (Form FS 2700-5a, FSH 2709.11, ch. 50), to authorize
recreation residences, except as specified in paragraph 2 of this section.
2. Use the Special Use Permit (Form FS-2700-4) when:
a. Conversion of the lot to a alternative public use is authorized, the conversion will be delayed, and a minimum term
of continued use cannot be predicted.
b. Continuance of the recreation residence use is conditioned on the owner complying with specific Forest Service
requirements before a term permit is issued.
c. The improvements are managed by a third party pending settlement of an estate, bankruptcy proceedings, or other
legal action.
d. Yearlong occupancy is authorized by the Forest Supervisor, at which time the improvement ceases to be a recreation
residence.
3. In either permit, identify all authorized improvements associated with recreation residence use. Do not authorize
use of more than the statutory maximum of 5 acres under a term permit. Authorize community or association-owned improvements,
such as water systems, by a separate special use permit (Form FS-2700-4).


2721.23d_Fee Determination. (FSH 2709.11, ch. 30.).


1. Use fair market value as determined by appraisal in determining the base annual rental fees for recreation residence
lots. Redetermine the base fee at 20-year intervals.
2. Adjust the fee annually by the annual (second quarter to second quarter) change in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross
National Product (IPD-GNP).
3. Use professional appraisal standards in appraising recreation residence lots for fee determination purposes
(FSH 2709.11.)
4. Where practicable, contract with private fee appraisers to perform the appraisal.
5. Require appraisers to coordinate the assignment closely with affected holders by seeking advice, cooperation,
and information from the holders and local holder associations.
6. Retain only qualified appraisers. To the extent practicable, use those appraisers most knowledgeable of market
conditions within the local area.
7. Before accepting any appraisal, conduct a full review of the appraisal to ensure the instructions have been followed
and the assigned values are supported properly.

Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special Uses

Chapter 30_Fee Determination



33_Recreation Residence Fees

33.1_Base Fees and Indexing. Follow these procedures in determining the base (beginning) fee and subsequent fees
under a 20-year cycle.



1. As the initial base, use the fees established in one of the years between 1978 and 1982. The first year of the fee cycle
is the first year of the established fee (disregarding any phase-in that may have been provided). Adjust the full base
fee forward by applying the appropriate cumulative Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD-GNP)
adjustment factor shown in exhibit 01. New fees for 1989, established in this manner, will be phased-in over a 4-year
period (1989-1992) at the rate of one-fourth of the increase each year, except that fees will not be phased-in
for those permits that limit fee adjustments to 5-year intervals.

In those cases where there may not be a fee established for the 1978-1982 period, Regional Foresters are authorized,
subject to concurrence of the Chief, to utilize a different starting date and to adjust the length of the fee cycle so
that all permits will have a new base fee determined during the 1998-2002 period.

2. For 1990 through the last year of the fee cycle, adjust the fees on an annual basis by calculating the percentage change
of the IPD-GNP index (as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce, in July of each
year) from the second quarter of the previous year to the second quarter of the current year and applying this percentage
adjustment factor to the current year's fees.

For term permits that restrict adjustments to 5-year intervals, apply the IPD index adjustments cumulatively at
5-year intervals. At the end of the current 20-year term, or earlier if agreed to by the holder, revise permits to provide
for annual indexing.

3. Limit the annual fee adjustment for 1990 and thereafter to 10 percent per year when the change in the IPD-GNP
index exceeds 10 percent in any one year. The index amount in excess of 10 percent will be carried over and applied to
the fee for the next succeeding year in which the index factor is less than 10 percent.

4. If a new permit is to be issued (FSM 2721.23a), re-appraise the lot toward the end of the 20-year cycle. Beginning
in the twenty-first year (the first year of the next fee cycle; 1998 in the case of 1978 fees), put into effect the base
fee for the next 20-year cycle by applying 5 percent to the newly determined appraised market value of the lot for recreation
residence purposes.

5. In those few cases where one or more additional sleeping structures (guest cabins, and so forth) have been added
to a single lot, add to the current adjusted base fee an additional charge equal to 25 percent of the fee established
for a single residence use of the lot or $100, whichever is greater, per structure.

The above factors for fee years 1979-1986 were taken from Table 5, Price Indexes and the Gross National Product
Implicit Price Deflator, as published in the Survey of Current Business by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic
Analysis, February 1986. These factors represent an annual rate, based on the percent change from the first quarter
to the second quarter of the indicated year. The 1987 factor of 1.026 is the percentage change in the IPD-GNP index
from the second quarter of 1985 to the second quarter of 1986 as reported in the July 1986 issue of ``United States Department
of Commerce News,'' a publication by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The IPD-GNP index for the second quarter
of 1985 is 111.1. The 1988 and 1989 factors, were determined following the same procedures, using the appropriate
year's publication. The factors for 1979-1989 in Exhibit 01 are shown only to illustrate how the cumulative
adjustment factor used to establish the 1989 fee is determined. The factor was determined by chain multiplying the
factor for the years within the base fee year period (for 1982 this would be 1.050  x  1.032  x  1.038  x 
1.033  x  1.026  x  1.028  x  1.029 = 1.261.) See exhibit 02 for examples of applications.



Exhibit 02, Sec. 33.1_Examples of Use of IPD-GNP Table



The following two examples illustrate use of the IPD-GNP adjustment factors in exhibit 01 in determining the
1989 fee:



(1) Example 1.

 A fee of $412 that became established in 1982 (first year in the fee cycle) would be adjusted to $520 in 1989 ($412  x 
1.261). This would be the fee amount owed by a holder who does not accept the new term permit and would remain constant
until the end of the five year adjustment period. If a new term permit is accepted, the fee would be phased-in, and the
holder would be charged $439 for 1989, instead of the full amount.



(2) Example 2.

 A 1980 base year fee of $315 would be adjusted to $464 ($315  x  1.473) with the actual 1989 charge limited to $352
for a new term permit. A holder who keeps the old permit would pay the full fee of $464 in 1989.

Under both examples, factors for the years 1990 and thereafter will be determined in the same manner as the 1989 factor.
Using the 1989 factor as an example, the index for the second quarter of 1987 as reported in the July 1987 Bureau publication
is 117.2; the index for February 1988 in the July 1988 Bureau publication is 120.6. The percentage change in the index
to be used to determine 1989 fees is 120.6 minus 117.2 divided by 117.2. Thus, 1989 fees will be 2.9 percent higher than
1988 for those permits that are indexed.

Using the above two examples, calculation of the 1990 fees for those accepting new term permits would be as follows:
(A 1990 IPD-GNP adjustment factor of 1.028 is assumed.)


(1) Example 1. 

The full 1989 fee of $520 times the IPD-GNP index factor for 1990 of 1.028 equals $535, the full fee for 1990. The
increase in the fee is $15. The amount of the 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $54 ($520^$412 = $108/2 = $54).
Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1982 fee of $412 + $54 + $15 = $484.


(2) Example 2. 

The full 1990 fee equals $477, a fee increase of $13. The amount of the 1989 fee increase to be phased-in in 1990 is $75
($464^$315 = $149/2 = $75). Thus, the 1990 fee to be charged is the base 1980 fee of $315 + $75 + $13 = $403.
33.11_Fee Credits. In billing holders for fees, reduce the fee by the amount of any unused or remaining credits due
holders under provisions of the Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 1983 through 1986.
33.2_Fees on Nonrenewal. When permits are placed on tenure (that is, a new special use permit will not be issued following
expiration), the annual fee for the tenth year prior to the expiration date of the current permit becomes the base fee.
The fee for each year during the last ten years is one-tenth of the base fee multiplied by the number of years then remaining
on the permit. For example, charge a holder with nine years remaining 90 percent of the base fee; with eight years, 80
percent; and so forth.
Use the following schedule to calculate the holder's fee during the 10-year period:






When a review of the decision to convert the lot to an alternative public use shows that changed conditions warrant
continuation of the recreation residence, use the following fee determination procedures:
1. If a new 20-year term permit is issued, the Forest Service shall recover the amount of fees foregone while the previous
permit was under notice that the lot would be converted to an alternative public use. Collect this amount evenly over
a 10-year period in addition to the annual fee due under the new permit. The obligation runs with the lot and shall be
charged to a subsequent purchaser.
The annual fee under the newly issued 20-year permit shall be the annual index adjusted fee computed as though no limit
on tenure existed, plus the amount specified above until paid in full.

<TEXT>
 

2. If a 20-year term permit is not issued, and the occupancy of the subject lot is to be allowed to continue for less than
10 years (that is, authorized by a new permit for a specified term), do not recover past fees. Determine the fee for a
new permit of less than 10 years by computing the fee as if notice that a new permit would not be issued had not been given,
reduced by the appropriate percentage for the number of years of the extension (that is, a 6-year tenure period results
in a fee equal to 60 percent of the base fee).

3. If a 20-year term permit is not issued, and the occupancy of the subject lot is to be allowed to continue for more than
10 years (authorized by a new permit for a term of less than 20 years), the Forest Service shall recover fees as outlined
in preceding paragraph 1, computed for the most recent 10-year period in which the term of the permit was limited.

33.3_Appraisals. Use the following process to determine the fair market value of recreation residence lots.

1. Use appraisals made by professional appraisers for determining the market value of the fee simple estate of the
National Forest land underlying the lot subject to a special use permit, but without consideration as to how the authorization
would or could affect the fee title of the lot (FSH 5409.12, ch. 6 for the standard contract to be used to establish fair
market value of recreation residence lots).

2. In consultation with affected holders, select and appraise typical lots (rather than all individual lots) within
groups that have essentially the same or similar value characteristics. Within such groupings, adjust for measurable
differences between the lots. (Once properly established, typical site classifications should rarely change.)

3. Ensure appraised values are based on comparable market sales of sufficient quality and quantity that will result
in the least amount of dollar adjustment to make them reflective of the subject lots' characteristics. Such characteristics
include:

a. Physical differences between subject lot and the comparable sales.

b. Legal constraints imposed upon the market by governmental agencies.

c. Economic considerations evident in the local market.

d. Locational considerations of subject lot in relation to the market (sales) comparable.

e. Functional usability and utility of the lot.

f. Amenities occurring to the lot as compared with selected sales comparables.

g. Availability of improvements (such as roads, water systems, and power lines) provided by nonholder entities,
including the United States. Do not adjust for improvements furnished by holders.

h. Other market forces and factors identified as having a quantifiable effect upon value.



33.31_Appraisers.



1. Select fee appraisers who hold a current certification of competence from a nationally recognized professional
appraisal organization. In the case of Forest Service appraisers, use those individuals who have received adequate
training through professional appraisal organizations and who have satisfactorily completed the basic courses
necessary to demonstrate competence.

2. Require appraisers to sign a standard agreement that states:

a. The approved appraisal format to be used.

b. The approved standard forms to be used.

c. A full, complete, and accurate definition of the appraisal problem.

d. The standards of professional competence, ethics, and practice to which the appraiser shall adhere.

e. Those requirements of the appraisal assignment that may be imposed under (1) statutes, (2) Federal regulations,
(3) Forest Service policies and procedures, and (4) situations unique to the given appraisal assignment.

3. Require appraisers to notify affected holders by mail and offer to meet with them to discuss the assignment, answer
questions specific to the assignment, and seek advice, information, and cooperation from the holders and their local
organizations. The appraiser must notify holders of such a meeting at least 30 days in advance of the meeting. Send
notices to the address used for bills for collection. Use the notice to give the holders advance information on the
appraisal assignment. At such meetings, require that the appraiser have available copies of the appraisal instructions,
directions, and requirements for review by the holders. An appraisal cannot be made prior to the meeting with the holders.



33.32_Establishing Recreation Residence Lot Value.



1. Upon receipt of the appraisal report, conduct a review of the appraisal in conformance with the standards of the
National Association of Review Appraisers.

2. Following review and acceptance of the appraisal, notify affected holders of Forest Service acceptance of the
report. In the notification, inform holders that they and other interested parties have 45 days in which to review
the appraisal. Upon request, provide copies of the report(s) and supporting documentation pursuant to the Freedom
of Information Act.

3. Upon request, provide an opportunity for affected holders to obtain, at their expense, an appraisal report from
an appraiser holding at least the same or similar qualifications as the one selected by the Forest Service.

a. The Forest Service shall provide holders with a copy of the standards used by the appraiser selected by the Forest
Service and holders shall provide the standards to the holder-employed appraiser. The holder must require the observance
of these standards, including a signed certification that ensures an understanding of the appraisal instructions
and standards. Reject any appraisals that do not meet these standards.

b. Subject the holder-furnished appraisal to the same review requirements as the appraisal obtained by the Forest
Service.

4. Give full and complete consideration to both appraisals. If the two appraisals disagree in value by more than 10
percent, ask the two appraisers to try and reconcile or reduce their differences. If the appraisers cannot agree,
the Forest Supervisor will utilize either or both appraisals to determine the fee, unless a third appraisal is requested
and accepted by the Supervisor.

5. When requested, seek a third appraisal.

a. The cost shall be shared equally by the holder and the Forest Service.

b. This appraisal must meet the same standards of the first and second appraisals. The Forest Supervisor has discretion
to accept or reject the third appraisal.



Forest Service Manual

Chapter 2720_Special Uses Administration



2721.23e_Recreation Residence Continuance. See FSM 2347.1 for the general policy on recreation residence use.
Follow the direction in this section and the procedures in section 41.23, FSH 2709.11 in determining whether recreation
residence term permits may be issued for a new term at current sites. Exhibit 01, section 41.23c, FSH 2709.11, depicts
the permit continuance process.

The Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan) provides direction for continuance of the recreation residence
use (FSM 1920). As Forest plans are revised, availability for recreation residence use shall be explicitly addressed
in the plan through delineation of management areas and associated management area prescriptions (FSM 1920).

Decisions to issue new recreation residence term permits following expiration of the current term permit require
a determination of consistency with the current Forest plan. Make this determination by evaluating the extent to
which continued recreation residence use adheres to the standards and guidelines which apply to the appropriate
management area. Address continuation of recreation residence use on a tract or group of tracts basis, not on individual
lots.



1. Use Is Consistent With Forest Plan. 

When recreation residence use is consistent with the Forest plan, it shall continue. If the use has been analyzed sufficiently
as part of a EA or EIS completed within the 5 years prior to permit expiration, issue a new term permit upon expiration
of the current term permit. Issue a record of decision or a decision notice and finding of no significant impact only
if the use was not specifically approved in the appropriate decision document. If the use has changed and such change
has not been analyzed sufficiently as part of a completed EA or EIS, complete the appropriate environmental analysis
(FSH 1909.15). If the EA or EIS indicating the use is consistent with the Forest Plan was completed more than 5 years
prior to permit expiration, additional environmental documentation is necessary (FSH 1909.15, sec. 18.03). Initiate
action to issue a new term permit within 2 years prior to permit expiration.



2. Use May Not Be Consistent With Forest Plan. 

When the lands currently authorized for recreation residence use are allocated to alternative public uses through
amendment or revision of the Forest Plan, and continued recreation residence use may be inconsistent with standards
and guidelines which apply to the appropriate management area, the Forest Supervisor shall conduct a project analysis
of the alternative public use(s) (FSH 1909.15). This project analysis shall consider continuation of existing recreation
residence use through appropriate modification of the term permit provisions or amendment of the Forest plan to accommodate
the use, or discontinuation of the use (See FSM 2347.1 for recreation residence use continuance). Decisions reached
by the project analysis must comply with NEPA requirements and are subject to appeal under Department of Agriculture
appeal regulations at 36 CFR part 215 and 36 CFR part 251, subpart C.

a. If the project analysis results in a decision to amend the Forest plan so that the recreation residence use may continue,
modify the provisions of the current term permits as appropriate. New term permits can be issued following current
permit expiration. Additional environmental documentation may be necessary (FSH 1909.15).

b. If the project analysis results in a decision to convert a lot to an alternative public use at some point in the future,
grant the holder at least 10 years continued use from the date of the decision, unless the continued use conflicts with
law and regulation, and identify the specific alternative public use(s) for which the land is being recovered. As
provided by FSM 2347.1, the authorized officer may allow continued use of the lot until such time as conversion of the
new use is ready to begin by issuing a new permit for the remaining period and amending the Forest plan if needed.

c. Review the project analysis decision two years prior to permit expiration to determine if there have been any changes
in resource conditions that require another look at the decision. If the decision was made less than 5 years prior to
permit expiration and the review shows that conditions have not changed, implement the project analysis-based decision.
Affirmation of such decision is not appealable (36 CFR 251.83). If the decision was made more than 5 years from permit
expiration and/or review indicates that resource conditions have changed, update the analysis to determine the
proper action. Decisions arising from this new analysis are appealable.

2721.23f_In-Lieu Lots. When new permits will not be issued following expiration of the present permit, make a reasonable
effort to provide an in-lieu lot, if available, at locations not needed in the foreseeable future (generally, the
period covered by the Forest plan) for alternative public uses in accordance with FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6 and FSH 2709.11,
section 41.23d.

2721.23g_Land Exchange. Proposals to convey recreation residence tracts into private ownership by land exchange
may be considered at any time. Such proposals must be processed in accordance with the instructions in FSM 5430 applicable
to all land exchanges.

2721.23h_Cooperation and Issue Resolution. Authorized officers shall strive to reduce conflict between holders
and the Forest Service arising from permit administration. As necessary, specify a Forest Officer to work with the
holders, their representatives, and other interested parties on specific issues.

1. Provide opportunity for holders and their representatives to participate in issue resolution. Where practicable,
except where an imminent hazard or risk to health and safety or resources requires immediate action prior to issuing
written decisions related to permit administration, consult and meet in person, or by telephone, with holders and
their representatives to discuss any issues or concerns related to the permit and to reach a common understanding
and agreement.

<TEXT>
 

2. During Forest plan amendment or revision and project analysis, seek full involvement of holders and their representatives
in public involvement opportunities and activities. Encourage and solicit their input and comments. Meet with holders
and their representatives to discuss any issues or concerns arising in the planning and analysis processes and explore
opportunities to resolve those issues prior to issuing a decision.
3. If a decision is appealed, utilize the opportunities provided in the appeal rules (36 CFR part 215, part 217 and part
251, subpart C) to discuss the appeal with the appellant(s) and intervenor(s) (and/or their representatives) together
or separately to explore opportunities to resolve the issue by means other than review and decision on the appeal.
2721. 23i_Noncompliance. Give written notice and provide a reasonable opportunity for holder to correct special
use permit violations before terminating the use for noncompliance with the permit conditions (36 CFR 251.60(e)).
Revocation for noncompliance shall be only for a breach of a permit provision(s) that continues after notice and a
reasonable opportunity for correction has been given (FSM 2347.1, para. 5).
2721.23j_Lot Restoration. On expiration of a permit which will not be reissued or revocation or termination prior
to expiration (FSM 2721.23a(10), 2721.23a(16)), except for revocation in the public interest, require the holder
to restore the property to a condition acceptable to the Forest Supervisor (36 CFR 251.60(j)). The holder may relinquish
the improvements to the Forest Service upon approval of the Forest Supervisor. Terms and conditions for lot restoration
are given in the term permit issued for recreation residences.


Forest Service Handbook 2709.11_Special Uses
Chapter 40_Special Uses Administration


41.23_Recreation Residence Use.


41.23a_Permit Continuance. When a Forest plan is amended or revised and recreation residence use remains consistent
with management direction given in the Forest plan, issue a new permit to the same holder in accordance with the following:
1. Since recreation residences have been in place for many years, and experience in administering this use has shown
that continuing the use does not cause significant environmental impacts, issuance of a new permit can be made without
further environmental documentation (FSM 2721.23e), except when the following situations are present:
a. If the use has been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed within 5 years of permit expiration, but
not specifically addressed in a decision document, confirm the consistency of the use with the management direction
in the Forest plan by issuing a record of decision or a decision notice and finding of no significant impact.
b. If the use has not been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed within 5 years of permit expiration,
complete the appropriate environmental analysis and documentation (FSH 1909.15).
c. If an EA or EIS indicating the use is consistent with the Forest plan was completed more than 5 years prior to permit
expiration, additional environmental documentation may be necessary (FSH 1909.15).
d. If there are changes in the use and the changed use has been analyzed sufficiently as part of an EA or EIS completed
within 5 years of permit expiration and approved in the appropriate decision document no further action is required.
If the changed use has not been analyzed sufficiently as part of a completed EA or EIS and approved in the appropriate
decision document, environmental documentation may be necessary. Such documentation may be accomplished by categorical
exclusion (FSH 1909.15).
2. Initiate the analysis and action to issue a new permit 2 years prior to expiration of the current term permit and notify
the holder of the outcome of the action.

<TEXT>
 

3. Ensure the current use is in full compliance with the terms of the permit before issuing the new term permit.
4. Review and update the term permit provisions to ensure that the new permit contains those clauses necessary to comply
with all current regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture and all present Federal, State, or county laws, regulations,
or ordinances which are applicable to the area covered by the permit.
41.23b_

Project Analysis.

 When a Forest plan is amended or revised and consistency of the existing recreation residence use with new Forest plan
management direction is uncertain, conduct a site specific project analysis to verify the new direction. Recognize
that an inconsistency indicated by the Forest plan is not tantamount to recreation residence removal. Recreation
residence use may continue by appropriate modification of the term permit provisions to recognize specific occupancy
conditions, or by amendment of the Forest plan to accommodate the use (FSM 2721.23e.1.b).


1. Public Involvement.

 During the project analysis process, encourage and solicit information, comments, and involvement from holders
and other interested parties. Follow Forest Service public involvement procedures, including those associated
with NEPA (FSM 1620, FSH 1900.12, and FSH 1909.15). Facilitate holder involvement by timing review periods as closely
as possible to the recreation residence use season.


2. Analysis Documentation.

 The project analysis record and appropriate NEPA compliance document must contain objective, detailed information
regarding existing recreation residence use and other applicable resource conditions. The documentation must
include a full range of alternatives that includes consideration for retention of some or all of the existing recreation
residence use.


3. Analysis Factors and Considerations.
a. Lot use.

 Examine the relationship of the existing recreation residence use with the proposed alternative public use of the
lot, including compatibility and conflict. Describe any current or anticipated conflicts between recreation residence
use and the proposed use. Examine and describe the feasibility of other sites to meet the proposed use or how the proposed
use could be provided for by modifying recreation residence use or by modifying the proposed use.
Develop a range of alternatives that:
(1) If possible, examine and describe ways to meet the proposed use without significant conflict with existing recreation
residence uses and how potential conflicts can or cannot be mitigated.
(2) Examine the feasibility of common, shared, or multiple use that includes recreation residences. Also examine
the feasibility of adjusting lot and tract sizes, configurations and boundaries, or relocation of lot improvements
to better accommodate such use.
(3) Examine the feasibility of alternative sites for recreation residence use and for the proposed use.
(4) Compare the benefits and disadvantages of the proposed use with the benefits and disadvantages of continued recreation
residence use, including economic considerations, such as the cost of removing the use.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940602-2-00179 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940602-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Examine the feasibility of using land exchanges to accommodate recreation residence and/or the proposed use.



B. Other Resource Impacts.

 Show how recreation residence occupancy is compatible or in conflict with other National Forest System resources.
Consider the applicability of section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and other Federal and State laws
which may have an effect on these resources.



c. Environmental Impacts.

 Discuss the environmental impacts of continued recreation residence use, together with the impacts of any improvements
necessary for their continued use, compared with the impacts of the proposed use. Examine the environmental, economic,
and social impacts of recreation residence use, the proposed use, and alternative public uses, particularly any
necessary construction.



4. Decision Issuance and Documentation.

a. If the project analysis results in a finding that continued recreation residence use will not conflict with the
proposed alternative public use, issue a decision to amend the Forest plan, and modify existing permits as appropriate.
Issue new term permits for the applicable lots following permit expiration. The decision document shall summarize
the conclusions regarding recreation residence use and provide a basis for the issuance of new permits.

b. If the project analysis results in a finding that (1) the recreation residence use is in some degree inconsistent
with the Forest plan but that continued use does not conflict with the proposed alternative public use, or (2) that
the proposed use can accommodate some or all of the recreation residence use, issue a decision to amend the Forest plan
and modify existing permits as appropriate. Issue new term permits for the applicable lots following permit expiration.
The decision document shall summarize the conclusions regarding continued recreation residence use and delineate,
as appropriate, which permits will not be continued and which will receive new term permits.

c. If the project analysis results in a finding that recreation residence use remains inconsistent with the Forest
plan and is not compatible with the proposed use, issue a decision that the recreation residences lots are to be removed
and the lots converted to the proposed use.

d. In addition to other requirements specified in FSH 1909.15, the decision document shall include the following:

(1) The estimated time of conversion.

(2) The reasons the recreation residence use is or is not compatible with the proposed use.

(3) The reasons why the proposed use was chosen over others.

(4) A summary of alternatives to the conversion, including the possibility of combining or sharing use with recreation
residence use; adjusting lots or locations of improvements to better accommodate common or shared uses; and alternatives
suggested by affected holders and other interested members of the public.

(5) The reasons any conflict between the recreation residences and the proposed use cannot be resolved.

(6) Cost effectiveness of the proposed use.

5. Decision Notification.

a. Notify holders and any interested parties of the decision and provide copies of the project analysis, NEPA documentation,
any Forest plan amendment, and decision document as soon as possible after the decision along with notice of appeal
rights under 36 CFR part 217 or part 251, subpart C.

b. When lots will be converted to the proposed use and new permits will not be issued upon expiration of the present permits,
provide with the decision notification:

(1) Ten years or more notice that the lots will be converted to the proposed use (FSM 2721.23a). Normally, use the same
conversion date for all affected holders in a particular group or tract.

(2) Notice that the holder should refrain from making costly repairs, improvements, or expenditures except those
that are necessary to protect holder and public health or safety.

(3) Notice of whether in-lieu lots will or will not be made available, although the location of those in-lieu lots may
not be known until permit expiration approaches.

(4) Notice that fees will be adjusted in accordance with FSH 2709.11, section 33.2.

6. Project Analysis Decision Review.

 Two years prior to permit expiration (usually the 18th permit year), Forest Supervisors shall review project analysis
decisions affecting those permits that are more than five years old to determine if there have been any changes in resource
conditions that require reconsideration of the decision.

For all reviews, the following apply:

a. Reviews shall be objective, comprehensive, and in writing. New information, changed resource conditions, and
new or changed land allocations made through the forest planning process shall be reviewed to determine if a new project
analysis and/or additional NEPA compliance is needed.

b. When initiating the review, notify affected holders and interested publics in writing and provide opportunity
for involvement in accordance with Forest Service public involvement procedures.

c. If review indicates that conditions have not changed, implement the decision.


d. If review indicates that conditions have changed, initiate a new project analysis, including NEPA compliance,
to determine future use of the lot(s).

e. Notify affected holders and interested publics in writing of review findings, including notice that the result
of the review is not appealable (36 CFR 251.83).

41.23d_In-Lieu Lots. Pursuant to FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6, in-lieu lots may be offered to holders who have received
notice that their permits are being revoked for reasons other than noncompliance or that a new permit will not be issued
following expiration of their existing permits because the lot is needed for an alternative public use. Identify
and offer in-lieu lots in accordance with FSM 2347.1, paragraph 6 and FSM 2721.23f and follow these procedures:

1. When available, offer in-lieu lots to holders at the time that notice is given that the lot will be converted to an
alternative public use and a new permit will not be issued. If lots do not become available until later, offer them then.

2. Give first priority to identifying and offering in-lieu lots in the same tract or an expansion of that tract, where
feasible.

3. Arrange a joint inspection of the in-lieu lot with the holder. Allow the holders 90 days from the date of the joint
inspection of the in-lieu lot or 90 days from the final disposition of any appeals of the decision to convert the lot
to an alternative public use, whichever is later, to accept or reject the offer. The 90-day period shall occur while
access to the lot is possible.


4. When holders accept such offers, issue a new permit and reserve the offered lots. Do not charge a fee until the holder
begins construction of improvements on the lot. A partial waiver of fees for the in-lieu lot may be appropriate until
the improvements are actually occupied. The lot reservation will expire upon holder's failure to begin construction
on the in-lieu lot on a mutually-agreed upon schedule.

5. Allow holders accepting offers to continue use of their current lots until the expiration date. Inform the holders
that they should be prepared to move to the in-lieu lot during the 24 months prior to permit expiration, provided the
supplemental review of the decision to convert the present lot to an alternative public use has been completed.

6. The opportunity to develop an in-lieu lot, if accepted by the previous owner, shall be extended to the new owner,
if eligible, when there is a change in ownership of authorized improvements.

7. Do not offer in-lieu lots for revocation actions stemming from noncompliance with special use permit terms.

Supervisor.

B. The authorized officer under this permit is the Forest Supervisor, or a delegated subordinate officer.

C. This permit authorizes only personal recreation use of a noncommercial nature by the holder, members of the holder's
immediate family, and guests. Use of the permitted improvements as a principal place of residence is prohibited and
shall be grounds for revocation of this permit.

D. Unless specifically provided as an added provision to this permit, this authorization is for site occupancy and
does not provide for the furnishing of structures, road maintenance, water, fire protection, or any other such service

VI. Fees



A. Fee Requirement: This special use authorization shall require payment in advance of an annual rental fee.

B. Appraisals:

1. Appraisals to ascertain the fair market value of the 

lot

 will be conducted by the Forest Service at least every 20 years. The next appraisal will be implemented in *

XXXX

 (insert year).

2. Appraisals will be conducted and reviewed in a manner consistent with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal
Practice, from which the appraisal standards have been developed, giving accurate and careful consideration to
all market forces and factors which tend to influence the value of the 

lot

.

3. If dissatisfied with an appraisal utilized by the Forest Service in ascertaining the permit fee, the holder may
employ another qualified appraiser at the holder's expense. The authorized officer will give full and complete consideration
to both appraisals provided the holder's appraisal meets Forest Service standards. If the two appraisals disagree
in value by more than 10 percent, the two appraisers will be asked to try and reconcile or reduce their differences.
If the appraisers cannot agree, the Authorized Officer will utilize either or both appraisals to determine the fee.
When requested by the holder, a third appraisal may be obtained with the cost shared equally by the holder and the Forest
Service. This third appraisal must meet the same standards of the first and second appraisals and may or may not be accepted
by the authorized officer.

C. Fee Determination:

1. The annual rental fee shall be determined by appraisal and other sound business management principles. (36 CFR
251.57(a)). The fee shall be 5 percent of the appraised fair market fee simple value of the lot for recreation residence
use.

Fees will be predicated on an appraisal of the lot as a base value, and that value will be adjusted in following years
by utilizing the percent of change in the Implicit Price Deflator-Gross National Product (IPD-GNP) index as
of the previous June 30. A fee from a prior year will be adjusted upward or downward, as the case may be, by the percentage
change in the IPD-GNP, except that the maximum annual fee adjustment shall be 10 percent when the IPD-GNP
index exceeds 10 percent in any one year with the amount in excess of 10 percent carried forward to the next succeeding
year where the IPD-GNP index is less than 10 percent. The base rate from which the fee is adjusted will be changed
with each new appraisal of the lot, at least every 20 years.

2. If the holder has received notification that a new permit will not be issued following expiration of this permit,
the annual fee in the tenth year will be taken as the base, and the fee each year during the last 10-year period will be
one-tenth of the base multiplied by the number of years then remaining on the permit. If a new term permit should later
be issued, the holder shall pay the United States the total amount of fees forgone, for the most recent 10-year period
in which the holder has been advised that a new permit will not be issued. This amount may be paid in equal annual installments
over a 10-year period in addition to those fees for existing permits. Such amounts owing will run with the property
and will be charged to any subsequent purchaser of the improvements.

D. Initial Fee: The initial fee may be based on an approved Forest Service appraisal existing at the time of this permit,
with the present day value calculated by applying the IPD-GNP index to the intervening years.

E. Payment Schedule: Based on the criteria stated herein, the initial payment is set at $*

XXXXX

 per year and the fee is due and payable annually on *

XXXXX

 (insert date). Payments will be credited on the date received by the designated collection officer or deposit location.
If the due date(s) for any of the above payments or fee calculation statements fall on a nonworkday, the charges shall
not apply until the close of business of the next workday. Any payments not received within 30 days of the due date shall
be delinquent.

F. Interest and Penalties:

1. A fee owed the United States which is delinquent will be assessed interest based on the most current rate prescribed
by the United States Department of Treasury Financial Manual (TFM-6-8020). Interest shall accrue on
the delinquent fee from the date the fee payment was due and shall remain fixed during the duration of the indebtedness.

2. In addition to interest, certain processing, handling, and administrative costs will be assessed on delinquent
accounts and added to the amounts due.

3. A penalty of 6 percent per year shall be assessed on any indebtedness owing for more than 90 days. This penalty charge
will not be calculated until the 91st day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became delinquent.

4. When a delinquent account is partially paid or made in installments, amounts received shall be applied first to
outstanding penalty and administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest, and third to outstanding principal.

G. Nonpayment Constitutes Breach: Failure of the holder to make the annual payment, penalty, interest, or any other
charges when due shall be grounds for termination of this authorization. However, no permit will be terminated for
nonpayment of any monies owed the United States unless payment of such monies is more than 90 days in arrears.

H. Applicable Law: Delinquent fees and other charges shall be subject to all the rights and remedies afforded the United
States pursuant to federal law and implementing regulations. (31 U.S.C. 3711 

et seq.

)



VII. Transfer, Sale, and Rental



A. Nontransferability: Except as provided in this section, this permit is not transferable.

B. Transferability Upon Death of the Holder:

1. If the holder of this permit is a married couple and one spouse dies, this permit will continue in force, without amendment
or revision, in the name of the surviving spouse.

2. If the holder of this permit is an individual who dies during the term of this permit and there is no surviving spouse,
an annual renewable permit will be issued, upon request, to the executor or administrator of the holder's estate.
Upon settlement of the estate, a new permit incorporating current Forest Service policies and procedures will be
issued for the remainder of the deceased holder's term to the properly designated heir(s) as shown by an order of a court,
bill of sale, or other evidence to be the owner of the improvements.

C. Divestiture of Ownership: If the holder through voluntary sale, transfer, enforcement of contract, foreclosure,
or other legal proceeding shall cease to be the owner of the physical improvements, this permit shall be terminated.
If the person to whom title to said improvements is transferred is deemed by the authorizing officer to be qualified
as a holder, then such person to whom title has been transferred will be granted a new permit. Such new permit will be
for the remainder of the term of the original holder.


D. Notice to Prospective Purchasers: When considering a voluntary sale of the recreation residence, the holder shall
provide a copy of this special use permit to the prospective purchaser before finalizing the sale. The holder cannot
make binding representations to the purchasers as to whether the Forest Service will reauthorize the occupancy.

E. Rental: The holder may rent or sublet the use of improvements covered under this permit only with the express written
permission of the authorized officer. In the event of an authorized rental or sublet, the holder shall continue to
be responsible for compliance with all conditions of this permit by persons to whom such premises may be sublet.



VIII. Revocation



A. Revocation for Cause: This permit may be revoked for cause by the authorized officer upon breach of any of the terms
and conditions of this permit or applicable law. Prior to such revocation for cause, the holder shall be given notice
and provided a reasonable time_not to exceed ninety (90) days_within which to correct the breach.

B. Revocation in the Public Interest During the Permit Term:

1. This permit may be revoked during its term at the discretion of the authorized officer for reasons in the public interest.
(36 CFR 251.60(b.) In the event of such revocation in the public interest, the holder shall be given one hundred and
eighty (180) days' prior written notice to vacate the premises, provided that the authorized officer may prescribe
a date for a shorter period in which to vacate (``prescribed vacancy date'') if the public interest objective reasonably
requires the lot in a shorter period of time.

2. The Forest Service and the holder agree that in the event of a revocation in the public interest, the holder shall
be paid damages. Revocation in the public interest and payment of damages is subject to the availability of funds or
appropriations.

a. Damages in the event of a public interest revocation shall be the lesser amount of either (1) the cost of relocation
of the approved improvements to another lot which may be authorized for residential occupancy (but not including
the costs of damages incidental to the relocation which are caused by the negligence of the holder or a third party),
or (2) the replacement costs of the approved improvements as of the date of revocation. Replacement cost shall be determined
by the Forest Service utilizing standard appraisal procedures giving full consideration to the improvement's condition,
remaining economic life and location, and shall be the estimated cost to construct, at current prices, a building
with utility equivalent to the building being appraised using modern materials and current standards, design and
layout as of the date of revocation. If revocation in the public interest occurs after the holder has received notification
that a new permit will not be issued following expiration of the current permit, then the amount of damages shall be
adjusted as of the date of revocation by multiplying the replacement cost by a fraction which has as the numerator the
number of full months remaining to the term of the permit prior to revocation (measured from the date of the notice of
revocation) and as the denominator, the total number of months in the original term of the permit.

b. The amount of the damages determined in accordance with paragraph a. above shall be fixed by mutual agreement between
the authorized officer and the holder and shall be accepted by the holder in full satisfaction of all claims against
the United States under this clause: 

Provided, 

That if mutual agreement is not reached, the authorized officer shall determine the amount and if the holder is dissatisfied
with the amount to be paid may appeal the determination in accordance with the Appeal Regulations (36 CFR 251.80) and
the amount as determined on appeal shall be final and conclusive on the parties hereto: 

Provided further. 

That upon the payment to the holder of the amount fixed by the authorized officer, the right of the Forest Service to
remove or require the removal of the improvements shall not be stayed pending final decision on appeal.



IX. Issuance of a New Permit



A. Decisions to issue a new permit or convert the permitted area to an alternative public use upon termination of this
permit require a determination of consistency with the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest plan).

1. Where continued use is consistent with the Forest plan, the authorized officer shall issue a new permit, in accordance
with applicable requirements for environmental documentation.

2. If, as a result of an amendment or revision of the Forest plan, the permitted area is within an area allocated to an
alternative public use, the authorized officer shall conduct a site specific project analysis to determine the range
and intensity of the alternative public use.

a. If the project analysis results in a finding that the use of the lot for a recreation residence may continue, the holder
shall be notified in writing, this permit shall be modified as necessary, and a new term permit shall be issued following
expiration of the current permit.

decision document.

c. A deci
