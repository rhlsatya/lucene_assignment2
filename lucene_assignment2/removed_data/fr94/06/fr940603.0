FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM











Membership of State Banking Institutions in the Federal Reserve System



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Board is amending Regulation H to allow a state member bank that meets certain conditions to invest in its premises
in an amount up to 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital without obtaining specific approval. The Board believes that a general
approval for a state member bank to invest an amount not exceeding 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital is appropriate for
a bank that meets those conditions. This action will significantly reduce the number of applications to invest in
bank premises that are filed with the Board and will thereby reduce regulatory burden.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 371d, requires a state member bank to obtain the approval of the Board
to invest in the bank's premises if the aggregate level of direct and indirect investment in its premises will exceed
the bank's capital stock account. Section 24A applies



(1) To investments in bank premises and to investments in the stock, bonds, debentures, or other such obligations
of any corporation holding the premises of such bank,

(2) To the making of loans to or upon the security of the stock of any such corporation; and

(3) To the indebtedness incurred by any corporation that is an affiliate of the bank.

The Board is amending Regulation H to allow a state member board that meets certain conditions to invest in bank premises
in an amount that exceeds its capital stock account but not exceeding 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital without obtaining
specific approval for the investment. Prior to this amendment, a state member bank was required to obtain Board approval
for each investment in bank premises if the aggregate investment exceeded, or would exceed, the capital stock account
of the state member bank.

The Board believes that investments by a state member bank in bank premises in an amount in excess of its stock account
but not exceeding 50 percent of the bank's Tier 1 capital generally do not present any significant risks to the bank
if the bank is well capitalized, is rated CAMEL ``1'' or ``2'', and is not subject to any written agreement, cease and
desist order, capital directive. The Board believes that a general approval for a state member bank to invest an amount
not exceed 50 percent of its Tier 1 capital its appropriate for a bank that meets those conditions. This action will
significantly reduce the number of applications to invest in bank premises that are filed with the Board and will thereby
reduce regulatory burden. The amendment does not affect state member banks' ability to invest in bank premises, without
conditions, up to the amount of their capital stock account.



Notice and Public Participation



The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) relating to notice and public participation have not been followed in connection
with the adoption of this amendment because the changes relate to rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.



Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Board certifies that the proposed amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. The proposed amendment will reduce the regulatory burden for many small depository institutions
by relieving them of the requirement to file an application in certain cases, and will have no effect in other cases.

Special Conditions: Modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 Series Airplanes, High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final special conditions; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These special conditions are issued for AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes modified by Duncan Aviation, Inc., of Lincoln,
Nebraska. These airplanes are equipped with digital electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) that perform critical
functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection
of the EFIS from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional
safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by
these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Comments Invited




The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance; however,
interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address
specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the
Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted
will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date
for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking
will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response
to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: '`Comments to Docket No. NM-96.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.


Background


On April 15, 1994, Duncan Aviation, Inc., of Lincoln, Nebraska, applied for a supplemental type certificate to modify
the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes. The AMD/BA Falcon 50 is a business jet with three aft-mounted turbojet engines.
The airplane can carry two pilots and 8 to 19 passengers, depending on the exit and interior configuration, and is capable
of operating to an altitude of 45,000 feet. The proposed modification incorporates the installation of digital avionics
consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) that is potentially vulnerable to high-intensity radiated
fields (HIRF) external to the airplane.


Supplemental Type Certification Basis


Under the provisions of  21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Duncan Aviation, Inc., must show
that the altered AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes continue to meet the applicable provisions of the regulations
incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A46EU, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application
for the change. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the
``original type certification basis.''
The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A46EU include the following for the AMD/BA Falcon
50 series:  21.29 of part 21, and 14 CFR part 25, dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25-1 through
25-34. In addition the following regulations apply to the EFIS installation:   25.1303(b) and
25.1322, as amended through Amendment 25-38; and   25.1309, 25.1321(a), (b), (d), and (e), 25.1331,
25.1333, and 25.1335, as amended by Amendment 25-41. These special conditions will form an additional part
of the supplemental type certification basis.
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain
adequate or appropriate safety standards for the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual design
feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of  21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent
to that established in the regulations.
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by   11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with  21.101(b)(2).

Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the applicant apply for
a supplemental type certificate to modify any other model included on the same type certificate to incorporate the
same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions
of  21.101(a)(1).


Discussion


There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from
high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing
use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide
adequate protection.


To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference,
special conditions are needed for the modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes that would require that the EFIS
be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of HIRF.



High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF)



When the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite
communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics
systems, such as the EFIS, to HIRF must be established.

It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment
through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate
level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs
1 or 2 below:

1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18 GHz.

a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe
shielding.

b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis.

2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated.






The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions
in other certification projects. It is based on new data and SAE AE4R subcommittee recommendations. This revised
envelope includes data from Western Europe and the U.S.

As discussed above, these special conditions are applicable to the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes, modified by
Duncan Aviation. Should Duncan Aviation apply at a later date for a supplemental type certificate to modify any other
model included on Type Certificate No. A46EU to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special
conditions would apply to that model as well, under the provisions of  21.101(a)(1).



Conclusion



This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes. It is not
a rule of general applicability and affects only the applicant who applied to the FAA for approval of these features
on the airplane.

The substance of the special conditions for these airplanes has been subjected to the notice and comment procedure
in several prior instances and has been derived without substantive change from those previously issued. It is unlikely
that prior public comment would result in a significant change from the substance contained herein. For this reason,
and because a delay would significantly affect the certification of the airplane, which is imminent, the FAA has determined
that prior public notice and comment are unnecessary and impracticable, and good cause exists for adopting these
special conditions immediately. Therefore, these special conditions are being made effective upon issuance. The
FAA is requesting comments to allow interested persons to submit views that may not have been submitted in response
to the prior opportunities for comment described above.

issued as part of the supplemental type certification basis for the modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes:

1. 

Protection from Unwanted Effects of High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF). 

Each electrical and electronic system that performs critical functions must be designed and installed to ensure
that the operation and operational capability of these systems to perform critical functions are not adversely affected
when the airplane is exposed to high-intensity radiated fields external to the airplane.

2. The following definition applies with respect to this special condition: 

Critical Function. 

Functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure condition that would prevent the continued safe flight
and landing of the airplane. Issued in Renton, Washington, on May 24, 1994.

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series
airplanes, that currently requires modification of the belly fairing structure. This amendment revises the compliance
time for accomplishment of the modification. This amendment is prompted by the fact that the compliance time of the
existing rule would have allowed operators of low-cycle airplanes to accomplish the modification at a time considerably
later than that intended. The requirements of this amendment are intended to ensure that the structural integrity
of the belly fairing structure is maintained. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 93-24-11, Amendment
39-8760 (58 FR 64875, December 10, 1993), which is applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 2, 1994 (59 FR 4869). The action proposed to supersede AD 93-24-11 to continue to require modification
of the belly fairing structure, but to revise the compliance time for accomplishing the modification. That action
was prompted by the fact that the compliance time currently specified in paragraph (a) of AD 93-24-11 could
allow certain operators to accomplish the modification at a time considerably later than that intended. The proposal
proposed to revise the compliance time to ``prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or
within 300 days after the effective date of the final rule, whichever occurs later.'' This compliance time will ensure
that the structural integrity of the belly fairing structure is maintained in a timely manner. 




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the three comments received. 


All commenters support the proposed rule. 


After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 


The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry were affected by AD 93-24-11, and will continue to
be affected by this supersedure of that AD. It will take approximately 288 work hours per airplane to accomplish the
actions currently required by AD 93-24-11, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $1,045 per airplane. Based on these figures, the current cost impact of AD 93-24-11
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $337,700, or $16, 885 per airplane. 


The total cost impact figure discussed above is presented as if no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements
of AD 93-24-11 (or this supersedure of that AD). There are no foreseeable additional costs that will be
imposed by this supersedure of AD 93-24-11. 


The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) amends its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection with
the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The regulations provide that the fees will be based
on the salaries of the employees who ordinarily perform the searches.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the
processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication,
and review. The fees previously provided for in  200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing
requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. The Board is amending
its regulation to update the fees by establishing criteria for determining fees so that the fees will automatically
change with changes in Federal salaries. In addition, the Board is increasing the fees found in section 200.4(g) and
is adding a new paragraph to provide a charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.



On January 14, 1994, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule (59 FR 2317), inviting comments on or before February
14, 1994. No comments were received. The final rule differs from the proposed rule in that we have deleted specific
salary amounts to be assessed for search and review and substituted therefor language that will allow these fees to
rise with salary rate increases. Also the maximum computer search charge has been reduced from that in the proposed
rule in accordance with more current information.

The Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that this is not a significant
regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.
There are no information collections associated with this rule.

of synthetic iron oxide as a color additive in human food, specifically sausage casings.


FDA gave interested persons until April 6, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received
no objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA has concluded that the final rule published
in the 

Federal Register

 of March 7, 1994, should be confirmed.

Anorectal Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Final Monograph



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule with opportunity for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule amending the monograph for over-the-counter (OTC)
anorectal drug products. This amendment updates the monograph to incorporate a United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.)
name change for an active ingredient included in the monograph. This final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC
drug products conducted by FDA.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of August 3, 1990 (55 FR 31776), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products (21 CFR part 346). That
monograph included ``Hamamelis water, `The National Formulary XI''' as an active ingredient in  346.18(b).
``Hamamelis water'' was also cited in   346.50 (b)(2)(vi) and (d)(8). Because Hamamelis water had last
been included in an official compendium in The National Formulary XI (Ref. 1), it was named in this manner in  346.18(b).



In 1993 (Refs. 2 and 3), Hamamelis water was proposed for inclusion in U.S.P. XXIII, which becomes official on January
1, 1995. The proposed official name was subsequently changed from ``Hamamelis water'' to ``Witch Hazel'' (Ref. 3).
To be consistent with the change in compendial status and to give manufacturers advance notice of the need for revised
labeling, the agency is changing the name of the ingredient ``Hamamelis water'' to ``witch hazel'' in the final monograph
for OTC anorectal drug products. These changes will occur in  346.18(b) in the ingredient listing and in  346.50
in the introductory text of paragraphs (b)(2)(vi) and (d)(8). These changes will become effective on January 1, 1995.

The amendment will require revised product labeling to substitute witch hazel for hamamelis water. This labeling
revision represents a minor clarifying change that does not change the substance of the labeling requirements contained
in the final regulations. Because sections 502 (e)(1) and (e)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.
352 (e)(1) and (e)(3)) require the established name of a drug to be used, any ``witch hazel'' drug product initially
introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce after January 1, 1995, will need to
bear the new established name ``witch hazel.''

As noted previously, these changes make the final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products consistent with a change
being implemented in the official compendium (U.S.P.). Because the name change follows from a U.S.P. change, the
Commissioner has determined that notice and comment are unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553(b); 21 CFR 10.40(e)(1)). Therefore,
publication of this document constitutes final action on these changes under the Administrative Procedure Act (5
U.S.C. 553). This final rule shall become effective on January 1, 1995.

FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. In this final rule, the labeling change could be implemented by manufacturers at
very little cost at the next printing of labels. There are only a few manufacturers of products containing this ingredient.
Accordingly, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

The agency invites public comment regarding any economic impact that this rulemaking would have on the labeling of
OTC drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with relabeling. Comments
regarding the impact of this final rule on OTC drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.
The agency will consider any comments to determine whether the regulation should subsequently be modified.

Interested persons may, on or before August 17, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted
on or before August 17, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may
be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54458), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC astringent skin protectant drug products (21
CFR part 347, subpart A). That monograph included ``Hamamelis water, U.S.P.'' as an active ingredient in  347.10(c).
``Hamamelis water'' was also cited in   347.50(b)(3) and (d)(3). The designation ``U.S.P.'' was included
in  347.10(c) because the agency anticipated that a final compendial (U.S.P.) monograph would be established
for the ingredient prior to the effective date of the final monograph for OTC astringent skin protectant drug products
(58 FR 54458 at 54460). Hamamelis water had last been included in an official compendium in The National 
Formulary XI (Ref. 1). 


In 1993 (Refs. 2 and 3), Hamamelis water was proposed for inclusion in U.S.P. XXIII, which becomes official on January
1, 1995. The proposed official name was subsequently changed from ``Hamamelis water'' to ``Witch Hazel'' (Ref. 3).
To be consistent with the change in compendial status and to give manufacturers advance notice of the need for revised
labeling, the agency is changing the name of the ingredient ``Hamamelis water'' to ``witch hazel'' in the final monograph
for OTC astringent skin protectant drug products. These changes will occur in  347.10(c) in the ingredient
listing and in  347.50 in the introductory text of paragraphs (b)(3), (c)(2), and (d)(3). These changes will
become effective on January 1, 1995.
The amendment will require revised product labeling to substitute witch hazel for hamamelis water. This labeling
revision represents a minor clarifying change that does not change the substance of the labeling requirements contained
in the final regulations. Because sections 502(e)(1) and (e)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.

SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the approval, with two exceptions, of a program amendment submitted by Kansas as a modification
to the State's permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Kansas program) under the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment pertains to definitions, administrative hearing procedure,
civil penalties, use of explosives, standards for revegetation success, postmining land use, and inspection and
enforcement.



The amendment is intended to revise the State program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal standards,
to clarify ambiguities, and to improve operational efficiency.

I. Background on the Kansas Program



On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Kansas program. General background
information on the Kansas program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions
of approval of the Kansas program can be found in the January 21, 1981, 

Federal Register

 (46 FR 5892). Subsequent actions concerning Kansas's program and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR 916.12,
916.15, and 916.16.

II. Submission of Amendment


By letter dated September 14, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KS-567), Kansas submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Kansas submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying, in part,
required program amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c) that were placed on the Kansas program on October 7, 1988
(53 FR 39467, 39470), September 13, 1991 (56 FR 46548), and June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32847, 32855).
OSM published a notice in the September 27, 1993, 

Federal Register

 announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment (58 FR 50302).
The public comment period ended October 27, 1993. The public hearing scheduled for October 22, 1993, was not held because
no one requested an opportunity to testify.
During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns related to the Kansas Administrative Regulations (K.A.R.)
47-4-14a(c)(7), regarding intervention, K.A.R. 47-4-14a (d)(10)(D) and (d)(5)(B)(vi)
regarding public hearings, K.A.R. 47-5-5a (a) and (b) regarding civil penalties, K.A.R. 47-5-5a(b)(14)
regarding the definition of ``violation, failure or refusal,'' and K.A.R. 47-15-1a(b)(21) regarding
inspection and enforcement, substitution of terms.
OSM notified Kansas of these concerns by letter dated January 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-574).
Kansas responded in a letter dated March 9, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-575), by submitting further
revisions to Articles 4, 5, 6, 9, and 15 of the Kansas Administrative Regulations. On March 10, 1994 (Administrative
Record No. KS-581), Kansas requested further information from OSM regarding its proposed amendment. Subsequently,
Kansas again, in a letter dated March 10, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-576), revised its proposed amendment.
OSM reopened the public comment period on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14811). The public comment period closed on April 14,
1994.


III. Director's Findings


After a thorough review, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, the Director finds,
with two exceptions, that the proposed amendment as submitted by Kansas on September 14, 1993, meets the requirements
of SMCRA and 30 CFR chapter VII.


1. Provisions Not Discussed


Kansas proposes certain revisions to its rules that involve minor typographical corrections and recodification.
The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective in
meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations and is approving them.


2. Required Program Amendments


Kansas submitted proposed revisions in response to required program amendments that the Director placed on the Kansas
program, codified in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 916.16 (a), (b) and (c). The Director finds that the following
proposed State regulations satisfy the required program amendments, are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements
than the Federal regulations indicated in each required program amendment, and is approving them (the codified required
amendments at 30 CFR 916.16 are indicated in brackets): K.A.R. 47-4-14a(c)(7) by requiring that a person
petitioning for leave to intervene in a proceeding need only show why his interest is or may be adversely affected rather
than why his interest would be adversely affected and by requiring the presiding officer to make a decision to grant
intervention based on factors listed at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(c)(7)(B)(i)-(iv) in the event subsection
(7)(A)(i) or (7)(A)(ii) are not applicable [30 CFR 916.16(b)(8)]; K.A.R. 47-4-14a(c)(11) by providing
that any person that fails to file a responsive pleading by the required time 

may

 be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing [30 CFR 916.16(b)(10)]; K.A.R. 47-4-14a (b), (d), and (d)(2)(F)
by replacing the phrase ``this act'' with the phrase ``these rules and regulations,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(2)]; K.A.R.
47-5-5a (a) and (b), (a)(8), (a)(10) and (b)(14)-(20) by replacing the identified Federal terms
and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations and by providing the State address where an individual
may file a petition for review [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 47-5-5a(b)(14) by replacing Federal terms
and citations with the appropriate State terms and citations [30 CFR 916.16(b)(24)]; K.A.R. 47-5-5a(c)(7)(C)
by imposing a 30-day time limit within which the Surface Mining Section must remit a refund [30 CFR 916.16(c)(3)];
K.A.R. 47-6-7(h)(2) by correcting an improper reference from K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(14) to
K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(14) [30 CFR 916.16(b)(30)]; K.A.R. 47-9-1 (c)(17) and (d)(17) by modifying
the adoption by reference of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61 by deleting from its adoption by reference of
30 CFR 816-817.61(c)(1) everything but the statement ``all blasting operations shall be conducted under the
direction of a certified blaster,'' [30 CFR 916.16(c)(4)]; K.A.R. 47-9-1 (c)(46) and (d)(44) by deleting
paragraph (d), concerning variances for steep slope mining, from its adoption by reference of 30 CFR 816-817.133
[30 CFR 916.16(a)]; K.A.R. 47-15-1a by removing the incorrect reference to K.A.R. 47-15-5a
from the section heading for K.A.R. 47-15-1a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(5)]; K.A.R. 47-15-1a(b) (6)
and (9) by providing the correct counterpart State citations for the terms ``43 CFR Part 4'' and ``43 CFR 4.1281,''
[30 CFR 916.16(c)(7)]; and K.A.R. 47-47-15-1a(b)(21) by requiring that informal public hearings
be conducted in accordance with K.A.R. 47-4-14a [30 CFR 916.16(c)(6)].
Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program amendments as identified above from the Kansas program
and as codified at 30 CFR 916.16.


3. K.A.R. 47-2-75(e)(6), Definitions


Kansas proposes to revise K.A.R. 47-2-75(e)(6) to replace the reference in the Federal regulations at
30 CFR 846.5 to section 703 of SMCRA which deals with employee protection, with a reference to Kansas Statute Annotated
(K.S.A.) 75-2973 which also deals with employee protection. Kansas is submitting this revision in response
to a required program amendment placed on the Kansas program at 30 CFR 916.16(c)(1).

The Director finds that Kansas' proposed amendment does not render the State provision at K.A.R. 47-2-75(e)(6)
less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal provision at 30 CFR 846.5 and is approving it. Accordingly,
the Director is removing the required program amendment at 30 CFR 916.16(c)(1). 


4. K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E) (iii) and (iv), Notice of Administrative Hearings 


Kansas proposes to revise K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iii) and add K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iv)
so that the rules would read as follows: 

 

(E) The state agency shall cause notice to be given to any other person entitled to notice under any other provisions
of law, who has not been given notice under section (d)(6)(A), as follows: 
(iii) Notice under this subsection may include all types of information provided in sections (d)(6) (A) through (D)
or may consist of a brief statement indicating the subject matter, parties, time, place where the hearing will be held,
locations where the general public may meet for hearings which are conducted electronically, nature of the hearing,
manner in which copies of the notice to the parties may be inspected and copied, and the name and telephone number of
the presiding officer. 
(iv) The surface mining section shall also post notice of the hearing at their office and, where practicable, publish
it in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the mine at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing. 
Kansas proposes these revisions in response to a required program amendment placed on the Kansas program at 30 CFR
916.16(b)(17) that instructed Kansas to remove the provisions that allowed for the holding of hearings by telephone
or other electronic means. The required program amendment resulted from a finding published in a 

Federal Register

 notice dated September 13, 1991 (56 FR 46531, 46538). The finding concluded that the proposal to conduct hearings
by telephone or other electronic means conflicted with existing SMCRA and State requirements for public hearings.


Id. 

See also 58 FR 32850-32851 (June 14, 1993). 



The proposed revision at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iii) insures, among other things, that the notice
of an administrative hearing provided to non-parties will notify members of the general public where they may go to
participate in an electronically conducted hearing. Moreover, the proposed language at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iv)
requires the Surface Mining Section to post such notices at its office, so that members of the general public have access
to one central location where they can always obtain information about upcoming hearings. 
The proposed language at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) also provides that, ``where practicable,''
the Surface Mining Section will publish the notice in a newspaper or general circulation in the area of the mine at least
seven (7) days prior to the hearing. As a general rule this proposed 7-day publication notice is not inconsistent with
SMCRA or the Federal rules because SMCRA does not uniformly require regulatory authorities to publish advance notice
of all hearings. However, there are instances where SMCRA and other provisions of the Kansas program specifically
require the regulatory authority to publish advance notice of a hearing. Moreover, in those specific instances,
the regulatory authority is required to publish such notice more than seven days in advance of the hearing date. See
section 513(b) of SMCRA; 30 CFR 773.13(c)(2)(ii). See also K.A.R. 47-3-42(a)(43) (incorporating by
reference 30 CFR 773.13). 
The Director is approving the proposed rule at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E)(iv) with the understanding
that it is a general rule and that in any particular instance where a more specific rule of the Kansas program requires
publication of advance notice of an administrative hearing, the more specific rule must take precedence over this
proposed general rule. 
The Director finds that the proposed rules at K.A.R. 47-4-14a(d)(6)(E) (iii) and (vi) are not inconsistent
with SMCRA and the Federal program and is approving them. Accordingly, the Director is removing the required program
amendment from the Kansas program and as codified at 30 CFR 916.16(b)(17).

5. K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) and (d)(3), Permit Revisions



Kansas proposes to modify K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) and (d)(3) by adding the word ``significant'' so that the rules
would read: 




(d) No application for a 

signficant 

revision shall be approved unless the applicant demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds that: 
(1) the reclamation required by the state act and the regulatory program can be accomplished; 
(2) applicable requirements under K.A.R. 47-3-42(a)(43) pertinent to the revision are met; and 
(3) the application for 

a significant 

revision complies with all requirements of the state act and the regulatory program. 




Prior to the proposed amendments, the State provisions at K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) and (d)(3) were substantively
similar to the counterpart Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c). 

The proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47-6-2-(d) and (d)(3) render the State provisions less effective
in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c) because, as revised, the State provisions
would apply the approval criteria of K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) only to significant permit revisions. In contrast,
the Federal regulations require that such approval criteria apply to 

all 

permit revisions. Therefore, the Director finds Kansas' proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) and
(d)(3) to be less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 774.13(c) and is
not approving it. 



6. K.A.R. 47-9-1(c)(43) Revegetation: Standards for Success, Surface Mining Activities, and K.A.R.
47-9-1(d)(39) Revegetation: Standards for Success, Underground Mining Activities 



Kansas proposes to add a subsection (3) to 30 CFR 816/817.116(A) that would read: 




(3) Data being used for bond release will be submitted to the surface mining section annually. This includes data for
the last augmented seeding which will start the extended liability period. The following timetable for submissions
shall be followed: (i) The planting reports including soil tests shall be submitted by March 31 of the year following
the year in which they were performed. (ii) The production and ground cover data shall be submitted within 30 days of
the date they were sampled. Ground cover must include species identification. Raw field data may be submitted at this
time to fulfill this requirement. The tabulated results will then be submitted by March 31 of the following year. (iii)
All data must be clearly identified as to the bond release management area that it represents. 




While the Federal regulations do not provide similar detailed requirements regarding submission of data used for
bond release, as the above-quoted proposed Kansas provision, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR
730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations
on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal
regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls
and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section
505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with
the Federal program. 

Therefore, the Director is approving Kansas' proposed revisions at K.A.R. 47-9-1(c)(43) and 47-9-1(d)(39).



7. K.A.R. 47-9-1(f)(2). Special Permanent Program Performance Standards_Operations on Prime Farmlands




Kansas proposes to adopt by reference the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.11, including 30 CFR 823.11(a) that addresses
exemptions to prime farmland performance standards and which was previously deleted from the Kansas program. Kansas
expressed its desire to readopt 30 CFR 823.11(a) in its letter dated March 10, 1994.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00017 </DOCNO>

The Federal provision at 30 CFR 823.11(a) applies to surface and underground mines alike and exempts from compliance
with the special prime farmland performance standards ``[c]oal preparation plants, support facilities, and roads
* * * that are actively used over extended periods of time * * * where such uses affect
a minimal amount of land.'' On October 1, 1984, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia remanded
30 CFR 823.11(a) in 

In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation,

 21 ERC 1724, 15 ELR 20481 (D.D.C. 1984), for two reasons. First, the Court found that OSM had failed to adequately consider
and discuss the basic differences between underground and surface mining operations when it applied the exemption
at 30 CFR 823.11(a) to surface, as well as underground, mines. 

Id., 

21 ERC at 1734-1735. Second, the Court found that OSM had not provided enough guidance regarding the scope of
the exemption:




The Secretary has provided no indication of what he considers an extended period of time or a minimum amount of land.






Id., 

21 ERC at 1735.



On February 21, 1985, in response to the Court's October 1, 1984, decision, OSM suspended 30 CFR 823.11(a) insofar
as the exemption therein relates to facilities used in surface, as opposed to underground, mining (50 FR 7274, 7277).
With regard to facilities used in underground mining, OSM stated that the exemption at 30 CFR 823.11(a) remained applicable,
but that OSM intended to propose rules to clarify the scope of the exemption. OSM did propose such rules on March 25,
1987 (52 FR 9644). However, after considering comments regarding the proposed rules, OSM determined that it lacked
sufficient data to support the promulgation of a specific spatial limitation on the exemption (53 FR 40828, 40835
(October 18, 1988)). Therefore, OSM postponed rulemaking pending further study. 

Id. 

OSM stated that existing 30 CFR 823.11(a), as modified by the February 21, 1985, suspension notice, was to be retained
in the interim. 

Id. 

Between the time OSM published proposed rules and later determined that final rulemaking had to be postponed to allow
further study, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, on January 29, 1988, affirmed the ruling of the District
Court concerning the remand of 30 CFR 823.11(a). 

National Wildlife Federation 

v. 

Hodel, 

839 F.2d 694, 722-723 (D.C. Cir. 1988).

At the present time then, 30 CFR 823.11(a) is suspended insofar as it relates to surface, as opposed to underground,
mining. Therefore, Kansas' proposal to adopt 30 CFR 823.11(a), as applied to surface mining, is inconsistent with
SMCRA, as interpreted by court decisions. Moreover, with regard to underground mining, the Kansas proposal is inconsistent
with SMCRA, as interpreted by court decisions, because it fails to adequately explain what is an extended period of
time or a minimal amount of land. Accordingly, the Director cannot approve the proposed adoption of 30 CFR 823.11(a)
at K.A.R. 47-9-1(f)(2).



IV. Public and Agency Comments



Public Comments



For a complete history of the opportunity provided for public comment on the proposed amendment, please refer to ``Submission
of Amendment.'' No public comments were received.



Agency Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from the Administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Kansas program.

By letter dated April 8, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-579), the Soil Conservation Service responded
that it had no comment.

By letter dated April 12, 1994 (Administrative Record No. KS-580), the Fish and Wildlife Service responded
that it had no comment.
Comments were also solicited from various State agencies but none elected to comment.


Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence


Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), concurrence was solicited from the EPA for those aspects of the proposed amendment
that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air
Act.
By letter dated November 2, 1993 (Administrative Record No. KS-571), the EPA regional office in Kansas City,
Kansas responded that it did not have any comments regarding the proposed revisions.


State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Comments (ACHP)


30 CFR 732.17(h)(4) requires that all amendments that may have an effect on historic properties be provided to the
SHPO and ACHP for comment. Comments were solicited from these offices. No comments were received from either SHPO
or ACHP.


V. Director's Decision


Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the proposed amendment submitted by Kansas on September 14,
1993, as modified on March 9, and March 10, 1994, with two exceptions.
The Director is not approving proposed rules K.A.R. 47-6-2(d) and (d)(3), Permit revisions, as discussed
in finding No. 5 and K.A.R. 47-9-1(f)(2), Special permanent program performance standards_operations
on prime farmlands_applicability, as discussed in finding No. 7.
Except as noted above, the Director is approving the Kansas regulations with the provision that they be fully promulgated
in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 916 codifying decisions concerning the Kansas program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.


VI. Effect of Director's Decision


Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight
of the Kansas program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations, and other materials approved
by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives, and other materials, and will require the
enforcement by Kansas of only such provisions.


VII. Procedural Determinations


Compliance With Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

Compliance With Executive Order 12866



This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).



Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act



No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).



Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.



Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form an amendment to 31 CFR part 356, published
as a final rule on January 5, 1993 (58 FR 412). 31 CFR part 356, also referred to as the uniform offering circular, sets
out terms and conditions for the sale and issue by the Department to the public of marketable book-entry Treasury bills,
notes and bonds. The amendment contained herein allows for Treasury securities awarded to a submitter that is a member
of a clearing corporation to be delivered to an account of the clearing corporation at a depository institution, provided
the securities are for the submitter's own account and certain agreements have been executed by the parties and filed
with the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank. Specifically, this change will enable a clearing corporation to net securities
awarded at an auction to submitters that are its members with the when-issued and secondary market trades of such members
in the same securities.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background and Analysis 



Clearing corporations play an increasingly important role in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
To date, clearing corporation involvement in the clearance and settlement of Treasury securities has been limited
to the secondary market. The Department believes that including Treasury auction purchases in a multilateral netting
system operated by a clearing agency registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') can be beneficial
to the efficiency of the government securities market. For example, with respect to the book-entry system for Treasury
securities, it can reduce the number of securities transfers. In addition, it can enable the clearing agency to improve
its risk management by providing a more complete picture of its members' positions. 

This amendment to the uniform offering circular specifies the conditions under which Federal Reserve Banks may deliver
to an account of a clearing corporation at a depository institution securities awarded at auction to submitters that
are members of the clearing corporation. The amendment permits only securities awarded to a submitter for its own
account to be delivered through a clearing corporation. To qualify as a clearing corporation for purposes of this
rule, an entity must be registered with the SEC as a clearing agency. 

Currently, the only SEC-registered clearing agency that nets trades in Treasury securities is the Government Securities
Clearing Corporation (``GSCC''). GSCC has proposed to net GSCC netting member auction awards of Treasury securities
against their when-issued and secondary market trades in the same securities. On March 10, 1994, the SEC published
the GSCC's proposed rule amendments necessary to implement the netting of the proprietary auction awards of its members
(59 FR 11345). The SEC comment period ended on March 31, 1994. 

This rule amends   356.2, 356.11, 356.16, and 356.24 of the uniform offering circular. 

Specifically, in  356.2, the definition of the term ``autocharge agreement'' has been expanded to allow for
an autocharge between a clearing corporation and a depository institution. In addition, the term ``clearing corporation''
is defined as a clearing agency, as defined by  3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that is registered with
the SEC. 

The term ``delivery and payment agreement'' has also been added to the definitions in  356.2. This term refers
to an agreement between a submitter and a clearing corporation authorizing a Federal Reserve Bank to deliver securities
awarded to a submitter to, and accept payment from, a depository institution for the clearing corporation. This new
agreement is needed to authorize the delivery of securities to a clearing corporation's account rather than to the
submitter's account. Any existing autocharge agreements between a submitter and a depository institution will
continue to govern delivery and payment for submitters not taking delivery through a clearing corporation. In addition,
any existing autocharge agreements will continue to govern the delivery of and payment for securities awarded to
customers. 

New paragraph 356.11(b)(2) makes clear that for competitive bids submitted in paper form, a submitter that is a clearing
corporation member and is submitting bids for its own account and for customers must submit a separate tender for each
specific delivery instruction. This requirement also applies to any other submitter instructing delivery of awarded
securities to more than one account.

New paragraph 356.16(b)(2)(iii) has been added to clarify that, if awarded securities are to be delivered to an account
of a clearing corporation at a depository institution, a delivery and payment agreement must be acknowledged by,
and on file with, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank prior to the submission of a tender for the securities. By entering
into such an agreement, the submitter authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank to provide to the clearing corporation
notice of the submitter's auction awards. Further, a clearing corporation entering into delivery and payment agreements
with submitters must have an acknowledged autocharge agreement on file at the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the
accounts of the clearing corporation's agent banks. By entering into an autocharge agreement, the clearing corporation
authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank to provide the depository institution whose funds account will be charged on
issuance notice of certain payment related information for securities to be delivered. 

Finally, paragraph 356.24(a) has been expanded to provide that, if securities are to be delivered to an account of
a clearing corporation at a depository institution, notice of awards will be provided to the clearing corporation.
Also, paragraph 356.24(c) has been modified to correspond to the expanded definition of autocharge agreement. 



II. Special Analysis 



This final rule does not meet the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action'' pursuant to Executive Order 12866.


Because this rule relates to public contracts and procedures for United States securities, the notice, public comment,
and delayed effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are inapplicable, pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
553(a)(2). 

In addition, because this rule is in the public interest, expedites the handling and processing of government securities,
offers a new option for delivery and payment of securities, and does not adversely affect holders of government securities,
the Department has determined not to publish the rule for public comment and to make the rule effective immediately
upon publication. 

As no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 

et seq.

) do not apply.

Special Local Regulation; Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display, Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A special local regulation is being adopted for the Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display. This event will be held
on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY on July 3, 1994 with a rain date of July 9, 1994. This regulation will restrict general navigation
on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY. Due to the large number of spectator vessels and the falling ash and debris from the fireworks
display, this regulation is needed to provide for the safety of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during
the event.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold this event was not received by the Commander, Ninth
Coast Guard District, until May 2, 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish a proposed rule in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.


Drafting Information


The drafter of this regulation is Scott J. Smith, Lieutenant Junior Grade, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Officer, Aids
to Navigation & Waterways Management Branch and Karen E. Lloyd, Lieutenant, U.S. Coast Guard, Project Attorney,
Ninth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Discussion of Regulation


The Thomas Graves Memorial Fireworks Display will be conducted on Lake Ontario, Port Bay, NY on July 3, 1994. This regulation
will restrict general navigation on Lake Ontario, Port Bay Harbor, in a 500 foot zone surrounding a barge anchored
at 47
 17
'46
'
' North Latitude and 076
 50
'02
'
' West Longitude. This event will have an unusually large concentration of spectator vessels and falling ash
and debris, which could pose hazards to navigation in the area. This regulation is necessary to ensure the protection
of life, limb, and property on navigable waters during this event. Any vessels desiring to transit the regulated area
may do so only with prior approval of the Patrol Commander (Commanding Officer, U.S. Coast Guard Station Sodus Point,
NY).
This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165.


Federalism Implications


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this regulation and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c
of Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, they are categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.


Economic Assessment and Certification


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of these regulations to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of the DOT is unnecessary.


Collection of Information


This regulation will impose no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; St. Croix River, MN and WI


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final temporary rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a temporary rule to regulate the operation of the S36 Bridge over the St. Croix River
at mile 23.4, at Stillwater. The present opening schedule has contributed to traffic delays and congestion in Stillwater.
The existing regulation is being temporarily amended for the purpose of evaluating the reasonableness of proposed
changes. The Coast Guard is requesting comments from interested parties throughout the evaluation period.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments


The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD02-93-002),
identify the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment.
Each person who wants an acknowledgment of the receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard
or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. The Coast Guard may change or not implement
a final rule in view of the comments.
The Coast Guard does not plan to hold another public meeting. However, persons may request a public meeting by writing
to the Docket Clerk at the address under ADDRESSES

. If the Coast Guard determines that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aid the rulemaking process, the
Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Wanda G. Renshaw, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Commander
Arn Denny, Project Attorney.


Regulatory History


On Friday, October 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled Drawbridge Operation
Regulations, St. Croix River, Minnesota and Wisconsin in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 52466). The Coast Guard received six comments on the proposal. A public meeting was requested and held on April
7, 1994, in the Stillwater Municipal Building.
For the reasons discussed below, the Coast Guard has decided to issue a temporary regulation which will allow it to
evaluate the proposed changes for the remainder of the summer boating season. The Coast Guard has decided that good
cause exists for making this temporary regulation effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 because, since vessel traffic falls off dramatically in the fall, early implementation will provide for an evaluation
period which will include as much of the summer boating season as is possible.


Background and Purpose


The St. Croix River is heavily used by recreational craft. River excursion boats are the only known commercial navigation
passing the bridge. To meet the navigational needs of these boaters, the S36 Bridge is presently required to open on
signal, from May 15 through October 15, on a set schedule of hourly and half-hourly openings from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. From
October 16 through May 14 the draw will open on signal if at least 24 hours notice is given.

<TEXT>
 

The Mayor of Stillwater requested that the operating schedule be amended as a means of reducing traffic congestion
on the approaches to the bridge. As a result, the Coast Guard proposed a change which would permit hourly openings on
weekdays from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and on Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays from 8 a.m. to midnight. The draw would
continue to be operated with two hours advance notice from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. weekdays, and from midnight to 8 a.m., Saturdays,
Sundays, and federal holidays. 


Discussion of Comments and Changes 


The Coast Guard received six comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Three supported the proposed change citing
increased bank erosion from heavy recreational traffic, air pollution from waiting vehicles, and loss of business
in Stillwater due to traffic congestion and delays caused by frequent bridge openings. One, from the Minnesota Historical
Society, stated that the proposed action would have no effect on the historic characteristics of the bridge, which
is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two, a local recreational boater and the owner of a local marina,
objected to the proposed change. The boater commented that traffic congestion existed in downtown Stillwater during
the winter months when the bridge was not opened for river traffic. He noted that excessively long bridge openings,
resulting in increased delay times to highway traffic, during the preceding boating season were caused by unusual
and persistent high river levels, requiring longer span openings to accommodate vessels that could have passed under
the closed span during normal water conditions. He also noted that traffic delays were exacerbated by vehicles parking
on streets approaching the bridge, and that the increased use of the bridge by tractor-trailers often precluded two-way
traffic on the narrow bridge. The marina owner objected to the proposal because he would lose the business of larger
vessels presently moored at his facility which required bridge openings to travel downriver. He commented that the
City of Stillwater had received proposals over the past several years to resolve the traffic congestion, but had not
implemented any of the recommendations. He also noted that street parking in downtown Stillwater restricted traffic
flow. He questioned the perceived increase in boating traffic versus highway traffic, and requested that a public
meeting be held to present the facts and discuss possible solutions. That meeting was convened in Stillwater on April
7, 1994. 
As a result of the public meeting and of the objections to the proposed revision, the Coast Guard requested that Minnesota
Department of Transportation (MNDOT) conduct traffic studies, evaluate the results, and recommend an opening schedule
that would retain an acceptable number of bridge openings and provide for peak highway traffic. Based on its evaluation
of traffic counts and studies, MNDOT advised that no change was warranted by traffic conditions during weekday morning
hours. Because heavy vehicular traffic arrived between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays, MNDOT recommended that the existing
schedule be observed up to and including the 2:30 p.m. opening and that openings after 2:30 p.m. should occur at 4 p.m.,
5:30 p.m., 6:30 p.m., and 7 p.m. with an opening every half hour thereafter until 10 p.m. Because heavy vehicular traffic
arrived between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. on weekends and holidays, MNDOT recommended that the existing schedule be retained,
up to and including the 9 a.m. opening, and that the opening schedule be revised for one opening per hour from 9 a.m. until
8 p.m. with half-hourly openings from 8 p.m. until midnight. 
The Coast Guard has decided to amend the existing regulation with a temporary rule promulgating the opening schedule
recommended by MNDOT. This temporary rule will be evaluated throughout the 1994 St. Croix River boating season and
comments on the revision will continue to be received through November 15, 1994. The Coast Guard decided to make the
amendment under temporary rulemaking rather than under a deviation which is valid only for up to 90 days because extending
the evaluation period through the remainder of the St. Croix boating season provided for a better opportunity to consider
the needs of the public. 


Regulatory Evaluation 


This regulation is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary because operators of commercial vessels have indicated that they can adjust
to the changes without impact on their businesses. 


Small Entities 


After considering the submitted comments, the Coast Guard finds that any impact on small entities, if any, is not substantial.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this temporary rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Collection of Information 


This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et
seq.). 


Federalism Assessment 


The Coast Guard has analyzed this temporary rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that it does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.


Environmental Assessment 


The Coast Guard has reviewed the environmental impact of this temporary rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2
of the NEPA Implementing Procedures, COMDTINST M16475.1B, this temporary rule is categorically excluded from further
environmental documentation because promulgation of changes to drawbridge regulations have been found to not have
a significant effect on the human environment. A categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Core Creek, NC



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This amendment removes the regulations for the S.R. 101 bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 195.8,
Core Creek, North Carolina, because the swing bridge has been removed. A notice of proposed rulemaking has not been
issued for this regulation because removal of the bridge eliminates the need for regulation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Linda L. Gilliam, Project Officer, and LT Monica L. Lombardi,
Project Attorney.



Background and Purpose



The swing bridge across the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, mile 195.8, at Core Creek, North Carolina, was replaced
by a high level fixed bridge along the same alignment. The existing bridge has been removed, thereby eliminating the
need for 33 CFR 117.821(b)(3). This action has no economic consequences. It merely removes regulations for a swing
bridge that no longer exists.

This action necessitates redesignating the regulations listed in 33 CFR 117.821(b) (4), (5) and (6) for the drawbridges
at Surf City, Wrightsville Beach, and Sunset Beach along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway within North Carolina.



Regulatory History



This action is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this ruling to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and
procedures of DOT is unnecessary because the Coast Guard is removing regulations that are no longer necessary.



Collection of Information



This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.).



Federalism



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a federalism assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this final rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

Safety Zone Regulation; Hammerman Area of Gunpowder Falls State Park, Baltimore County, MD



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone for the purpose of the third annual Maryland
``Swim For Life'', at the request of the Maryland ``Swim for Life'' Committee of Baltimore, Maryland. The ``Swim for
Life'' event will consist of a two and a one half mile swim to be held at the Hammerman area of Gunpowder Falls State Park,
Gunpowder River, Maryland. The swim will start at Hammerman area beach number five, to the Maxwell Point buoy, thence
to Oliver Point buoy and thence to Hammerman area beach numbers one and two. This safety zone is necessary to control
small craft and recreational vessel traffic, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters
from the hazards associated with this swimming event. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized by the
Captain of the Port.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On April 13, 1994 a notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 17507) requesting comments on this event. As of May 13, 1994, which was the closure of the comment period, no comments
were received. Since the Coast Guard wanted to provide the public the opportunity to make comments, insufficient
time was left to provide for an effective date 30 days after publication, therefore this regulation will become effective
in less than 30 days from the date of publication.



Background and Purpose




In November, 1993, an application was received by U.S. Coast Guard Group Baltimore from the Maryland Swim For Life
Committee, requesting a safety zone for the ``Swim For Life'' event. This event is to be held in the Hammerman area of
Gunpowder Falls State Park, Gunpowder River, Maryland, on June 18, 1994. As part of their application, the ``Swim
For Life'' Committee requested the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial traffic during the swimming
portion of the event.



Discussion of Regulations



This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of spectator craft, recreational vessels as well as the swimmers
participating in the event, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during the event.
Since the Gunpowder River will not be closed for an extended period, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted.

This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Chief Warrant Officer Timothy P. Ryan, project officer for the Captain of the Port,
Baltimore, Maryland and Lieutenant Monica Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.



Regulatory Evaluation



This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does
not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted
from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the 



Small Entities 



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.

Safety Zone; Town of Old Lyme, CT Fireworks Display



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone in Long Island Sound, around the fireworks barge Walrus located approximately
1500 feet south of Sound View Beach, Old Lyme, CT on July 2, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the maritime community
from possible navigation hazards associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless
authorized by the Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Drafting Information



The drafters of this notice are LCDR T.V. Skuby, project officer for Captain of the Port, Long Island Sound, and LCDR
J. Stieb, project attorney, First Coast Guard District Legal Office.



Regulatory History



As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation. The Coast Guard
did not receive from the sponsor the final details concerning the event's times, which is essential information for
the purposes of establishing a safety zone in sufficient time to publish a NPRM. If the event, which is centered around
a national holiday, were required to be postponed by publishing a NPRM, the event would be cancelled. Publishing a
NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display is for the benefit
of the public.



Background and Purpose



The sponsor, the Town of Old Lyme, CT has requested that a 45 minute fireworks display, launched from a floating platform,
be permitted in the port of Old Lyme in the vicinity of Sound View Beach, Old Lyme, CT. This zone is required to protect
the maritime community from the dangers associated with this fireworks display which is occurring over Long Island
Sound. The safety zone covers all waters of Long Island Sound within a 800 foot radius of the fireworks barge Walrus.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

The event will last approximately 45 minutes. The area affected by this event receives infrequent commercial traffic.
Because of the short duration of the event and the extensive advisories which will be made, commercial entities will
be able to adjust to any disruptions.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

For the reasons addressed under the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation
to be minimal and certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information




This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).



Federalism




The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and has determined that these regulations do not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment




The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of these regulations and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

Agency Program Evaluations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule more fully describes agency and NARA responsibilities as part of the records management evaluations of
Federal agencies that NARA conducts on a regular basis. It discusses the authority, purpose, and scope of these evaluations
and describes specific agency requirements related to the evaluation notification, the evaluation process, transmittal
of the report, and preparation of action plans and regular progress reports. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 NARA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on December 10, 1993 (58 FR 64915) for a 30-day comment period. Subsequently,
in a notice published on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 8150), NARA reopened the comment period for an additional 30-day period
and announced a public meeting for agency records officers on February 28, 1994. Twenty-three written comments were
received. Approximately 50 records officers attended the meeting held at the National Archives at College Park to
discuss the proposed regulations. All comments received careful consideration in the development of the final rule.
Following is a section-by-section discussion of the major issues raised in the public meeting and written comments.



Section by Section Analysis 



Section 1220.14 General Definitions 



One agency proposed changing the definition of evaluation to that included in NARA's 

A Records Management Glossary.

 NARA agrees and has changed the definition. In addition, language reflecting the followup aspect of an evaluation
has been added. 

One agency suggested that the use of ``adequate and proper documentation'' for consistency with current NARA regulations
and published guides. This change has been made. 



Section 1220.42 Agency Internal Evaluations 



This requirement generated numerous comments and discussion. All comments noted that the proposed biennial evaluation
of an agency's records management program would place an unnecessary burden on agencies that already have limited
resources for records management. One agency pointed out that the Paperwork Reduction Act requires triennial reviews
of information management programs. Other agencies commented that this proposed rule seems inconsistent with the
intent of the current mandates to reinvent government and streamline government operations. 

Because of the burden a biennial reporting requirement would impose on agencies this proposed requirement has been
dropped. The requirement that an agency ``should periodically evaluate its records management programs * * *''
that was contained in the superseded regulation at  1220.54 is retained in this regulation. NARA is developing
additional guidance to aid agencies in performing self-evaluations of their records management programs. 



Section 1220.50 Authority 



One agency suggested that NARA should be required to estimate costs incurred by implementation of NARA evaluation
report recommendations which an agency agrees to implement and that reports to Congress, OMB, or other oversight
agency, should include an agency's success stories. 

To the extent that NARA can identify and obtain cost information, it will be included in any reports to Congress. NARA's
policy is to always include agency success stories in final evaluation reports, whether or not the reports are to be
submitted to Congress. 



Section 1220.52 Purpose and Scope 



Three agencies suggested clarifications. Two agencies commented that NARA does not quantify the efficacy of Federal
agencies efforts to make and preserve complete and accurate records but rather that NARA reviews records management
programs. NARA has modified this section to indicate that evaluations assess records management programs. This
more accurately describes the evaluation process as a cooperative effort. 

One agency noted the misuse of ``inter-agency'' in describing a single agency evaluation focusing on all aspects
of records management at all administrative levels. The phrase ``inter-agency'' has been changed to ``one agency.''

Section 1220.54 NARA Evaluation Process


Selection Process


Several agencies suggested changes in the selection criteria used by NARA. Suggested alternatives included conducting
an evaluation only upon request; setting an evaluation cycle; and identifying agencies that have significantly
changed patterns of use of Federal records centers. Attendees at the records officer meeting and the majority of written
comments agreed with the criteria proposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking. This section has not been changed
in the final rule.
Two agencies questioned the meaning of ``perceived need'' and ``compliance monitoring cycle.'' Perceived need
means NARA's knowledge of agency operations as they apply to the records management program. This includes retirement
patterns of records to FRCs, the transfer of permanent records to NARA, and scheduling activities by the agency. The
compliance monitoring cycle, to be developed by NARA, is a method of tracking the cyclical review of agencies.


Method of Notification


Two agencies suggested that the NARA letter of notification should specify the scope of the evaluation to enable agencies
to make adequate preparations. Another agency stated that the agency head or his/her designee will determine who
will carry out responsibilities stipulated in the regulations. Another agency suggested that the regulations regarding
agency response exceeds NARA's authority to direct the internal operation of the agency concerning the individuals
to be notified of the evaluation.
NARA agrees and made appropriate changes.


Provision of Information Prior to an Evaluation


Two agencies noted that NARA has all approved agency schedules; two agencies found the requirement to provide all
issuances relating to records management to be onerous; one agency objected to providing a list of agency information
systems not currently covered by schedules; one agency noted that contractors will have serious reservations about
making records with proprietary and trade information available to NARA; and one agency objected to the tone of this
section.
Becoming familiar with an agency's records management program, including the program's internal requirements,
is an important preliminary step for NARA prior to beginning an evaluation. However, NARA agrees that most relevant
information is available in a limited number of agency issuances and NARA does have copies of all approved agency schedules.
Section 1220.54(b)(4) has been changed to reflect this.
The maintenance of a list of agency information systems is required by OMB Circular A-130, section 9a(5), so
providing this information to NARA should not impose an additional burden. NARA will use this list to determine which
systems have not been scheduled.
36 CFR 1222.48(e) states that ``All data created for Government use and delivered to, or falling under, the legal control
of, the Government are Federal records and shall be managed in accordance with records management legislation * * *''
Records created by contractors for the agency are Federal records and as such are included in NARA's evaluation authority.
NARA staff are trained to handle agency records containing sensitive information appropriately.


Section 1220.56 Evaluation Report


Report Distribution


The distribution requirements of the final report generated comments and discussion. Some agency representatives
think that distribution should be limited to individuals and offices affected by findings and recommendations,
while others thought the reports should be widely distributed. One agency suggested that the final report should
be sent to the Agency Records Officer with a copy to the agency head.
While NARA thinks that a wide distribution of the report within an agency will help to highlight the importance of proper
records management, it is appropriate that the agency determine the internal distribution of a report. The final
report is issued under the signature of the Archivist of the United States and should be transmitted to his or her equivalent
at the agency. Additionally, sending the report to the agency head will ensure that he or she is aware of the evaluation
and this action may heighten awareness of the agency records management program at the highest level of agency management.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NARA agrees that the agency should determine the distribution of the final report within the agency. The language
of the regulation has been changed to read ``Distribute the final report to all concerned and appropriate persons
and offices.''


Reporting Deadlines and Draft Report


Agencies commented that, while the regulations specify reporting deadlines for agencies to respond to an evaluation,
there is no time limit for NARA to finalize the report. One agency suggested that this section indicate that the 120-day
period NARA has to provide a draft report to the agency begins following the last site visit or final exit briefing.
NARA agrees and changed the regulation to add that NARA will produce the draft report within 120 days following the
last site visit or final exit briefing and that the final report will be sent to the head of the agency within 30 days after
receiving agency comments on the draft report.
One agency suggested that agencies should be allowed to comment on the recommendations when commenting on the factual
contents of the report. This is standard practice when reviewing an audit or evaluation report. If an agency chooses
to comment on the recommendations at this stage, the comments will allow NARA to identify potential problems that
may develop during the followup actions. Furthermore, such comments may clarify an agency's internal operations
for NARA and allow the development of a more appropriate recommendation. The regulation has been changed accordingly.
Two agencies suggested that the provision in the current  1220.52(b)(1) giving agencies the right to provide
rationale in the action plan for not implementing a recommendation be included in the revised regulations. NARA agrees
that an agency should have the right to provide rationale for not implementing a recommendation if it is unable to do
so. Section 1220.58(a)(1)(ii) has been amended accordingly.


Section 1220.58 Agency Action Plans and Progress Reports


One agency requested a 120 day period after receiving the final report submitting an action plan to NARA, stating that
this extension is important for agencies that are deficient in many areas. NARA thinks that 90 days is an adequate period
for most agency to prepare an action plan. However, the regulation has been changed to allow for agencies to request
an extension.
One agency commented extensively on NARA's proposed requirement that agencies provide individual action plans
for evaluated field sites. They noted that such reports are an unauthorized interagency reporting requirement;
there is no indication that NARA would analyze field action plans and provide feedback to the agency about them; and
without periodic status reports, there is no value to the action plans.
The value of including individual site summaries in the final report has been proven in previous evaluations. NARA
intends to continue this practice. In order to track followup actions at these individual sites, it may be necessary
to request individual action plans. If this is the case, NARA will analyze them and provide feedback. The language
of the regulation has been changed to reflect this intention.
One agency suggested that estimating the month and year for starting and completing each action is unrealistic: proposed
quarters and years would be better. NARA agrees and has changed the regulation accordingly.
In response to a suggestion from one agency, NARA added criteria for closing recommendations to this section of the
regulation.
One agency suggested that the action plan be submitted by the agency head or Designated Senior Official for Information
Resources Management rather than ``senior management official responsible for records and information management.''
We have made this change.
One agency noted that the requirement to provide the name of officials or offices specifically responsible for initiating
and completing each proposed action is extensive. NARA agrees that it is appropriate for the agency to determine who
will track individual recommendations. The regulation has been changed to require the agency head to designate an
individual who will serve as NARA's contact for evaluation followup.


Section 1220.60 Followup Notification and Reviews


One agency suggested that reporting to Congress and/or appropriate Federal oversight agencies of evaluation findings
and agency response be mandatory. Other agencies commented that reporting to Congress would be a valuable tool to
use to highlight the importance of records management in agencies. The majority opinion is that NARA should send every
evaluation report to Congress or the appropriate Federal oversight agency.
One agency said that NARA should be required to provide agencies with the factors by which NARA determines that an agency
is not progressing in a satisfactory manner and that the agency head should be notified before NARA reports to Congress.
If NARA determines that there has been insufficient progress in fully implementing recommendations or that the agency
has not corrected problems identified by NARA, then NARA will notify the head of the agency. After the head of the agency
has been notified, NARA may also notify the appropriate oversight agencies or appropriate Congressional committees.
Section 1220.60 has been changed accordingly.

Other Comments 


In the preamble to the proposed rule, NARA asked for specific comments on NARA's selection criteria and criteria for
performance measurement. Comments received on selection criteria are discussed under the heading ``SELECTION
PROCESS'' above. Several agencies * * * commented on criteria for performance measurement. One agency
suggested that ``one approach would be to establish a baseline for specific functions/responsibilities via a status
survey and to monitor improvement progress for those functions.'' Another agency suggested that a performance measurement
could be ``how well agencies * * * carry out recommendations without follow-up notification and reviews.''
Another idea is ``whether violations of applicable laws or regulation * * * has been corrected timely.''
Other commentators suggested that NARA conduct a government-wide survey of all Federal agencies' records management
programs. Such a survey would provide an initial starting point for identifying problems or regulations that are
difficult to implement and enforce. 
NARA plans to develop performance measurements that will help determine how effectively agencies are implementing
evaluation recommendations. NARA also plans to develop measures to assess the success of its evaluation program
in terms of programmatic improvements or improved work products. 
Three agencies offered general comments on the evaluation process. One agency would like to see NARA conduct studies
of more agencies in shorter time frames and then share the findings government-wide. This would be ``more beneficial
to the government and an improved use of limited NARA resources.'' One agency thinks the time frame (13 months) to conduct
an evaluation is too excessive. 
NARA will continue to conduct full evaluations of agency records management programs. Additionally, in FY95 NARA
will begin conducting additional shorter and more focused evaluations. 
Another agency suggested that, while NARA evaluations are similar to GSA IRM reviews, they are conducted very differently.
GSA, for example, takes steps to prepare agencies for reviews by using standard scoping questionnaires and with self
assessment tools that are linked to their evaluation process. GSA issues its cyclical review schedule each year so
agencies know well in advance when they can expect to be reviewed and can prepare for it. Since NARA only notifies an
agency 60 days before an evaluation, this can result in agencies being more surprised than prepared and the evaluation
can become a negative rather than a positive experience. 
We agree that earlier notification would assist agencies being evaluated, and have modified  1220.54 (a) to
provide the notice of a planned evaluation at least 180 days in advance. NARA also intends to work with the appropriate
office in GSA to determine how best to coordinate the evaluation processes of both agencies. 
This rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and has not been reviewed
by OMB. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have
a significant impact on small business entities.

Subpart C_NARA Evaluation Program 



 1220.50 


Authority. 


44 U.S.C. chapter 29 vests in the Archivist of the United States the responsibility for providing guidance and assistance
to Federal agencies with respect to ensuring adequate and proper documentation and proper records disposition.
Sections 2904 and 2906 specifically authorize the Archivist to conduct inspections or surveys of records and records
management programs and practices within and between Federal agencies and require officers and employees of agencies
to cooperate fully in such inspections. Section 2904 also authorizes the Archivist to report to the appropriate oversight
and appropriations committees of the Congress and the Director of OMB on the results of inspections, the responses
by agencies to NARA evaluation recommendations, and estimates of the costs to the Federal government resulting from
the failure to implement such recommendations. 


 1220.52 


Purpose and scope. 


(a) NARA evaluations assess how effectively Federal agencies make and preserve complete and accurate records of
their organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, and essential transactions; and maintain an
active, continuing records management program including proper records disposition. Agencies shall be evaluated
for compliance with requirements in 44 U.S.C. chapters 31 and 33 and all the regulations issued thereunder in 36 CFR
subchapter B. 
(b) NARA evaluations may include comprehensive reviews of agency records management programs, or selective reviews
focused on adequate and proper documentation, on records disposition, on the management of specific types of record
media or on the management of records in particular program areas. NARA evaluations may be of one agency or may be multi-agency.
These evaluations may be conducted solely within headquarters offices, only at field locations, or at a combination
of field sites and headquarters. 
(c) Evaluations will involve site visits by NARA; submission by NARA to the agency of a written report containing findings,
analyses, and recommendations; and submission to NARA by the agency of an action plan for implementing the recommendations
followed by regular progress reports. Interagency report control number 0153-NARA-AR has been assigned
to the action plan and progress reports in accordance with 41 CFR subpart 201-45.6.

Evaluation process.




(a) NARA shall select Federal agencies to be evaluated on the basis of perceived need by NARA or specific request by
the agency, or on the basis of a compliance monitoring cycle developed by NARA. NARA will determine the scope of the
evaluation. An agency may request an evaluation of its records management program by contacting the Assistant Archivist
for Records Administration; however, the final determination of agencies to be evaluated will be made by NARA. The
heads of agencies will be notified in writing by the Archivist of the United States of the intent to conduct an evaluation
and the scope of the evaluation at least 180 calendar days prior to initiating the evaluation.

(b) Once NARA has notified the agency, the agency head will, by the date specified in the Archivist's letter:

(1) Acknowledge in writing NARA's intention to evaluate, and provide the Archivist with the name and telephone number
of the senior official with overall responsibility for records management and of a headquarters official who will
work with NARA to facilitate the evaluation process;

(2) Provide written notification of the evaluation to all appropriate offices and employees and contractors potentially
involved; this notification will include instructions to cooperate with NARA by setting up interviews, providing
requested information, and making records available for inspection;

(3) Provide NARA with a copy of the written notification in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and with a list of names
and telephone numbers of officials responsible for records management in field sites, if applicable, who will work
with NARA during the evaluation;

(4) For comprehensive evaluations, provide NARA with a set of internal records management directives, orders, bulletins,
or similar authoritative issuances; copies of the two most recent internal records management evaluations; and
any special records-related reports. Included may be: issuances relating to adequate and proper documentation
and recordkeeping requirements; personal papers; management and disposition of textual, electronic, audiovisual,
cartographic and architectural, micrographic, and vital records; disaster mitigation and recovery; and any other
records-related documentation requested by NARA. A subset of this documentation will be requested for more limited
evaluations;

(5) Provide NARA with a current version of the agency manual(s) covering records creation, maintenance, storage,
and disposition, and a list of information systems maintained as required by OMB Circular A-130, section 9a(5),
and a list of offices and/or functions and activities not currently covered by schedules;

(6) Arrange for appropriate management and program officials in headquarters and, if applicable, at field sites
to be briefed by NARA at the beginning and at the end of the evaluation process; and

(7) Take immediate corrective action regarding any serious problems that NARA may bring to the agency's attention
during the course of the evaluation process such as the unauthorized destruction of records or the unauthorized donation
or other transfer of records to non-NARA facilities.



 1220.56


Evaluation report.



(a) NARA will submit a draft evaluation report for factual review and comment to the agency within 120 calendar days
of the last evaluation site visit or exit briefing. After receipt of agency comments, NARA will finalize the report,
incorporating any changes resulting from factual errors identified by the agency. The final report will be transmitted
by the Archivist to the head of the agency within 30 calendar days of receiving comments from the agency.

(b) The head of the agency will:

(1) Comment within 60 calendar days, in writing, on the contents of the draft report. If necessary, agencies can request
extensions. No response from the agency within the allotted time will indicate that the agency concurs in the factual
accuracy of the draft report.

(2) Review the final report and assign implementation responsibility; and

(3) Distribute the final report to all concerned and appropriate persons and offices.



 1220.58

(2) NARA will analyze the action plan(s) submitted by the agency for adequacy and effectiveness in implementing the
recommendations contained in the evaluation report. NARA will provide comments to the agency on the plan(s) within
60 calendar days.

(3) The agency will revise the action plan until it is approved by NARA.

(b) 

Progress reports.

 (1) Once the action plan(s) has been approved by NARA, the head of the agency will submit progress reports to NARA every
6 months. The reports will include:

(i) A description of what has been accomplished on each action since the last report;

(ii) The current status of the action;

(iii) Any changes in the offices or programs responsible for over-all or specific action implementation; and,

(iv) If appropriate, explanation of any delays in implementation and revised target dates and milestones for completion
of the action.

(2) The agency will continue to submit these progress reports until NARA and the agency agree all actions have been
completed, NARA and the agency agree that the agency has implemented the recommendation(s) to the fullest extent
possible, or NARA indicates in writing that regular progress reports are no longer required.

(3) NARA will review and comment on agency progress reports, and work closely with the agency to provide assistance
in evaluation implementation.



 1220.60


Follow-up notification and reviews.



(a) If NARA determines that there is not substantial progress in the full implementation of evaluation recommendations
or that the agency has not corrected serious problems identified in the report, the Archivist, after notifying the
head of the agency, may notify Congress and appropriate Federal oversight agencies of the evaluation findings and
the agency response.

(b) NARA may initiate follow-up reviews at specific offices or field sites. Results of these follow-up reviews shall
be communicated to the head of the agency and, if NARA determines it to be appropriate, to Congress and Federal oversight
agencies.

Approval and Promulgation of a Small Business Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program; Michigan




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA approves the Michigan State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Michigan for the
purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program (PROGRAM). The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate of the Clean
Air Act (Act), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory information
necessary to comply with the Act. The rationale for the approval is set forth in this notice; additional information
is available at the addresses indicated below. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Implementation of the provisions of the Act, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of
air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the Federally
approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the EPA to oversee these small business assistance programs and report
to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of title
V of the Act. In February 1992, the EPA issued ``Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air
Act Amendments'' to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
In order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The
establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small
businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses
in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the
overall effectiveness of the PROGRAM. 
In order to satisfy the requirements of section 507, on November 11, 1992, January 8, 1993, and November 12, 1993, the
State of Michigan submitted a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program as a revision to its SIP. The November 12, 1993 submittal included the Michigan Small Business Clean Air Assistance
Act of 1993. 


II. Analysis 


1. Small Business Assistance Program 


Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements
 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting, and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. 




The State has met this requirement by establishing the Air Quality Small Business Assistance Program (AQSBAP) and
requiring it to develop this aspect of the SBAP. The AQSBAP outreach program will coordinate activities with existing
groups that represent small businesses' interests and/or come in contact with large numbers of small businesses.
As new standards and requirements are promulgated, the AQSBAP will translate the requirements into understandable
terms and disseminate the information through these organizations, which include the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources Air Quality Division (MDNR AQD), the Small Business Clean Air Ombudsman (SBCAO), the Michigan Department
of Public Health, local emergency planning committees, trade associations, chambers of commerce, newspapers,
business and trade journals, economic development groups, universities, and electronic databases. The AQSBAP
will also seek participation in these organizations' conferences and meetings. In addition, the AQSBAP will develop
a client tracking system to help assess program needs, and to develop small business mailing lists. To address reactive
information needs, the AQSBAP will assist in operating an ``800'' telephone clearinghouse service which will be
able to provide technical assistance. To address the program's technical resource needs, the AQSBAP will provide
its own technical specialists, as well as develop mechanisms for obtaining additional technical support from appropriate
Federal, State, and other organizations. The AQSBAP will also develop an air quality resource center, which will
be available to the AQSBAP technical specialists.

<TEXT>
 

The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products, and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution.

The State has met this requirement by promoting pollution prevention and offering technical assistance through
the AQSBAP and several existing programs also within the Environmental Sciences Division (ESD). The AQSBAP and the
Office of Waste Reduction Services will help businesses locate and take advantage of pollution prevention opportunities.
The AQSBAP and the Education/Outreach program will work together in the development of fact sheets and case studies
which highlight pollution prevention technologies. In addition, these programs will jointly participate in seminars
and workshops. The AQSBAP will address accidental release detection and prevention by training technical specialists
in these practices and technologies. General questions will be addressed by these specialists, and complex questions
will be referred to the EPA's Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, or the Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know Hotline. State organizations, including the State Emergency Response Commission, the
Michigan Chemical Council, the Emergency Management Division of the Michigan Department of State Police, and the
Michigan Department of Public Health will also be used as resources. The outreach program described in the first requirement
above will be used to distribute publications and information about upcoming workshops on accidental release prevention.

The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. 
The State has met this requirement by providing an ``800'' number and by offering individual meetings to provide one
on one compliance assistance. The AQSBAP technical specialists will be able to identify applicable air quality regulations,
determine whether or not a permit is needed, identify methods for achieving compliance, and explain the permitting
procedures. The AQSBAP will use the outreach methods described in the first requirement above to disseminate information
regarding new standards and requirements. 
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that
small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the Act. The AQSBAP and the MDNR AQD will develop
a fact sheet that notifies small businesses of their rights under the Act and Michigan's Air Pollution Act, and explains
the legal recourse should they be notified of a violation. This information will be provided during site visits and
presentations at trade association meetings, and will be uploaded on the NEWBIZ computer database. The AQSBAP will
also develop and disseminate through the outreach program timely fact sheets notifying small businesses of proposed
and final regulations issued under the Act that affect their businesses. 
The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. 
The State has met this requirement by establishing information dissemination mechanisms to ensure that small business
stationary sources receive notice of their obligations under new regulations. These mechanisms are the same as those
listed above for notifying sources of their rights. In addition, the AQSBAP will develop and distribute a list of consultants
that can provide air quality audits of small businesses. The AQSBAP will also develop a fact sheet that helps small
businesses select a reputable auditor. In addition, the AQSBAP will investigate the feasibility of implementing
its own voluntary audit program. 
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of (A) any work practice or technological method of compliance, or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. 
The State has met this requirement by addressing such requests under Modification to Act 348, Part 6 Rules, which contains
the procedures that businesses must follow in obtaining approval for such a request. Responses to requests relating
to Federal standards will be coordinated with the EPA. The AQSBAP will assist small businesses in identifying these
procedures. 


2. Ombudsman 


Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by establishing the Small Business Clean Air Ombudsman (SBCAO) and the
Office of the SBCAO within the Michigan Department of Commerce. The SBCAO is required to represent the interests of
small businesses, and to assure that the goals of the AQSBAP are met. The SBCAO is required to perform many duties, including:
Conducting evaluations of all aspects of the program; reviewing and commenting on requirements that impact small
businesses; facilitating and promoting small business participation in rule development; disseminating information;
participating and sponsoring meetings with regulatory officials, industry groups, and small business representatives;
investigating and resolving complaints and disputes from small businesses against State or local air pollution
control agencies; referring small businesses to the appropriate technical specialists; assisting in the preparation
of small business guidance documents; assisting small businesses in locating financial assistance for compliance
requirements; and studying the financial impacts of requirements on small businesses. It is expected that the Governor
will be making the Ombudsman appointment by June 1994, but no later than November 1, 1994.

3. Compliance Advisory Panel 


Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. 
The State has met this requirement by establishing a CAP which includes these appointments. The enabling legislation
also outlines general policies and procedures for administering the CAP. As of April 1, 1994, five of the seven CAP
appointments had been made. All CAP appointments will be completed by June 1994, but no later than November 1, 1994.

In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP, the Act delineates four responsibilities of the Panel:
(1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP, difficulties encountered and the degree
and severity of enforcement actions; (2) to periodically report to the EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the
principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act;
 (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable; and (4)
to develop and disseminate the reports and advisory opinions made through the SBAP. The State has met these requirements
by requiring the CAP to meet these responsibilities. In addition, the AQSBAP and the SBCAO staff will provide support
to the CAP in its efforts to carry out these responsibilities. 




4. Eligibility 


Section 507(c)(1) of the Act defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that: 
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
Michigan's Small Business Clean Air Assistance Act similarly defines the term ``small business,'' and expands criterion
(C) to include major stationary sources which are major because of their location in a nonattainment area. To avoid
discouraging businesses from seeking assistance, Michigan intends to use a flexible definition of small business
when implementing the program. The type of service and the amount of resources necessary to carry out the service will
dictate whether a broad or narrow eligibility definition is used. This is consistent with section 507(c)(2) of the
Act. 
The State of Michigan has provided for public notice and comment on grants of eligibility to sources that both do not
emit more than 100 tpy of all regulated pollutants and do not meet the eligibility provisions of sections 507(c)(1)
(C), (D), and (E) of the Act. In response to such a petition by a stationary source, the Director of the MDNR may define
a source as a ``small business.'' This is consistent with section 507(c)(2) of the Act. 
The State of Michigan has provided for exclusion from the ``small business'' definition for any category or subcategory
of sources that the State determines to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to meet the requirements
of the Act. The Director of the MDNR may exclude such sources after consultation with the EPA and the Small Business
Administration and after providing notice and opportunity for public hearing. This provision is consistent with
section 507(c)(3). 


III. Final Rulemaking 


Michigan has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507
of the Act. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994. 
Because the EPA considers this final rule noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal.
This rule will become effective on August 2, 1994. However, if we receive notice by July 5, 1994 that someone wishes
to submit adverse comments, then the EPA will publish: (1) A notice that withdraws the action, and (2) a notice that
begins a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a comment period. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables this action
remains classified as a Table 2. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP
revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has
submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continued in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities;

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 



OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
By today's action, the EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved today does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

Proof of Commitment To Employ Aboard U.S. Merchant Vessels



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard amends its regulations covering applicants for merchant mariner's documents to eliminate the requirement
that the applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel.
Because of new requirements pertaining to applicants of merchant mariner's documents, the requirement for proof
of a commitment of employment is no longer necessary. This action will relieve applicants and employers of an unnecessary
regulatory burden.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mrs. Justine Bunnell, Project Manager, Office of Marine
Safety, Security and Environment Protection, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.


Regulatory History



On December 6, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``Proof of Commitment
to Employ Aboard U.S. Merchant Vessels'' in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 64278). The Coast Guard received four letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested
and one was not held.



Background and Purpose




Section 12.25-5 of title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires an applicant for an original merchant
mariner's document (MMD) endorsed for service in ratings for which no professional examination is required to produce
satisfactory proof of a commitment of employment (letter of commitment) as a member of the crew of a United States merchant
vessel. This requirement was established in 1937 as a means to ensure that those persons obtaining MMDs were actually
to be employed as merchant mariners. Because no fee or renewal requirements had been associated with application
for an MMD, many applying for an MMD were doing so to obtain a desirable form of identification, and had no intention
of seeking employment as a merchant mariner.


On March 19, 1993, the Coast Guard published a final rule establishing user fees for services relating to marine licensing,
certification of registry, and merchant mariner documentation (58 FR 15228). That rule established an issuance
fee of $35 for an MMD with an additional $17 charge for an FBI criminal record check if the application is for an original
MMD. As noted in the preamble of the user fee final rule, as a result of the user fee and other expenses, individuals with
no intention of returning to sea may choose not to renew a license. Likewise, the user fee will deter individuals with
no intention of obtaining employment as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel from applying for an
MMD. For this reason, the Coast Guard now considers the requirement for a letter of commitment unnecessary, and the
requirement is removed by this rulemaking. This final rule also makes conforming changes to 46 CFR part 16 to remove
references to ``commitment of employment.''



Discussion of Comments and Changes



Four comments were received during the comment period. All of the comments supported the rulemaking as proposed.
Therefore, no changes have been included in this final rule.



Regulatory Assessment



This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and, has not been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget. It is also not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be so minimal
that a full Regulatory Assessment is unnecessary. This final rule will relieve applicants of the burden of obtaining
a letter from a new employer evidencing the employer's commitment to hire the applicant. Employers will be relieved
of the burden of supplying such letters. While the cost of obtaining and supplying such letters is considered minimal,
this action will relieve industry and applicants of an unnecessary regulatory requirement.



Small Entities




This final rule will eliminate the requirement that an applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment as a member
of the crew of a United States merchant vessel. The amendments will have minimal economic impact on the maritime industry.
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

et seq

.), that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This final rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq

.).

Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this final rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
and has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. The authority to establish regulations pertaining to the issuance of merchant mariner's
documents has been committed to the Secretary of Transportation by Federal statute and delegated to the Coast Guard.
Documentation of merchant mariners is a matter national in application for which regulations should be of national
scope to avoid unreasonably burdensome variances. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing
the same matter, although no such action is expected.


Environment


The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this final rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this action is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
The amendment involves only elimination of the requirement that an applicant provide proof of a commitment of employment
as a member of the crew of a United States merchant vessel prior to receiving an MMD and clearly would have no environmental
impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated
under

Designated Critical Habitat; Northern Right Whale 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is designating critical habitat for the northern right whale (

Eubalaena glacialis

). The designated habitat includes portions of Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank, the Great South Channel (each off
the coast of Massachusetts), and waters adjacent to the coasts of Georgia and the east coast of Florida. This designation
provides notice to Federal agencies and the public that a listed species is dependent on these areas and features for
its continued existence and that any Federal action that may affect these areas or features is subject to the consultation
requirements of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Right whales, 

Eubalaena

 spp., are the most endangered of the large whale species, brought to extremely low levels by commercial whaling. Right
whales were the earliest targets of whaling and, although they have been protected world-wide from commercial whaling
by international agreements since 1935, right whale populations still remain extremely depleted. The global population
of right whales is comprised of two separate species, one each in both the northern and southern hemisphere, and several
stocks or populations within each hemisphere. The majority of right whales occur in the southern hemisphere (the
southern right whale, 

E. australis

) and are considered a separate species from the right whale in the northern hemisphere 
(

E. glacialis

). 

At least two populations of northern right whales, an eastern and a western population, occur, or have occurred, in
the North Atlantic. The eastern North Atlantic population may be nearly extinct. Between 1935-1985, there
were only 21 possible sightings in the eastern North Atlantic, totaling 45 individuals (Brown, 1986). Furthermore,
Brown (1986) considered only five of these sightings (seven individual whales) to be confirmed. In the western North
Atlantic, the known distribution and abundance of right whales indicate a ``best available'' population estimate
of 300-350 individuals. Despite the low abundance and known anthropogenic factors affecting total mortality
(Kraus, 1990), the western North Atlantic stock is the largest in the Northern Hemisphere. This population stands
to benefit most from recovery actions (NMFS, 1991; Kenney, Winn and Macaulay, 1994). 

Like other baleen whales, the western North Atlantic population of right whales (hereafter referred to as the northern
right whale) is migratory. The known distribution and migratory pattern has been previously summarized by Kraus
(1985); Winn, Price and Sorensen (1986); Gaskin (1987, 1991); and by Kraus et al. (1986). The five primary habitats
used by northern right whales during their annual migration, as described by Kenney, Winn and Macaulay (1994), include
the following three areas off the eastern coast of the United States: (1) A spring/early summer feeding and nursery
area for a majority of the population in the Great South Channel (GSC), (2) a late winter/spring feeding and nursery
area for a small portion of the population in Cape Cod Bay (CCB), and (3) a winter calving ground and nursery area in the
coastal waters of the southeastern United States (SEUS); and the following two areas located in Canadian waters:
(4) a summer/fall feeding and nursery area for some animals, including nearly all mother/calf pairs, in the lower
Bay of Fundy; and (5) a summer/fall feeding ground, with almost exclusively mature individuals, on the southern Nova
Scotian shelf. 

The northern right whale was listed as endangered on June 2, 1970 (35 FR 8495). Section 9 of the ESA prohibits the taking
of endangered species, and section 7 requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize
either threatened and endangered species. For species listed prior to 1978, when Congress required that critical
habitat be designated, concurrently with the listing, critical habitat may be designated although such designation
is not required. Section 4(f) of the ESA also requires the responsible agency to develop and implement a recovery plan
for listed species, unless such a plan would not promote the conservation and recovery of the species. NMFS determined
that a recovery plan would promote the conservation of the northern right whale. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries (AA) appointed a Recovery Team consisting of experts on right whales from the private sector, academia
and government. A Recovery Plan for the Northern Right Whale was approved by NMFS in December, 1991 (NMFS, 1991). 

NMFS was petitioned by the Right Whale Recovery Team to designate critical habitat for the northern right whale on
May 18, 1990. A 

Federal Register

 notice was published on July 12, 1990 (55 FR 28670), requesting information and comments on the petition. Of those
agencies, organizations, and private groups that commented, most responded favorably to the designation of the
three areas in the U.S. as critical habitat for the northern right whale. The comments received were considered and
incorporated as appropriate by NMFS in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat for northern right whales.
The proposed rule was published on May 19, 1993 (58 FR 29186), and provided for a 60-day comment period. NMFS also completed
an Environmental Assesment (EA) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to evaluate both the environmental
and economic impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation. The EA resulted in a finding of no significant
impact for the proposed action.

During the comment period, NMFS received several requests for public hearings on the proposed designation. Public
hearings were held in Boston, MA, on August 25, 1993; in Port Canaveral, FL, on August 24, 1993; and in Brunswick, GA,
on August 25, 1993 (58 FR 41454, Aug. 4, 1993). The comment period was extended until August 31, 1993, to allow commenters
the opportunity to respond to concerns voiced at the public hearings. After consideration of public comments, and
based on the best available scientific information, NMFS is designating critical habitat for the northern right
whale as described in the proposed rule. 



Definition of Critical Habitat 



``Critical habitat'', as defined in section 3(5)(A) of the ESA, and the term ``conservation'', as defined in section
3(3) of the ESA, were provided in the preamble to the proposed rule 
(58 FR 29186, May 19, 1993). 



Essential Habitat of the Northern Right Whale 



Biological information for the northern right whale can be found in the Recovery Plan (NMFS, 1991), and in recent scientific
literature (Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986; Kenney et al., 1986; Wishner et al., 1988; Mayo and Marx, 1990; Payne et
al., 1990; Kraus and Kenney, 1991; Kraus et al., 1993; Kenney, Winn and Macauley, 1994). The physical and biological
habitat features of the critical habitat are discussed herein. 



Foraging Habitat of the Northern Right Whale 



Right whales have been characterized principally as ``skim'' feeders (Kawamura, 1974; Nemoto and Kawamura, 1977).
They subsist primarily on dense swarms of calanoid copepods, notably 

Calanus finmarchicus

 in the North Atlantic (Mitchell, 1975; Watkins and Schevill, 1979; Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986; Wishner et al.,
1988; Mayo and Marx, 1990; Kraus and Kenney, 1991). Northern right whales are also known to prey on other similar sized
zooplankton. Two other zooplankton species preyed upon by northern right whales in CCB include 

Pseudocalanus minutis

 and 

Centropages

 spp. (Mayo and Marx, 1990). A strong positive correlation between the abundance of right whales in the southern Gulf
of Maine and densities of 

C. finmarchicus

 has been described by Kenney et al. (1986), Wishner et al. (1988), Payne et al. (1990), and Kenney, Winn and Macauley
(1994). The two recorded time intervals when right whales were most abundant in the CCB/Stellwagen Bank area (April
1970, reported by Watkins and Schevill, 1982; and during 1986, reported by Payne et al., 1990) were during periods
of observed peak densities of copepods. 

While the size and density of copepod patches are important to the feeding energetics of right whales, so are the relative
proportions of adult copepods within each patch (Kenney et al., 1986; Wishner et al., 1988). Although the feeding
ecology of right whales is likely more complex than previously thought (Mayo and Marx, 1990), dense aggregations
of older, caloric-rich copepods seem to be the required characteristics for energetically successful foraging
by right whales. If copepods in these caloric-rich, adult developmental stages are not available to northern right
whales in sufficient densities, there may be insufficient prey available in the remaining developmental stages
(independent of abundance) to provide right whales with the required energy densities (as described by Kenney et
al., 1986) to meet the metabolic and reproductive demands of the right whale population in the western North Atlantic
(Kenney et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1990). 



Foraging Habitat: 

The overall spatial requirements for right whales are not well defined; however, the distribution pattern observed
for northern right whales indicates that four of the five principal habitats occupied by right whales in the western
North Atlantic are used for foraging, and possibly reproductive activities: The GSC, CCB, the Bay of Fundy, and the
Scotian Shelf. Neither feeding nor courtship behavior has been observed along the SEUS. Scientists believe that
subadult and adult baleen whales fast, or feed rarely, during the winter calving period. 

Based on observed distribution patterns compared to oceanographic conditions, scientists speculate that the topographic
and seasonal oceanographic characteristics of foraging areas are conducive to the dense growth of zooplankton.
These high-use areas may comprise the minimal space required for normal foraging behavior that will support the northern
right whale population. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada) has already designated two foraging areas
as right whale sanctuaries_one in the Bay of Fundy and another on the Scotian Shelf. The remaining two foraging habitats,
the GSC and CCB, are found in the United States and are included as critical habitat for the northern right whale. 



Great South Channel: 

The GSC is a large funnel-shaped bathymetric feature at the southern extreme of the Gulf of Maine between Georges Bank
and Cape Cod, MA. The GSC is one of the most used cetacean habitats off the northeastern United States (Kenney and Winn,
1986). The channel is bordered on the west by Cape Cod and Nantucket Shoals, and on the east by Georges Bank. The channel
is generally deeper to the north and shallower to the south, where it narrows and rises to the continental shelf edge.
To the north, the channel opens into several deepwater basins of the Gulf of Maine. The V-shaped 100-m isobath effectively
delineates the steep drop-off from Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank to the deeper basins. The average depth is about
175 m, with a maximum depth of about 200 m to the north.

<TEXT>
 

The GSC becomes thermally stratified during the spring and summer months. Surface waters typically range from 3 to
17
 C between winter and summer. Salinity is stable throughout the year at approximately 32-33 parts per thousand
(Hopkins and Garfield, 1979). Much of the bottom is comprised of silty, sandy sediments, with finer sediments occurring
in the deeper waters. 
The late-winter/early spring mixing of warmer shelf waters with the cold Gulf of Maine water funneled through the
channel causes a dramatic increase in faunal productivity in the area. The zooplankton fauna found in these waters
are typically dominated by copepods, specifically 

C. finmarchicus, P. minutus, C. typicus, C. hamatus, 

and 

Metridia lucens. 

From the middle of winter to early summer, 

C. finmarchicus 

and 

P. minutus 

are the dominant species, which together made up between 60 and 90 percent of the samples described by Sherman et al.
(1987). In late spring, 

C. finmarchicus 

alone makes up 60 to 70 percent of the copepod community. In the second half of the year, both species of 

Centropages 

dominate the waters, accounting for about 75 percent of all copepod species sampled. 
The GSC right whale distribution was described by Kenney, Winn and Macaulay (1994), and the following, unless otherwise
cited, is taken from that manuscript. Right whales occur in the GSC on a strictly seasonal basis_in the spring, with
a peak in May. Only in 1986 and 1987 were a small number of right whales present throughout most or all of the summer. This
corresponds to the atypical copepod density maxima in the GSC and southern Gulf of Maine described by Wishner et al.
(1988) and Payne et al. (1990). The main area of GSC right whale distribution has been in the central basin, generally
in waters deeper than 100 m. There is a persistent thermal front, which roughly parallels the V-shaped 100-m isobath
typically slightly south of that isobath in 60-70 m of water. The front divides stratified waters with warmer
surface temperatures to the north of the front from tidally mixed water with cooler surface temperatures over the
shallower area south of the front (Wishner et al., 1988; Brown and Winn, 1989). Right whales occur in the stratified
waters north of the front, and Brown and Winn (1989) showed that right whale sightings were non-randomly distributed
relative to the front, but were at a median distance from it of about 11 km. Although there are variations between years,
the ``typical'' pattern is for the primary right whale aggregation to occur in the central to western portion of the
basin. Within any one year, the general area of major aggregation is remarkably stable. A gradual southward shift
in the center of distribution occurs as the season progresses. 
Single-day abundance estimates for the GSC, uncorrected for animals missed while submerged, ranged up to 179 individuals
(Kenney, Winn and Macauley, 1994). The total number of photographically identified northern right whales is now
319, eliminating those known to have died, but including some that have not been sighted for several years and that
may be dead (Kraus et al., 1993). Therefore, it is likely that a significant proportion of the western North Atlantic
right whale population uses the GSC as a feeding area each spring, aggregating to exploit exceptionally dense copepod
patches. Given that not all of the 300-350 right whales are seen in U.S. shelf waters each season, it is very likely
that most, if not all, of the northern right whale population use the GSC within any given season, and that every 2-3
years, the entire population of 300-350 northern right whales in the northwest Atlantic may pass through the
GSC. 


Cape Cod Bay: 

The CCB is a large embayment on the U.S. Atlantic Ocean off of the State of Massachusetts that is bounded on three sides
by Cape Cod and the Massachusetts coastline from Plymouth, MA, south. To the north, CCB opens to Massachusetts Bay
and the Gulf of Maine. CCB has an average depth of about 25 m, and a maximum depth of about 65 m. The deepest area of CCB is
in the northern section, bordering Massachusetts Bay.

The general water flow is counter-clockwise, running from the Gulf of Maine south into the western half of CCB, over
to eastern CCB, and back into the Gulf of Maine through the channel between the north end of Cape Cod (Race Point) and
the southeast end of Stellwagen Bank, a submarine bank that lies just north of Cape Cod. Flow within the bay is driven
by density gradients caused by freshwater river run-off from the Gulf of Maine (Franks and Anderson, 1992a, 1992b;
Geyer et al., 1992) and by a predominantly westerly wind. 
Thermal stratification occurs in the bay during the summer months. Surface water temperatures typically range from
0 to 19
 C throughout the year. Salinity is fairly stable at around 31-32 parts per thousand. Much of the bottom
is comprised of unconsolidated sediments, with finer sediments occurring in the deeper waters (Davis, 1984). In
shallow areas, or where there is sufficient current, sediments tend to be coarser. 
Northern right whales were ``rediscovered'' in the CCB in the early 1950s. Right whales have been seen in Massachusetts
waters in most months (Watkins and Schevill, 1982; Schevill, Watkins and Moore, 1986; Winn, Price and Sorensen, 1986;
Hamilton and Mayo, 1990). However, most sightings occurred between February and May, with peak abundance in late
March (Mayo, 1993). Schevill, Watkins and Moore (1986) reported 764 sightings of right whales between 1955 and 1981
in CCB. More than 70 whales were seen in one day in 1970. Hamilton and Mayo (1990) reported 2,643 sightings of 113 individual
right whales in Massachusetts waters, with a concentration in the eastern part of CCB. A number of right whales, including
cow-calf pairs, remained in CCB and Massachusetts Bay during the summers of 1986 and 1987. This was attributed to atypically
dense concentrations of 

C. finmarchicus 

in those years, and low abundances of sandlance, 

Ammodytes 

spp., a planktivorous finfish that also preys on copepods and may be competing with right whales for copepod prey during
recent years (Payne et al., 1990). 
The late-winter/early spring zooplankton fauna of CCB consists primarily of copepods, represented predominantly
by two species, 

Arcartia clausi 

and 

A. tonsa. 

Samples taken in the daytime indicated greater densities of copepods at greater depths. The copepod 

C. finmarchicus 

is found throughout inshore CCB waters at densities of 100 individuals per cubic meter from 
April through June (Mayo and Marx, 1990). However, Mayo and Marx (1990) found that the density of surface zooplankton
samples collected in the path of feeding right whales during mid-winter was significantly higher than for the samples
taken where whales were absent (median = 3,904 organisms/m3). The threshhold value below which feeding by northern
right whales is not likely to occur in CCB is approximately 1,000 organisms/m3 (Mayo and Marx, 1990). Although year-to-year
variation in the composition of zooplankton was found, feeding right whales were associated with patches of zooplankton
that were dominated by 

C. finmarchicus, P. minutus, C. 

spp. and by cirripede (barnacle) larvae. These authors suggested that, after arrival in CCB when prey is at a maximum
(or at least at a consistently acceptable level), the whales select the densest patches of copepods (Mayo and Marx,
1990). 



Calving and Nursery Habitat of Northern Right Whales 




Cape Cod Bay: 

Schevill, Watkins and Moore (1986) reported 21 sightings of small calves in 12 of the 26 years of their CCB study, including
two calves that may have been born in CCB. Therefore, the CCB may occasionally serve as a calving area, but it is more
recognized for being a nursery habitat for calves that enter into the area after being born most likely in, or near,
the SEUS. Mead (1986) identified Massachusetts waters as second only to the SEUS for documented right whale calf sightings.
Hamilton and Mayo (1990) observed a total of 30 calves between 1979 and 1987, associated with 21 mothers. Schevill,
Watkins and Moore (1986) and Hamilton and Mayo (1990) documented observations of mating behavior and nursing in CCB.



Southeast United States (SEUS): 

The coastal waters off Georgia and northern Florida (the area described as the SEUS) average about 30 m in depth with
a maximum depth of about 60 m. The deepest waters occur along the coast of Florida, just south of Cape Canaveral. Seasonal
water temperatures and salinity for this area are higher than in northern waters. This is a transition area separating
subtropical from the more temperate southeastern marine communities. Large, cyclic changes in abundance and dominance
of plankton species occur seasonally and annually. Annual variation may be so great that short-term monitoring studies
may not be sensitive enough to assess the temporal variability of the plankton community. The recorded preferred
food of the northern right whale, C. finmarchicus, does not occur in these waters, and the area is not considered a foraging
area for northern right whales. 
Between 1989-1992, 31 calves were observed within the SEUS, representing 76 percent of the total number of calves
(n = 41) reported from the North Atlantic during that period (Kraus et al., 1993). The calving season extends from late
November through early March with an observed peak in January. The 30
' blocks of latitude within the SEUS having the greatest density of adult and juvenile right whales occurred
in waters from Brunswick, GA to Jacksonville Beach, FL (Kraus et al., 1993). The presence of females with calves was
primarily limited to the coastal waters between 27
 30
' and 32
 00
'N latitudes. This is consistent with distributions reported by Kraus and Kenney (1991) using historical
sighting data through 1989. 
Since 1980, 153 northern right whales have been individually identified from surveys conducted in SEUS waters. This
represents 48 percent of the known northern right whale population of 319 whales. During this period, 125 of the right
whales observed in the SEUS have also been sexed using criteria described in Kraus et al. (1993). Of the 96 adults observed,
91 were females, one was a male, and the sex of the remaining four was not determined. These 91 females represent 74 percent
of all the photo-identified females who have been reproductively active since 1980. The observed frequency of occurrence
of females in the SEUS is significantly greater than the expected 1:1 sex ratio characteristic of the overall population.
This demonstrates that the population is segregated by sex at this time of the year, and that the SEUS is used predominantly
by females, and females with calves, although several juvenile males have also been observed in recent years. Based
on the number of calves and females with calves in the SEUS since 1980, Kraus et al. (1993) consider the SEUS as the primary
calving area for the population.

Environmental Correlates to Right Whale Distribution in the SEUS

: Environmental features that have been correlated with the distribution of northern right whales throughout the
SEUS include water depth, water temperature, and the distribution of right whale cow/calf pairs and the distance
from shore to the 40-m isobath (Kraus et al., 1993). 

The average water depth at sighting was 12.6 m (SD = 7.1). This shallow water preference is consistent with that recorded
for southern right whales with calves (Payne, 1986). Also, the significant correlation between the distribution
of northern right whales and the distance from shore of the 40-m isobath (referred to as the inner (0-20-m) and
middle (20-40-m) shelf by Atkinson and Menzel, 1985) indicates that right whales in the SEUS are using the nearshore
edge of the widest part of the broad shallow-water shelf characteristic of the Georgia-Florida Bight. The inner shelf
is dominated by tidal currents, river inflow, and interaction with the coastal sounds. The middle shelf, which is
dominated by winds, has less interaction with the coastal environment but is influenced on the outer margins by the
Gulf Stream (Atkinson and Menzel, 1985). This use of the inner and nearshore-middle shelf area by right whales may
provide maximum protection from the wave action that occurs over the outer margins of the shelf. Therefore, the occurrence
of cow/calf pairs in coastal waters of the SEUS may be due, at least in part, to the bathymetry that affords protection
from large waves and rough water. The strong winds and offshore wave activity in the winter SEUS is minimized nearshore
by the relatively shallow, very long underwater shelf (extending almost 105 km offshore) (Kraus et al, 1993). 

The average temperature of 30
' blocks of latitude where right whales have occurred is significantly cooler than those blocks of latitude
within the SEUS where right whales were not observed (14.5
 C vs. 18.5
 C) (Kraus et al., 1993). The inner shelf is not affected by the Gulf Stream during the period when right whales
are present; therefore sea-surface temperature decreases as one moves from the Gulf Stream towards shore. It is difficult
to separate the effects of temperature from depth and proximity to shore, but sighting data indicate that northern
right whales clearly prefer a band of relatively cool water (10-13
 C) within the SEUS. This band is affected by the nearshore processes, including cooler freshwater runoff and
discharge, as described in several chapters of Atkinson, Menzel and Bush (1985). Although little information is
available on right whale physiology, it is hypothesized that the metabolic rate of the whale is affected by water temperature
(Kraus and Kenney, 1991). The cooler, coastal water may provide right whales with the optimum thermal balance for
calving by cooling the female at a time when offshore, Gulf stream affected warmer waters may be too warm for a female
with maximum fatty layers prior to parturition and nursing. At the same time, the coastal waters may be warm enough
not to cause problems for a neonate, considering that the insulating layer of a neonate for the first few weeks is minimal,
as compared to the adult. 

Courtship activities have been observed throughout most of the range of the northern right whale, except within the
SEUS (Kraus, 1985). 



Activities That May Affect Essential Habitat 



Northern right whales are no longer observed in certain areas where they once were found, such as Delaware Bay, New
York Bight and Long Island Sound (NMFS, 1991). The absence of right whale sightings in these areas may be due to several
factors, including: Increased human activities, habitat degradation, insufficient quantities of prey due to habitat
or natural alterations in the physical environment, extinction of an independent breeding group that used these
areas or contraction of the species' range as the population has decreased (NMFS, 1991).

There exists a wide range of human activities that may impact the designated critical habitat for northern right whales
(NMFS, 1991, 1992). Resource uses in the critical habitat areas are currently, and have been historically, dominated
by vessel traffic and fisheries. Vessel activities can change whale behavior, disrupt feeding practices, disturb
courtship rituals, disperse up food sources and injure or kill whales through collisions. Thirty-two percent of
the known strandings of northern right whales since 1970 have been caused by human activities (Kraus, 1990; NMFS,
1992).

Vessels that operate in the areas being designated as critical habitat include recreational and commercial fishing
vessels, commercial transport vessels, passenger vessels, recreational boats, whale-watching boats, research
vessels and military vessels (e.g., surface ships and submarines). Helicopters and low-altitude aircraft also
fly over the critical habitat. Results of human activities that occur within or near the designated critical habitat
for northern right whales, and that may disrupt the essential life functions that occur there, include, but are not
limited to:

1. Mortality due to collisions with large vessels: Seven percent of northern right whales identified have propeller
scars from a large vessel (NMFS, 1992);

2. Entanglement and mortality due to commercial fishing activities: More than one-half of all cataloged animals
have scars indicative of entanglements with fishing gear, resulting in scars, injuries, and death. Fishing nets
and associated ropes may become entangled around a flipper, at the gape of the mouth, or around the tail (Kraus, 1985,
1990). Gill nets are believed to be the primary cause of scars and injuries related to fishing gear, although whales
have also become entangled in drift nets and lines from lobster pots, seines and fish weirs (Kraus, 1985). Fishing
practices and locations may need to be managed more closely when the fishing season overlaps with the presence of right
whales.

3. Possible habitat degradation through pollution, sea bed mining, and oil and gas exploration: Exploration and
development for oil, gas, phosphates, sand, gravel, and other materials on the outer continental shelf may impact
northern right whale habitat through the discharge of pollutants (such as oil, drilling muds and suspended solids);
noise from seismic testing, drilling and support activity; and disturbance of the environment through vessel traffic
and mining rig activity. If these types of activities are proposed, their timing and location may also require special
management considerations, including the establishment and maintenance of buffer zones.

4. Pollutants may also affect phytoplankton and zooplankton populations in a way that decreases the density and abundance
of specific zooplankton patches on which northern right whales feed. In addition, pollution may affect the feeding
patterns and habitat use of other components of the marine ecosystem, which in turn could impact food and habitat availability
for the northern right whale. Pollutants may also have direct toxic effects on the whale. Monitoring of known and potential
pollution and discharge sources in this essential habitat may be necessary to insure that these sources are not affecting
prey species abundance or composition, or the northern right whale's ability to gain maximum benefit from use of the
area.

Turbulence associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense
surface zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. Special vessel traffic management or restrictions
may be necessary in certain areas when northern right whales are present.

5. Possible harassment due to whale-watching and other vessel activities; and

6. Possible harassment due to research activities (on permitted sites and during specified times throughout the
year).

The effect of any of these activities on individual whales or on their habitat could have consequences that may impede
the recovery of the northern right whale population. Therefore, special management considerations may be required
to protect these areas and promote the recovery of the northern right whale. The following are some, but not necessarily
all, of those activities that occur in each of the designated critical habitat areas.



Cape Cod Bay:

 In CCB, vessel traffic associated with the Cape Cod Canal, the Boston Harbor traffic lanes, dredging and disposal
traffic, recreational boating, commercial fishing and whale-watching activities comprise the majority of the
vessel activity in the immediate area. Of these, recreational boating, commercial fishing and whale-watching contribute
greatly to the level of activity in the critical habitat.

Recreational boating begins with the onset of warmer months, particularly in June. Commercial fishing vessels and
gear are dominated by the lobster industry, which does not typically begin its season until the middle of June. Whale-watching
boats, ferries and other vessels increase activity in the area with the onset of warmer weather and the tourist season,
which typically begins in May or June and ends no later than November.

Discharges from municipal, industrial and non-point sources, dredging activities, dredge spoil disposal and sewage
disposal may degrade essential habitat in Massachusetts Bay/northern CCB. The cumulative effects to baleen whales
(including right whales) by these activities may affect the northern right whale in Massachusetts Bay/northern
CCB.



Great South Channel:

 In the GSC, vessel traffic and fisheries constitute the majority of activities within the critical habitat area.
However, in this area, these activities are not contingent on warm weather. Shipping vessel traffic lanes for Boston
Harbor are used throughout the year to import and export metal, salt, fuel and a variety of other products. Similarly,
the commercially important fishing grounds on Georges Bank involve year-round vessel traffic from the mainland
through right whale essential habitat to the fishing grounds. The bottom-trawl is the most dominant type of fishing
gear used in this area. It is not known whether the bottom-trawl, or any other type of fishing gear, has an impact on the
whales' habitat. Mesh sizes used in this area do not pose an immediate threat to the whales' planktonic food supply.



Southeast United States:

 Vessel traffic and fisheries are the major activities in the SEUS calving grounds. Major commercial shipping and
military ports operate throughout the winter/calving area. The majority of commercial fishing vessels that use
the inshore waters to harvest shrimp and other commercially important species use these and other neighboring ports
as well. Recreational boating traffic is also fairly extensive.

Expected Impacts of Designating Critical Habitat



A critical habitat designation directly affects only those actions authorized, funded, or carried out by Federal
agencies. Federal agencies that may be affected by critical habitat designation of these areas include, but are not
necessarily limited to, the U.S. Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NMFS
(including the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) and South Atlantic Fishery Management Council),
National Ocean Service, Office of Coastal Zone Management, Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Navy. For a discussion
of the expected impacts and significance of critical habitat designation, see ``Significance of Designating Critical
Habitat'' in the proposed rule (58 FR 29187, May 19, 1993).



Consideration of Economic and Other Factors



NMFS prepared an EA on its proposed designation of critical habitat, based on the best available information, that
described the environmental and economic impacts of alternative critical habitat designations. The economic impacts
considered in this analysis were only those incremental economic impacts specifically resulting from a critical
habitat designation, above the economic and other impacts attributable to the listing of the species, or resulting
from authorities other than the ESA. Listing a species under the ESA provides significant protection to the species'
habitat through the no-jeopardy standard of section 7 and, to a lesser extent, the prohibition against taking of section
9, both of which requires an analysis of harm to the species that can include impacts to habitat of the species. Therefore,
the additional direct economic and other impacts resulting from the critical habitat designation are minimal. In
general, the designation of critical habitat reinforces the substantive protection resulting from the listing
itself.

Designation of critical habitat in these areas may result in an increase in administrative time and cost to Federal
agencies that conduct, authorize or fund projects in the designated areas. However, these agencies are currently
required to address habitat alteration issues in section 7 consultations, and as a result, any increase in administrative
time or cost is expected to be minimal.



Designated Critical Habitat; Essential Features



NMFS, by this final rule, designates areas essential for the reproduction, rest and refuge, health, continued survival,
conservation and recovery of the northern right whale population. The following areas are designated as critical
habitat:



Great South Channel:

 The area designated as critical habitat in these waters is bounded by the following coordinates: 41

Southeastern United States:

 The area designated as critical habitat in these waters encompasses waters between 31

30
 15
'N and 28
 00
'N (approximately Sebastian Inlet, FL) from the shoreline out to 5 nautical miles.

Modifications to this critical habitat designation may be necessary in the future as additional information becomes
available.



References



Most references used in this final designation can be found in the Final Recovery Plan for Right Whales (NMFS, 1991),
and in the EA. Additional references found in the preamble to this rule are available upon request (see 

ADDRESSES

).



Comments and Responses



NMFS solicited information, comments and recommendations from concerned government agencies, the scientific
community, industry and the general public (58 FR 29186, May 19, 1993). NMFS considered and incorporated, as appropriate,
all comments received during the comment period (ending on August 31, 1993) and all comments received during public
hearings on the proposed rule prior to making this final designation.

During the comment period and at the public hearings, NMFS received a total of 35 sets of comments from regional and
national environmental organizations; county, state and Federal agencies; and associations representing regional
commercial and sport fisheries. NMFS also received more than 50 written and oral presentations (at public hearings)
regarding the proposed designation of critical habitat for northern right whales.

Comments received by NMFS generally fell into one of the following categories: (1) Those who were in favor of the designation
as it was proposed; (2) those who were in favor of the proposed designation, but recommended that additional regulatory
actions be taken at the time of designation to protect northern right whales; (3) those who were in favor of designating
critical habitat for northern right whales, but recommended expanding the boundaries of the critical habitat; (4)
those who were not in favor of the designation because it was not necessary, given the protective measures for right
whales that are being implemented through section 7 of the ESA; and (5) those who were not in favor of the critical habitat
designation because it may lead to further restrictions on a specified activity. 

Most comments received by NMFS from private individuals, environmental organizations, and state agencies supported
the critical habitat designation for northern right whales. Several commenters suggested that the proposed rule
lacked clear conservation measures to ensure the recovery of the northern right whale. Many of the recommendations
were duplicative of those of other commenters; therefore, individual comments were combined and addressed together
below, unless otherwise specified. 



Comment 1:

 One commenter recommended that NMFS designate a Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team for the coastal
calving grounds off Florida and Georgia. The commenter further suggested representative agencies and organizations
that might participate on this team. 



Response:

 On August 26, 1993, NMFS convened a meeting to discuss the monitoring program that needed to be in place to protect northern
right whales on their winter ground, prior to their winter arrival. During this meeting, the Southeastern U.S. Right
Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team was formed. The team consists of representatives from the Georgia Department
of Natural Resources (Chairman); Florida Department of Environmental Protection; NMFS/Southeast Fisheries Center
and Southeast Regional Office; U.S. Navy, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL; U.S. Navy, Submarine Group, Kings
Bay, GA; Georgia Ports Authority; Canaveral Port Authority; Glynn County Commission, Glynn County, GA; University
of Georgia; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), South Atlantic Division; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA); Port of Fernandina, Fernandina, FL; and the U.S. Coast Guard. 

NMFS is also coordinating the development of a Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team for the Northeastern
United States. Recovery Plan implementation for the northern right whale has been ongoing at some level within NMFS,
Northeast Region (NER), since December 1990, and has involved agency staff and scientific experts in the area. The
most recent Massachusetts Water Resources Authority outfall Biological Opinion (issued September 8, 1993), and
associated conservation recommendations, are part of the recommendations and programs that have been instituted
in the NER that address Right Whale Recovery Plan tasks. The Northeast Implementation Team will address the possible
cumulative impacts to right whales from all activities in Massachusetts Bay. 



Comment 2:

 Several organizations recommended that NMFS implement an early warning system, consisting of daily surveys (from
December 1 through March 31) of the known wintering grounds. Several organizations also recommended that monitoring
be conducted along the migratory route of this species. 



Response:

 ``Early warning systems'' for right whales in the southeast United States were first developed through ESA section
7 consultations between NMFS and ACOE, Jacksonville District, as a result of dredging operations at the Navy's submarine
channel at Kings Bay, GA; the Port of Fernandina, FL; the Port of Jacksonville, FL; the Naval facilities at Mayport,
FL; a navigation channel at St. Augustine, FL; and numerous beach disposal projects using offshore disposal sites
throughout this area. Measures to protect right whales have included daily aerial surveys at the time that the dredges
are in operation during the calving season. If a right whale is seen within a 16-kilometer (k) radius of dredge and disposal
areas, dredges and support vessels are required to carry an observer during daylight hours and to reduce speeds at
night to reduce the likelihood of a collision with a whale. However, these precautions were only in place while the
dredging operations were being conducted, not throughout the entire winter calving period. Therefore there were
gaps in the aerial survey coverage, and thus in protective measures for the whales. 

In December 1993, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard 
provided funding to conduct aerial surveys during the remainder of the time that the whales were in the calving area;
the area of concern from the Savannah River south to approximately Jacksonville, FL, was surveyed through March 1994.
The ACOE will continue to provide coverage during those periods when hopper dredges are active. Therefore, the whale
sightings are passed on to appropriate agencies if a survey finds whales in or near a navigational channel, vessels
are asked to proceed at minimum safe operational speeds and communicate locations of the whale so other vessels can
avoid them. This procedure will continually be reviewed and revised through efforts of the Southeast Implementation
Team. NMFS intends to continue cooperative efforts with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, the ACOE, and the implementation
team to conduct daily aerial surveys throughout the calving season and to operate the early warning system to reduce
the likelihood of ship strikes. 

It is unlikely that right whales can be monitored throughout their range for the purpose of protecting them from ship
strikes. NMFS is developing a research program that may include satellite tracking of tagged northern right whales
to determine those areas (winter and summer) where right whales occur, but which are unknown at this time.

Comment 3:

 The following comments were made by several commenters. They all address additional activities that the commenters
felt should be developed to protect right whales, or activities that should be prohibited, restricted or modified,
primarily in the SEUS, to protect the whales further. These comments are addressed together. 

a. Many commenters indicated that restrictions or modifications of shipping lanes and shipping practices need to
be made at the time of designation. The suggested modifications or changes included the seasonal relocation of shipping
lanes, a requirement that vessels entering or leaving ports adjacent to the right whale winter grounds use direct
routes (perpendicular to the shoreline at the port entrance) from December 1 through March 31, restriction of shipping
and vessel speeds to allow whales to avoid oncoming ships or allow ships to avoid hitting whales, and a requirement
of dedicated onboard observers to maintain watch so that vessel collisions with right whales are avoided when ships
are transiting through right whale wintering habitats during months when the whales occupy these habitats. 

b. Several commenters recommended the development of education programs for shipping and public interests. Others
suggested that NMFS provide to the shipping companies illustrated instructions (in many languages) on the importance
of protecting right whales in these waters, and on safe vessel operation in the winter calving areas. They further
suggested that these instructions be posted for the crews of all ships operating in U.S. waters, and that these safety
measures should be enforced. It was suggested that the U.S. Coast Guard should include whale safety in its small boating
course, and in required courses for commercial captains and boat operators. 

c. Several commenters suggested that NMFS should define right whale critical habitat boundaries on NOAA navigational
charts, and the notice of the designation and occurrence of whales need to be included seasonally in the Notice to Mariners
and other publications, alerting shipping interests to the potential presence of right whales in the area at certain
times. 

d. Several commenters recommended that NMFS ban dredging and seabed mining in the right whale calving grounds and
feeding grounds, and along the entire migratory route. Many comments supported restrictions on dredging, if necessary,
to protect right whales; gas and oil exploration and the dumping of contaminated waste within the calving areas described
by the critical habitat boundaries; dumping of contaminated dredge spoils and industrial waste; and the construction
of submerged or emergent structures within known right whale habitats. 

e. Several commenters suggested that the discharge of pollutants at the mouths of rivers that empty into the calving
grounds should be monitored for possible effects on the habitat. 



Response:

 Regarding comments 3a.-3c., the Southeastern U.S. Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team (see Comment
1) formed committees to examine many of the issues discussed in the comments. Committees that were formed cover the
following topics: Education/Awareness; Early Warning Surveys/Communication; Funding of Surveys; Research;
and Relocation of Ocean Disposal Sites. A second meeting of the Implementation Team occurred on December 14, 1993;
the following updates from each of the committees are summarized from that meeting. 

Education/Awareness Committee: The Canaveral Port Authority developed an endangered species pamphlet covering
whales, manatees and turtles, which is being distributed regionally. As a group, the Port Authorities developed
a series of posters describing the time right whales are in their waters, a phone number to contact if a whale is seen,
and mention of right whale habitat. This poster is being distributed by the harbor pilots when they board a vessel for
navigation. 

A standard brochure on right whales in the SEUS has been developed with input from the Georgia DNR, Florida DEP, New
England Aquarium and others. The brochure is designed for boaters (commercial and public), but is also to be given
to ship masters by harbor pilots. The Port Authorities, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, Georgia DNR and Florida DEP can
use this brochure to increase public awareness and education. Financial support for this brochure comes from the
participating agencies. 

The Georgia DNR and U.S. Coast Guard developed a local Notice to Mariners about right whale calving grounds. This notice
is broadcast four times daily by the U.S. Coast Guard on VHF. Broadcasts ran from December 6, 1993, through March 31,
1994. A slightly longer version is published in the local Weekly Notice to Mariners. This notice may also be published
daily, along with the tides and weather, in regional newspapers. The Annual Notice to Mariners also has information
on this subject. 

Several press releases were issued beginning when the first right whales were sighted on December 4, 1993. A regional
press release was also issued describing the implementation team, members, persons to contact if a whale is seen and
other information on the need for protection of right whales in the SEUS. 

The University of Georgia is surveying local groups to ensure that there is no duplication in the development of educational
materials on right whales, and to provide a network to combine and coordinate efforts. 

The Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce suggested that treating a sighted right whale as though it were another ship
(slowing down, changing course and anchoring to avoid collisions with right whales) should be formalized for all
ports in the southeast (i.e., treating right whales as vessels under the nautical rules of the road). They further
stated that injury to, and interference with, right whales can best be avoided by continuing the education of ship's
captains, and through ongoing cooperation between the port, its pilots and the Georgia DNR. 

Early Warning and Communication Committee: An early warning network has been developed with aerial surveys at the
core of the network (see Comment 2). A communication flow chart has been developed to illustrate how information regarding
whale sightings should be channeled between the appropriate agencies/groups. This is currently considered the
best communication scheme for relaying right whale sightings from aircraft to land-based stations, and back to surface
vessels. This communication network is essential to the early warning system and alerts mariners to the presence
of right whales in the SEUS. Information disseminated by this system is updated daily as whales are located during
the aerial surveys.

Regarding Comment 3d., many of the suggested activities may be authorized, funded or conducted by Federal agencies.
The responsible Federal agency active within the range of the northern right whales is required to consult with NMFS
regarding its projects and activities under section 7 of the ESA. If the activity is found likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the species, directly or through habitat degradation, reasonable and prudent alternatives
would be offered that could include restrictions. Even if the activity is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of the species, NMFS is required to provide an incidental take statement that identifies the impact of any incidental
taking of northern right whales by the action agency, and specifies reasonable and prudent measures, and terms and
conditions that must be complied with, to minimize such takings. These measures may include restrictions upon the
activity. In addition, private entities are prohibited from taking an endangered species pursuant to section 9 of
the ESA, which may include harm to the species caused by habitat degradation. In this regard, such activities are already
prohibited as a result of listing. 
Regarding Comment 3e., NMFS agrees that discharge of pollutants at the mouths of rivers that empty into the calving
grounds should be monitored for possible effects on the habitat. A designation of critical habitat may assist Federal
agencies in evaluating the potential environmental impacts of their activities on northern right whales and their
critical habitat. The designation may also help focus state and private conservation and management efforts in those
areas. 


Comment 4:

 Two commenters recommended that a ``distance buffer'' be established around northern right whales. One recommended
that a minimum approach distance of 100m to 300m should be established for all vessels around right whales. 
The second commenter recommended that NMFS establish around every northern right whale, in any area designated as
critical habitat, a 500m radius ``protection zone,'' and prohibit any vessel or person from entering or knowingly
remaining within this zone. The commenter further suggested that such a buffer zone is consistent with similar rules
already adopted by NMFS and cited as examples the minimum distance rule for humpback whales (

Megaptera novaeangliae

) in Hawaii (50 CFR 222.31) and the 5.5 k buffer zone established around Steller sea lion (

Eumetopias jubatus

) rookeries and major haulouts in Alaska (50 CFR 226.12). The commenter continued that such protection zones for the
area designated in Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank would be consistent with existing Massachusetts regulations
(322 CMR 12.00 

et seq.

), which require that no one approach or remain within 500m of a right whale in state waters. 


Response:

 In both cases, the purpose of the suggested buffer zones would be to ensure that northern right whales are undisturbed
as much as possible throughout their range, and to keep vessels far enough away so that there is no danger of a collision
between whales and vessels. Critical habitat designations reflect specific determinate geographical areas containing
physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species. While NMFS recognizes that the area
around each whale is important, it is not appropriately the subject of a critical habitat designation. Rather, such
buffer zones should be established through separate rulemaking, similar to the special prohibitions for humpback
whales in Hawaii. 


Comment 5:

 One commenter suggested that NMFS implement research and monitoring programs focused on: (1) Behavioral changes
(of northern right whales) associated with the possible impacts of vessel traffic, noise and whalewatching; or (2)
the effects of dredging activities and their associated vessel traffic, siltation and noise in the southeastern
United States through continued observation of dredge activity and aerial surveys of right whales in and adjacent
to buffer zones around dredging operations; (3) the impact of pollution on phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance_specifically
the impact of the Boston Harbor effluent outfall; and (4) the effects of whalewatching activities on the northern
right whale. The commenter recommended that, if necessary, NMFS promulgate regulations to mitigate the effects
of these activities. 


Response:

 In addition to the monitoring program implemented by the Southeast Implementation Team, NMFS is developing a 3-5
year research plan that will focus on research needs identified as priorities in the Northern Right Whale Recovery
Plan. The current research program is the result of several meetings that occurred on April 14-15, 1992, in Silver
Spring, MD; June 18, 1993, in Brunswick, GA; and July 16, 1993, in Silver Spring. These meetings established the following
research priorities: 
a. To determine the wintering location(s) of most northern right whales in the northwest Atlantic through the deployment
of satellite tags on selected female right whale; 
b. to determine daily movements within the wintering/calving area. Tagging with VHF tags in the SEUS could determine
the daily movements of these animals. This information could be useful to develop a long-term monitoring program
to reduce ship strikes in the SEUS; 
c. to determine the unknown location of a third summering area. There are three matrilineal stocks of northern right
whales recognized. One of the stocks does not visit the Bay of Fundy, but is seen in the GSC and CCB during spring, and
in the SEUS in winter. Satellite tracking a tagged female from the third matriline (these have already been determined
from mtDNA analyses and photoidentification) in the GSC or CCB in the spring might lead to the location of the other
summer location of northern right whales in the North Atlantic. 
d. to identify ``bottlenecks'' in the rate of recovery. The reasons for the northern right whale's low reproductive
rate relative to southern hemisphere right whales are unknown. One theory is that there is too much inbreeding as a
result of the extremely depleted population. The extent of inbreeding can be determined from genetic/molecular
identification through mtDNA biopsy sampling and sexing using molecular techniques; and 
e. to determine the best location and methods to monitor recovery of this population.

NMFS is not considering broad-based whalewatching regulations at this time, but may consider minimum approach distances
specific to northern right whales as part of the recovery planning process (see Response to Comment 3). 


Comment 6:

 One commenter stated that collisions with ships and entanglement in fishing gear may be rare from the perspective
of total fishing activity and vessel traffic in the various areas. However, at least two right whales were struck and
killed in the past 3 years. That means that about 2 percent (a much higher rate for calves) of the right whales known to
occur in the area since late 1989 have been killed by a collision with a vessel. This percentage may underestimate the
actual percentage struck during the period because many whales, including calves, have been seen with propeller
scars. In the view of the commenter, this information demonstrates a significant risk from the perspective of right
whales in this area, especially since the threat is concentrated on the reproductive core of the population and the
calves, essential for population recovery. 
The commenter recommended that NMFS expand the proposed critical habitat designation to include conservation measures
that would reduce the likelihood of right whales being struck by vessels or becoming entangled in fishing gear. The
commenter continued that the designation of critical habitat will serve as a warning to those who operate ships in
these areas that steps must be taken to reduce the risk of collision with right whales. While finding the steps already
taken by harbor pilots, ports authorities, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, ACOE and others to be encouraging,
the commenter believed that more needs to be done. 


Response:

 NMFS recognizes that the loss of each northern right whale has a measurable impact on this population. The first priority
of the Southeast Implementation Team was to develop a program to reduce or eliminate ship strikes throughout the whales'
wintering area. 
Also, the New England Fishery Management Council (NEFMC) has restricted all commercial fishing in Gulf of Maine Groundfish
Area I, which roughly covers the GSC, because of the importance of the area for haddock spawning from February 1 to May
31, since 1986. The haddock no longer spawn in that area, but NMFS and the NEFMC have recommended leaving the closure
in place for all gillnet gear to protect the northern right whale, and other whale species that use that area in the spring.

NMFS will continue to focus recovery/management efforts on ways to reduce human-induced mortality as a result of
ship strikes and entanglement. 


Comment 7:

 One commenter stated that the continued availability of these areas for use by northern right whales is critical to
the survival of the species. The commenter further stated that under the authority of the Massachusetts Wetlands
Protection Act, Massachusetts has already designated the portion of CCB critical habitat that occurs in Massachusetts
waters as ``Estimated Habitat'' for a State-listed wetland wildlife species. Estimated habitat, under the Code
of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR), 310 CMR 10.37, is defined as the estimated geographical extent of the habitats
of State-listed species for which an occurrence within the last 25 years has been accepted by the Massachusetts Natural
Heritage and Endangered Species Program and incorporated into its official database. 
The commenter also stated that regulations have already been promulgated by Massachusetts law to prohibit vessels
from approaching within 500m of a right whale in State waters. Fishery measures that reduce the risk of entanglements
of marine mammals with fixed gear such as lobster gear and gillnets have also been adopted in Massachusetts. There
are moratoria on gillnet and lobster licenses, a limit on the number of lobster pots per fisherman and limits on the
length of lobster pot trawls and gillnets. Further restrictions on gillnets, some to complement what the NEFMC is
considering to reduce by-catch of harbor porpoise, 

Phocoena phocoena

, are being considered. 
The commenter believed, however, that a designation of critical habitat at the Federal level would extend comprehensive,
interjurisdictional protection to the right whale, a correct approach to conserving the species. The commenter
further stated that since, the proposed rule said ``fishing practices and locations may require special management
considerations when the timing of the fishing season and the presence of the northern right whale overlap,'' NMFS
should work closely with Massachusetts and the NEFMC to assess the need for, and nature of, special management considerations.



Response:

 NMFS recognizes and appreciates the efforts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to protect the northern right whale.
NMFS is establishing a Northeast Implementation Team for the Recovery Plan (see Response to Comment 5). It is the intent
of NMFS to work closely with these teams to determine for, and effectiveness of, special management measures. 


Comment 8:

 One Federal agency supported the proposed critical habitat designation for the northern right whale, but was concerned
that NMFS would be the Federal agency listed as having management responsibilities within the boundaries of Cape
Cod National Seashore. 


Response:

 Designation of critical habitat does not create management responsibilities for NMFS, nor does it give NMFS primary
jurisdiction over Federal lands included in the critical habitat designation. While a Federal agency may undertake
an activity that may affect either the listed species or critical habitat, and may be required to consult with NMFS
pursuant to section 7, it is the action agency that decides whether to initiate consultation. Likewise, the action
agency determines whether and in what manner to proceed with the action in light of its section 7 obligations and NMFS'
biological opinion (See 50 CFR 402.15). NMFS' role is advisory in nature. 
For example, while NMFS has responsibility over this listed species, the National Park Service (NPS) at Cape Cod National
Seashore has major responsibilities for the long-term preservation of Cape Cod's natural resources, including
this federally listed endangered species. As such, the NPS at Cape Cod National Seashore has management responsibilities
within the proposed area of critical habitat that overlaps with the legislative boundary of the Cape Cod National
Seashore. NMFS believes that the NPS and NMFS can work together on issues pertaining to the northern right whale. 


Comment 9:

 One commenter suggested that two of the proposed critical habitat areas violate the prohibition on habitat designation
outside the jurisdiction of the United States. The proposed critical habitat designation in the GSC and portions
of the SEUS exceed the 12 nautical mile territorial sea recognized by the United States.

<TEXT>
 



Response:

 The regulations state that ``critical habitat shall not be designated within foreign countries or in other areas
outside of the United States jurisdiction'' 
(50 CFR 424.12(h)). The critical habitat designation falls within the 200 mile exclusive economic zone of the United
States, and therefore is not outside of U.S. jurisdiction. Furthermore, critical habitat designation may impact
the activities of Federal agencies, which are defined as ``all activities or programs of any kind authorized, funded,
or carried out, in whole or in part, by Federal agencies in the United States or upon the high seas'' 
(50 CFR 402.02). 


Comment 10:

 Several commenters suggested that the northern boundary of the critical habitat, as recommended by the Recovery
Team and proposed by NMFS (58 FR 29186, May 19, 1993), be extended further northward to 32
  N latitude, approximately the mouth of the Savannah River. Based on data examined since the Recovery Team reviewed
and recommended the critical habitat boundaries that were proposed in the critical habitat designation, the commenter
stated that sightings corrected for effort (i.e., the number of right whales counted per survey mile since 1984) indicate
that the number of right whales per mile of transect off St. Catherines Island, GA, was comparable to the number observed
off Melbourne and Daytona Beach, FL, and greater than that off St. Augustine, FL, areas within the proposed critical
habitat. 
Several other commenters requested that no extension of the critical habitat include the mouth of the Savannah River
be incorporated into a final designation until verified information on the presence of the right whale is publicly
provided and a public hearing is held in Savannah, GA, so that the public can have an opportunity to comment. They further
urged that any boundary modification be justified on firm scientific grounds, showing significant benefits to right
whale recovery. 


Response:

 NMFS believes that the most important winter/calving areas known are within the boundaries identified as critical
habitat in the proposed rule. The greatest number and highest densities of right whales have been observed in the Cape
Canaveral region, with the second highest number occurring at the Georgia-Florida border. It is clear, however,
that northern right whales occur outside this area, including near the mouth of the Savannah River, during the winter
calving period and during their late-winter/spring migration northward. 
The monitoring conducted around the mouth of the Savannah River during 1992/1993, and the near-daily monitoring
conducted during the winter of 1993/1994 from Savannah south throughout the SEUS to approximately Jacksonville,
FL, can be used to examine this issue. In these 2 years of monitoring near the mouth of the Savannah River (total approximately
90 days, 20 in 1992/1993 and approximately 70 thus far in 1993/1994) only four right whales have been sighted. The first
sighting, on December 12, 1993, was of three whales moving south. These whales were resighted the following day near
Brunswick, GA. The second and third sightings were also followed by resightings off Brunswick. In these cases, the
time between resightings was only a few days, indicating that the whales were not remaining near the Savannah River
but traveling through the area toward the core of the sighting distribution. Based on these data, NMFS sees no need
to include the area as critical habitat at this time. NMFS recognizes that the sighting data is based on only 2 years
of information, and that distributions between years can vary dramatically. NMFS will continually examine sighting
data and may modify critical habitat boundaries in the future if warranted by additional sighting information. 


Comment 11:

 One commenter suggested that there is a lack of data offered by NMFS supporting the presence of a substantial right
whale population off the Cape Canaveral Florida coast (south of False Cape). The commenter cited information in the
Recovery Plan for the Northern Right Whale, which indicates that only four sightings within the 5nm proposed habitat
have been recorded south of the False Cape area prior to 1989, and questioned whether this is sufficient data on which
to base a designation. 


Response:

 The lack of sightings at the southern end of the designated SEUS area is explained, at least in part, by low sampling
effort in that area. Sightings corrected for effort indicate that the area around Cape Canaveral may be used by right
whales to a greater extent than presented by Kraus and Kenney (1991) and discussed in the Recovery Plan. The data do
not support removal of the area from consideration. 
Given the need to monitor and manage activities that might impact northern right whales in the area of Cape Canaveral,
NMFS believes that it is appropriate to designate this area as critical habitat. The seasonal use, and extent of use,
of any area will be considered during the ESA section 7 process on a case-by-case basis, but at present the area in question
represents the southern limit to the only known calving area for this species, and is therefore considered critical.



Comment 12:

 Another Federal agency supported the proposed designation and submitted comments from the particular perspectives
of the Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS) and the recently designated Stellwagen Bank National Marine
Sanctuary (SBNMS). 
The GRNMS lies to the north and east of the proposed critical habitat boundary in coastal Georgia; and the commenter
recommended that the boundary of the proposed critical habitat be extended northward and seaward to include GRNMS.
The commenter stated that Grays Reef is particularly vital to the critical habitat designation because the waters
off Georgia and northern Florida serve as calving grounds for this species. The commenter also stated that personnel
at GRNMS could provide additional resources for observing and monitoring these whales as part of the Sanctuary's
routine operations, as well as provide substantial support to the education and outreach objectives listed in the
Northern Right Whale Recovery Plan. 
The commenter continued by stating that the recently designated SBNMS overlaps slightly with the proposed critical
habitat area (at the northern end of CCB). The commenter felt that the proposed designation, in conjunction with the
implementation of the SBNMS, would provide additional opportunities for coordinated efforts to enhance the potential
for recovery of this critically endangered marine species. Also, some or all of the ``special management considerations
or protections'' identified in the proposed designation as being potentially required to protect and promote the
recovery of the northern right whale population using the Stellwagen Bank environment (i.e., vessel traffic, fishing,
pollution, mining and gas exploration) are also addressed by the SBNMS management plan. With the exception of fishing,
these activities are currently either regulated directly, or are listed as subject to sanctuary regulation.

Furthermore, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (title III), as amended in 1992, established the
requirement for consultation between the Secretary of Commerce (NOAA) and any Federal agency proposing to undertake
an activity in the vicinity of a National Marine Sanctuary that may result in adverse impacts on sanctuary resources
or qualities, including private activities authorized by licenses, leases or permits. Such consultation must occur
prior to initiation of the proposed activity. From the perspective of administrative structure, therefore, there
are opportunities for both NMFS and NMSP to coordinate their programmatic objectives. 


Response:

 NMFS does not believe that extending the boundary of the SEUS critical habitat seaward to include the GRNMS is necessary
(see Response to Comment 10). However, NMFS does agree that the Grays Reef program could provide additional monitoring
of these whales, substantial support to the education and outreach objectives listed in the Northern Right Whale
Recovery Plan and additional opportunities for coordinated efforts to enhance the potential for recovery of this
critically endangered marine species. 


Comment 13:

 A commenter recommended that NMFS designate Delaware Bay as critical habitat for the northern right whale, stating
that Delaware Bay is habitat that is representative of the historic geographical and ecological distribution of
the species. 


Response:

 The criteria specified under 50 CFR 424.12 to be considered in designating critical habitat, and described in the
preamble to the proposed designation, must consider the requirements of the species, including habitats that are
representative of the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species. Section 3(5)(A)(ii)
of the ESA states that areas outside the current geographical range of a species can be designated if the Secretary
determines that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. The regulations to the ESA interpret
this provision to mean that the Secretary shall designate as critical habitat areas outside the geographic area presently
occupied by a species only when a designation limited to its present range would be inadequate to ensure the conservation
of the species (50 CFR 424.12(c)). Even where the area is presently occupied by the species, section 3(5)(c) states
that, with certain exceptions determined by the Secretary, ``critical habitat shall not include the entire geographic
area which can be occupied by the * * * species.'' 
Although known to have been used by right whales, it is not completely understood to what extent Delaware Bay was used,
or whether this area would ever have been considered critical habitat. It is known, however, that the area is now bypassed
by northern right whales during their annual movements. NMFS believes that the current high-use areas are identified
in this rule, but recognizes that the areas designated represent the minimal space required by right whales to ensure
population growth. Designating Delaware Bay as critical habitat would not enhance the likelihood of recovery for
this species. If evidence to the contrary becomes available, critical habitat boundaries can be modified. 


Comment 14:

 Several commenters did not oppose the designation of the critical habitat designation for the northern right whale,
but were concerned with the ``general'' language of the proposed designation and felt there was no real need for it.
Rather, they felt that a public awareness program for shipping interests is sufficient. They further expressed concern
that the language of the preamble to the proposed designation stating that ``habitats will be given special consideration
in section 7 consultations'' would become a vehicle to attack offshore dredge disposal and port expansion. The commenters
requested that NMFS reconsider the need for the proposed designation as it applies to the southern coastal area, given
that there is already an active task force working to prevent collisions between vessels and the northern right whale
and that the other protections of the ESA still apply. 
Finally, one of the commenters wanted the channel, fairways to sea lanes, disposal sites, access routes to disposal
sites and nearshore berm areas in the SEUS to be excluded from the critical habitat designation. The commenter noted
that these areas can be excluded if the overall benefits of exclusion outweight the benefits of designation, unless
the exclusion results in the extinction of the species. 


Response:

 Federal agencies active within the range of the northern right whales are already required to consult with NMFS regarding
projects and activities that may affect the species pursuant to section 7 of the ESA. Federal agencies are required
to evaluate their activities with respect to northern right whales and to consult with NMFS prior to engaging in any
action that may affect the critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not likely to result in its destruction
or adverse modification. Regarding the SEUS critical habitat specifically, these actions are being reviewed by
the Southeast Implementation Team, through section 7 consultations and agreements already in place, and through
the expanded efforts of the Implementation Team to reach the private and public sectors. 
Finally, frequent travel by commercial vessels in these areas represents a considerable threat to northern right
whales. Therefore, NMFS does not agree that corridors frequently traveled by vessels within the designated critical
habitat should be excluded. 


Comment 15:

 One federal agency was concerned that the proposed designation was neither appropriate nor necessary to preserve
the species. The commenter felt that the current proposal merely designates areas of highest concentration of the
whales and lists their characteristics, rather than considers the physical or biological features that are essential
to the conservation of the species. To warrant critical habitat designation, the commenter felt that a better understanding
of the species' biological and physical requirements is needed.

Response: 

NMFS agrees that critical habitat designation must include areas meaningful to the specie's conservation. Consequently,
NMFS is not designating the northern right whale's entire range, which was suggested by several commenters, but is
focusing attention on particular areas that have essential features and that may be in need of special management
consistent with the ESA and implementing regulations. The section of this preamble entitled ``Essential Habitat
of the Northern Right Whale'' has been expanded from the proposed rule to address those biological and physical features
and to identify those principal constituent elements, such as feeding sites, breeding grounds and calving areas
within the designated areas, that are considered essential to the northern right whale. The section in the proposed
designation entitled ``Need for Special Management Consideration'' summarizes the justification for the designation
of these three special areas.

NMFS has concluded, based on the best available scientific evidence and the biological and ecological needs of the
species, that the areas in coastal and offshore waters that are being designated as critical habitat for northern
right whales contain the appropriate environmental and biological characteristics required by the species to recover,
and may warrant consideration of special management measures.

NMFS has also concluded that the designation of waters within the SEUS is warranted, given the geographic concentration
of northern right whales during the winter/calving period, the extreme endangered status of this species, the importance
of the area to the reproductive potential (recovery) of the species, the possible impacts of commercial activities
on right whales that may require monitoring and the fact that this area may be in need of special management measures.

The potential for special management considerations does not necessarily mandate restriction or elimination of
activities. Close monitoring of activities and additional research also constitute special management considerations.
The existing information, discussed in the preamble to this final designation, supports this designation of critical
habitat.



Comment 16: 

Another Federal agency commenter, citing the EA prepared by NMFS, stated that the direct impact of the designation
affects Federal agencies and only duplicates that protection provided under the section 7 jeopardy provision. According
to the commenter, the primary benefit cited for the proposed designation is increased awareness. The commenter believed
that previous consultations with Federal agencies and meetings with the public have heightened awareness, and therefore,
that more regulations are unnecessary. In summary, the commenter opposed the designation. However, the commenter
wanted to facilitate more progressive conservation of the species and to cooperate in the development of interagency
management plans to reduce impacts to the whales in high density areas. The commenter believed such measures will
allow NMFS and other Federal agencies more flexibility in advancing recovery of the northern right whale.



Response: 

NMFS restates that, while designating critical habitat helps focus the attention of Federal agencies on the importance
of a designated area for an endangered species, state and private agencies may also give special consideration toward
conservation and management actions in these areas. A designation of critical habitat provides some incremental
protection to northern right whales in those cases where the action may not result in a direct impact to individuals
of a listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present, or
when an activity is conducted outside the designated area), but may affect the critical habitat.

Finally, NMFS agrees with the commenter that a more progressive conservation program to protect this species is necessary,
and that the development of interagency management plans to reduce impacts to the whales in high density areas is the
best approach. Therefore, NMFS will continue to work through the Southeast Implementation Team and through ongoing
section 7 consultations to advance recovery efforts for northern right whales in these waters. NMFS appreciates
the efforts that have already been made toward protecting these animals, and believes continued research and management
discussions will result in a cost-effective, flexible program that will enhance the recovery of the northern right
whale.



Comment 17: 

One commenter supported reasonable activities to protect the right whale at an acceptable cost and understood that
the designation will not, in itself, impose additional regulations affecting activities within the habitat area.
The commenter shared the concerns of other port operators that designation of critical habitat may lead to adoption
of rules regulating the speed and routes of commercial vessels which may cause vessels to leave these ports at great
economic cost to the port.

The commenter was concerned that all proposed special management measures that could impose increased costs should
be adequately evaluated to assure that resulting benefits justify those costs, and that measures are implemented
in the most cost-effective manner. The commenter suggested that effective alternative protection methods with
significantly less cost may exist, although it did not provide specific recommendations.

This commenter has joined together with others to institute an education and information dissemination plan designed
to protect the right whale. The commenter believed that this cooperative effort is the method most likely to be effective
in protecting the right whale at reasonable cost in northern Florida and southern Georgia coastal waters.



Response: 

NMFS does not expect any additional restrictions on use of the areas as a result of this designation. Therefore, direct
economic impacts associated with this designation are expected to be minimal.

NMFS agrees that there may be alternative protection methods. The possibility of such alternatives, however, does
not eliminate the need to designate critical habitat. These should be brought to the attention of the Southeast Implementation
Team, which can review and evaluate them.



Comment 18: 

One commenter was concerned about the potential effects of this designation on beach nourishment projects done in
conjunction with the ACOE. Currently the commenter and the ACOE are studying the feasibility of beach nourishment
at several eroding areas of the Atlantic shoreline. The commenter continued that the potential window for beach nourishment
projects has already been limited by the presence of essential nesting habitat for endangered and threatened species
of sea turtle. The nesting seasons runs from May 1 through October 1 of each year, limiting the timeframe for nourishment
projects to the winter months.

Another Federal agency stated that any hopper dredge restrictions implemented to avoid the December through March
time period of right whale calving and presence in the area would be burdensome. The commenter encouraged working
out a timeframe that would allow use of a hopper dredge and take into account the winter right whale calving season and
the summer period of high abundance for Kemp's ridley turtle (

Lepidochelys kempii

) and manatee (

Trichechus manatus

) in the Kings Bay area.



Response: 

NMFS realizes that the present dredging period was scheduled to accommodate the presence of several species of sea
turtles in these waters, and also recognizes the seasonal limits for beach nourishment projects. The present seasonal
restriction on dredging is an essential management measure, given the increased densities of sea turtles in coastal
waters during the warmer months.

The designation of critical habitat for right whales will not affect the scheduling of this activity. NMFS does not
intend to alter the present schedule through this designation, but rather will continue to require the present level
of monitoring of dredging activities during winter months to reduce impacts to northern right whales. Over the years,
there have been several very near misses of right whales with dredges that were avoided due, at least in part, to observer
coverage on the dredges.



Comment 19: 

Several organizations and individuals had comments regarding commercial fishing restrictions. One commenter
recommended seasonal restrictions on set-gillnet fisheries and multiple trap American lobster, 

Homarus americanus, 

fisheries within known right whale habitat, and felt that fines and enforcement procedures for individuals violating
this and other restrictions should be mandated.

Another commenter recommended that NMFS expand the rule to include conservation measures to reduce the likelihood
of right whales being struck by boats or becoming entangled in fishing gear. Specifically, the commenter recommended
that NMFS prohibit the use of unattended drift and sink gillnets in all three areas being designated as critical habitat
during the seasons that right whales are likely to occur in the area.

Another commenter suggested that unattended use of gillnets should be prohibited from December 1 through March 31
(the time that northern right whales are in the area), but that commercial fishing need not be restricted on the winter
grounds.

NMFS also received several comments from individuals and organizations recommending against designating critical
habitat because they believed it would lead to further restrictions of fishing activities. One such commenter asserted
that the desigation may eventually result in the halting of recreational fishing outside Sebastian Inlet, FL, and
for that reason was opposed to designating critical habitat. Another commenter felt that the designation of critical
habitat would increase regulation of commercial fishing and for that reason opposed the designation.

Another commenter stated that commercial fishermen throughout the SEUS support efforts to protect the northern
right whale through participating in whale sighting programs, and by radioing positions of whales to other vessels
to avoid collisions. Thus, the commenter felt declaring this area as critical habitat was not necessary to avoid collisions,
and may unnecessarily affect fishermen as well as other commercial activities.



Response: 

As stated in the proposed critical habitat designation, the only direct impact of a critical habitat designation
is through the provisions of section 7 of the ESA, which applies only to those actions authorized, funded or carried
out by Federal agencies. This final critical habitat designation contains no land use or fishing regulations, and
will not directly affect private activities. Even where there is Federal involvement, NMFS anticipates that this
final critical habitat designation, by itself, will not restrict private activities in a manner or to an extent that
these activities are not already affected as a result of the listing of this species as endangered. If, in the future,
NMFS determines that restrictions on human activities are necessary to protect northern right whales or their habitat,
such action would be preceded by an opportunity for public review and comment.



Comment 20: 

One commenter stated that pollutant discharges in CCB may represent a continuous source of degradation to essential
habitats. Sewage discharges, dredging activities, dredge spoil disposal and non-point sources all contribute
contaminants into this relatively shallow and extraordinarily productive environment. The commenter further
stated that the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is in the process of combining, upgrading and relocating
its outfalls approximately 15km out into Massachusetts Bay, or roughly 40km to the north of the critical habitat boundary.
The commenter felt that research should be continued and broadened to address all aspects of the species' biology,
behavior and habitat requirements, as well as the specific sources of pollution that threaten to diminish the quality
of the habitat for northern right whales.

The commenter stated that in CCB there is a need to establish a water quality monitoring program that focuses on endangered
species and incorporates sampling of critical parameters at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales.



Response: 

As previously stated, NMFS is coordinating the development of a Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation Team that
will address the possible impacts to right and humpback whales from activities in Massachusetts Bay that may affect
CCB (see Comment 5).

Comment 21: 

One Federal agency outlined those protective measures that have been developed over the years through ESA section
7 consultations with NMFS and commended the efforts of NMFS, Southeast Regional Office, in initiating discussions
with EPA, Region IV, to propose moving the Kings Bay ocean dredged material disposal site closer to the navigation
channel. A closer disposal site would reduce the distance traveled by hopper dredges, thereby reducing the potential
for collisions with right whales. 

The commenter did not anticipate additional restrictions on these activities because of the critical habitat designation.




Response: 

NMFS will continue to work with all Federal agencies through the section 7 consultation process on all protected species
issues to ensure the continued recovery and protection of endangered and threatened species. 



Classification 



It has been determined that this rule is not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

NOAA Administrative Order 216-6 states that critical habitat designations under the ESA generally are categorically
excluded from the requirements to prepare on EA or Environmental Impact Statement. However, in order to more clearly
evaluate the minimal environmental and economic impacts of critical habitat designation versus the alternative
of a no-critical habitat designation, NMFS has prepared an EA. Copies of the EA are available on request (see

Summer Flounder Fishery 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement Amendment 6 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery
(FMP). This amendment modifies the minimum mesh-size requirement, the schedule for establishing the annual recreational
fishery management measures, and the dimensions of the fish box or tote; provides for an experimental fishery; and
prohibits the use of twisted mesh and interference with observers and sea samplers. The intended effects are to minimize
the effects of regulatory restrictions on industry, and to use the best available data to assess the fishery, without
compromising the FMP objective to rebuild the stocks of summer flounder. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



Amendment 6 was prepared by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) in consultation with the Atlantic
States Marine Fisheries Commission and the New England and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils. A proposed
rule to implement the amendment was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8592). Copies of the amendment are available from the Council upon request (see 

ADDRESSES

). The amendment revises management of the summer flounder (

Paralichthys dentatus

) fishery pursuant to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, as amended (Magnuson Act). 

Background concerning the development of the management measures contained in Amendment 6 and the reasons they were
adopted by the Council were provided in the preamble of the proposed rule and are not repeated here. 

NMFS approved Amendment 6, which allows vessel operators to: (1) Carry nets with different size mesh on board their
vessels; and (2) exceed the minimum-mesh seasonal summer flounder threshold amounts, as long as all nets that do not
meet the minimum-mesh requirement are appropriately stowed once the threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained.
Once stowed, these nets cannot be used for the remainder of the fishing trip. 

NMFS is also implementing a regulation that allows the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), to
authorize an experimental fishery to collect management information in certain circumstances to give effect to
section 9.4.2 of the FMP regarding information and data needs. The Council is particularly interested in having additional
mesh studies conducted to augment the results of the mesh studies done in New York and New Jersey. However, the Council
was firm in its intent that no experimental fishery should result in a quota being exceeded. This restriction maintains
the integrity of the mortality reduction schedule for summer flounder, the main objective of Amendment 2. 

This rule also implements a prohibition on the use of twisted mesh. Nets constructed of twisted mesh, when towed, do
not conform to the minimum-mesh requirement and violate the prohibition found at  625.8(a)(6). The addition
of this prohibition conforms the summer flounder regulations with the Northeast multispecies regulations found
at 50 CFR part 651. Such conformity is desirable since multispecies and summer flounder can be caught on the same fishing
trip. The Council adopted another provision that is also implemented in this final rule which modifies the dimensions
of the fish box or tote, referred to in  625.25(d), to conform to those used in the Northeast multispecies regulations.


This rule revises the prohibition found at  625.8(c)(9) to prohibit interference with a sea sampler or observer
on board a vessel for any purpose, and not just for the activities under   625.26 and 625.27, as currently
expressed in this prohibition. Observers placed on board a vessel engaged in an experimental fishery should have
the same protection afforded to other observers and sea samplers. 

NMFS is also modifying the annual fishing measures schedule found at  625.20(c). The date on which recreational
fishing measures are to be published in the 

Federal Register

 is changed to February 15 to allow recreational fishery data from the previous year to be included in the assessment
and monitoring process. The total allowable removals from the stock, which are translated into a coastwide commercial
quota and a recreational harvest limit, as well as additional measures for the commercial fishery, must be published
on or before October 15 of each year. This is the latest date that these measures can be announced in the form of a proposed
rule or a proposed specification and still allow the states an opportunity to implement them on January 1 of each year.
Marine recreational survey data, which allow the recreational harvest limit to be converted into a possession limit
and a recreational fishing season, are not available until late each calendar year.

Comments and Responses 



One comment in support of Amendment 6 was received during the public comment period. The commenter believed that the
amendment is a vital part of the preservation of the mixed trawl fishery and will contribute to the overall safety of
vessels participating in the fishery. NMFS agrees with these comments. 

No negative comments were received during the public comment period. 



Classification 



This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

When this rule was proposed, the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration
that this rule, if adopted as proposed, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities for the reasons set forth in the RIR prepared by the Council. A copy of the RIR may be obtained from the Council
(see 

ADDRESSES

). As a result, an IRFA was not prepared. 

Sections 625.8(a)(6) and (a)(7), the removal of paragraph (c) of  625.24, redesignation of paragaphs (d) and
(e) of 625.24 as paragraphs (c) and (d),  625.24(f), and  625.25(d) are effective immediately. Sections
625.8(a)(6) and (a)(7), the removal of paragraph (c) of  625.24,  625.24(f), and 
 625.25(d) relieve restrictions on the fishery by allowing more than one net on board, if properly stowed, or
allow varying amounts of summer flounder on board, or both, and under section 553(d)(1) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), are not subject to a 30-day delay in effective date. The redesignation of paragraphs (d) and (e) to paragraphs
(c) and (d) in  625.24 is not substantive and under section 553(d) is not subject to a 30-day delay in effective
date.

flounder resource or fishery. 

(b) The Regional Director may not grant such exemption unless he/she determines that the purpose, design, and administration
of the exemption is consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable
law, and that granting the exemption will not: 

(1) Have a detrimental effect on the summer flounder resource and fishery; or 
(2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or 
(3) Create significant enforcement problems. 
(c) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing activity is subject to all provisions of this
FMP except those necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. The exemption will be specified
in a letter issued by the Regional Director to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. This letter must
be carried aboard the vessel seeking the benefit of such exemption.

Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Pacific halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces Pacific halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the second half of 1994. Publication of
these bycatch rate standards is necessary under regulations implementing the vessel incentive program. This action
is necessary to implement the bycatch rate standards that must be met by individual trawl vessel operators who participate
in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries under the incentive program. The intent of this action is to reduce prohibited
species bycatch rates and promote conservation of groundfish and other fishery resources.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
area (BSAI) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA) are managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan
(FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI and the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA. The FMPs were prepared by the North
Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act. The FMPs are implemented by regulations for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations
that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 



Regulations at   672.26 and 675.26 implement a vessel incentive program to reduce halibut and red king
crab bycatch rates in the groundfish trawl fisheries. Under the incentive program, operators of trawl vessels must
comply with Pacific halibut bycatch rate standards specified for the BSAI and GOA midwater pollock and ``other trawl''
fisheries, and the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``bottom pollock'' fisheries. Vessel operators also must comply with
red king crab bycatch standards specified for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``other trawl'' fisheries in Bycatch Limitation
Zone 1 (defined in  675.2). The fisheries included under the incentive program are defined in regulations at
  672.26(b) and 675.26(b). 

Regulations at   672.26(c) and 675.26(c) require that halibut and red crab bycatch rate standards for
each fishery monitored under the incentive program be published in the 

Federal Register

. Any vessel operator whose monthly bycatch rate exceeds the bycatch rate standard is in violation of the regulations
implementing the incentive program. The standards are in effect for specified seasons within the 6-month periods
of January 1 through June 30, and July 1 through December 31. For purposes of calculating vessel bycatch rates under
the incentive program, the periods specified as 1994 fishing months were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65556). 

Halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the first half of 1994 also were published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 15, 1993. At its April 1994 meeting, the Council recommended bycatch rate standards for the second half
of 1994. These standards are set forth in Table 1. As required by   672.26(c) and 675.26(c), the Council's
recommended bycatch rate standards for July 1 through December 31 are based on the following information and considerations:


1. Previous years' average observed bycatch rates; 

2. Immediately preceding season's average observed bycatch rates; 

3. The bycatch allowances and associated fishery closures specified under   672.20(f) and 675.21; 

4. Anticipated groundfish harvests; 

5. Anticipated seasonal distribution of fishing effort for groundfish; and 

6. Other information and criteria deemed relevant by the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director).




Bycatch Rate Standards for Pacific Halibut 



With the exception of the GOA ``other trawl'' fishery, the Council's recommended halibut bycatch rate standards
for the 1994 trawl fisheries are unchanged from those implemented in 1993. The recommended 1994 standards are based
largely on anticipated seasonal fishing effort for groundfish species and 1991-1994 halibut bycatch rates
observed in specified trawl fisheries. Council deliberations on seasonal bycatch rate standards assumed that directed
fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using trawl gear would be closed prior to July 1 (59 FR 24361, May 11, 1994). Council
deliberations also considered the August 15 opening date of the 1994 Bering Sea pollock 'B' season ( 675.23(e)).


The recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the BSAI yellowfin sole and ``bottom pollock'' fisheries approximate
the average annual rates observed on trawl vessels participating in these fisheries during the past 3 years (5 kg halibut/metric
ton (mt) of groundfish). 

The halibut bycatch rate standard recommended for the BSAI and GOA midwater pollock fisheries (1 kg halibut/mt of
groundfish) is higher than the bycatch rates normally experienced by vessels participating in these fisheries.
The recommended standard is intended to encourage vessel operators to maintain off-bottom trawl operations and
limit further bycatch of halibut in the pollock fishery when halibut bycatch restrictions at 
  672.20(f) and 675.21(c)(1) prohibit directed fishing for pollock by vessels using non-pelagic trawl
gear.

The Council's recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries (30 kg halibut/mt
groundfish) is unchanged from 1992 and 1993. The Council recommended a 40 kg halibut/mt of groundfish bycatch rate
standard for the GOA ``other trawl'' fishery. This bycatch rate standard was established for the first half of 1994,
but is a 20 percent reduction from the standard implemented for this fishery during 1992 and 1993 
(50 kg halibut/mt groundfish). The Council's action on the 1994 bycatch rate standard for the GOA ``other trawl''
fishery was intended to continue, to support other management measures implemented under an emergency interim rule
(59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) that was extended through August 9, 1994 (59 FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule
to implement these measures after the emergency interim rule expires was published May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). The interim
management measures include: (1) The apportionment of the GOA trawl halibut bycatch limit between ``shallow water''
and ``deep water'' trawl fisheries, and (2) adjustment of directed fishing standards to change the way retainable
bycatch amounts of groundfish species are calculated. 

The bycatch rate standards recommended for the GOA and BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries are based on the Council's intent
to simplify the GOA and BSAI incentive program by specifying a single bycatch rate standard for the aggregate trawl
fisheries that are not assigned fishery-specific bycatch rate standards under the incentive program, yet maintain
the Council's objective of reducing overall halibut bycatch rates in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries. Observer
data collected from the 1993 GOA ``other trawl'' fishery show third and fourth quarter halibut bycatch rates of 34
and 38 kg halibut/mt of groundfish, respectively. The first quarter rate from 1994 was lower, at 
11 kg halibut/mt of groundfish. Observer data collected from the 1993 BSAI ``other trawl'' fishery show third and
fourth quarter halibut bycatch rates of 5 and 4 kg halibut/mt of groundfish, respectively. The average first quarter
rate from the 1994 BSAI ``other trawl'' fishery was 9 kg halibut/mt groundfish. The average bycatch rates experienced
by vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries are lower than the Council's recommended bycatch
rate standards for these fisheries. However, the Council determined that its recommended halibut bycatch rate standards
for the ``other trawl'' fisheries would continue to provide an incentive to vessel operators to avoid unusually high
bycatch rates while participating in these fisheries and contribute towards an overall reduction in halibut bycatch
rates experienced in the Alaska trawl fisheries. 



Bycatch Rate Standards for Red King Crab



The Council's recommended red king crab bycatch rate standard for the yellowfin sole and ``other trawl'' fisheries
in Zone 1 of the Bering Sea subarea is 2.5 crab/mt of groundfish during the second half of 1994. This standard is the same
as that recommended for 1992 and 1993 and for the first half of 1994. The justification for this standard is discussed
in the December 15, 1993, publication of bycatch rate standards for the first half of 1994. 

Vessels are not anticipated to participate in either the yellowfin sole or ``other trawl'' fisheries in Zone 1 during
the second half of 1994 because of fishery closures. Directed fishing for yellowfin sole in Zone 1 by vessels using
trawl gear is closed for the remainder of 1994 because the Zone 1 

C. bairdi

 Tanner crab bycatch allowance specified for this fishery has been reached (59 FR 26145, May 19, 1994). Directed fishing
for groundfish species included in the ``other trawl'' fishery (defined at  675.26(b)(4)) also is prohibited
in Zone 1 because of halibut, red king crab, or 

C. bairdi

 Tanner crab bycatch restrictions (rockfish, Greenland turbot, sablefish, arrowtooth flounder (59 FR 7656, February
16, 1994); rock sole and other flatfish (59 FR 10082, March 3, 1994); and Pacific cod (59 FR 23461, May 11, 1994)). Nonetheless,
NMFS is publishing a red king crab bycatch rate standard for the ``other trawl'' fishery in Zone 1 consistent with regulations
at  675.26(c). 

The Regional Director has determined that Council recommendations for bycatch rate standards are appropriately
based on the information and considerations necessary for such determinations under   672.26(c) and
675.26(c). Therefore, the Regional Director concurs with the Council's determinations and recommendations for
halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the second half of 1994 as set forth in Table 1. These bycatch rate
standards may be revised and published in the 

Federal Register

 when deemed appropriate by the Regional Director, pending his consideration of the information set forth at   672.26(c)(2)(v)
and 675.26(c)(2)(v). 



Classification 



This action is taken under 50 CFR 672.26 and 675.26. 

This action is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This final rule establishes regulations for seasons, bag limits, methods, and means related to taking of wildlife
for subsistence uses during the 1994-1995 regulatory year. The rulemaking is necessary because Subpart D is
subject to an annual public review cycle. This rulemaking replaces the wildlife regulations included in the ``Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D_1993-1994 Subsistence Taking of Fish and Wildlife
Regulations'', which expire on June 30, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111-3126) requires
that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program to grant
a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska enacts
and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence
definition, preference, and participation specified in sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented
a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December
1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 

McDowell

 v. 

State of Alaska

 that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The Court's ruling
in 

McDowell

 required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance
with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990.

As a result of the 

McDowell

 decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990,
responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 27114-27170). Consistent with subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board
(Board) was established to administer the Federal subsistence management program. The Board's composition includes
a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional
Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State
Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska
Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations
for subparts A, B, and C, and the annual subpart D regulations. All Board members have reviewed this final rule and agree
with its substance. Because this final rule relates to public lands managed by an agency or agencies in both the Departments
of Agriculture and the Interior, identical text will be incorporated into 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100.

On June 1, 1993, the 1993-1994 Seasons and Bag Limits for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands
in Alaska were published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 31252-31295). That rulemaking amended subpart D of 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100.

Over the course of the 1993-1994 regulatory year, the Board executed 6 special actions on the 1993-1994
subpart D regulations. Two of those actions were emergency or temporary closures enacted to protect the continued
viability of particular wildlife populations or herds. The Board also established season dates for Federal subsistence
hunts for moose in Unit 18, caribou in Unit 12, and muskox in Unit 26.

Proposed subpart D regulations for the 1994-1995 seasons and bag limits, and methods and means were published
on September 2, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 46678-46706). A 60-day comment period providing for public review of the proposed rule was advertised
by mail, radio, and newspaper. Subsequent to that 60-day review period, the Board prepared a booklet describing all
proposals for change to subpart D. The public then had an additional 60 days in which to comment on the proposals for
changes to the regulations. The Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) met in regional
centers, received public comments, and formulated recommendations to the Board on proposals for their respective
regions. These final regulations reflect Board review and consideration of Regional Council recommendations and
public comments submitted to the Board.



Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils



Pursuant to the Record of Decision, Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, April 6, 1992, and
the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 36 CFR 242.11 (1992) and 50 CFR 100.11 (1992),
and for the purposes identified therein, Alaska has been divided into ten subsistence resource regions, each of which
is represented by a Regional Council. The Regional Councils provide a forum for rural residents with personal knowledge
of local conditions and resource requirements to have a meaningful role in the subsistence management of fish and
wildlife on Alaska public lands. Presently, the Councils are composed of no fewer than seven and no more than thirteen
members who are residents of the region and are knowledgeable of local subsistence concerns. Charters for these councils
were approved and signed by former Secretary of the Interior Lujan on January 19, 1993.

The Regional Council appointments were made with due consideration of adequate geographical, cultural, and user
diversity within each region. As specified in the Council charters, initial appointments were staggered from one
to three years. Subsequent appointments will carry 3-year terms. Appointment terms expire on December 2 of the appropriate
year. Secretary of the Interior Babbitt made the appointments to the Regional Councils on August 11, 1993. The Regional
Councils have a substantial role in helping residents of the region review the proposed rule and make comments on it.
Following publication of the proposed rule, each Council conducted public meetings to develop regulation proposals.
The Regional Councils also conducted a second round of meetings to develop their recommendations on the proposals.
The Council Chairs or Vice-Chairs then represented their Council at the Board meeting in April 1994.



Applicability of Subparts A, B, and C



Subparts A, B, and C of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 50 CFR 100.1 to 100.24 and
36 CFR 100.1 to 100.24, remain effective and apply to this proposed rule for subpart D. Therefore, all definitions
located at 50 CFR 100.4 and 36 CFR 100.4 apply to regulations found in this subpart. The identified sections include
definitions for the following terms:



Federal lands

 which ``means lands and waters and interests therein title to which is in the United States''; and



public land

 or 

public lands

 which ``mean lands situated in Alaska which are Federal lands, except_

(1) land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved or validly selected under the Alaska
Statehood Act and lands which have been confirmed to, validly selected by, or granted to the Territory of Alaska or
the State under any other provision of Federal Law;

(2) land selections of a Native Corporation made under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which have not been
conveyed to a Native Corporation, unless any such selection is determined to be invalid or is relinquished; and

(3) lands referred to in Section 19(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.''



Navigable Waters



At this time, Federal subsistence management program regulations apply to all non-navigable waters located on public
lands and to navigable waters located on the public lands identified at 50 CFR 100.3(b) and 36 CFR 242.3(b) of the Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940-22964) published May 29,
1992. Nothing in these regulations is intended to enlarge or diminish the authority of the Departments to manage submerged
lands, title to which is held by the United States.



Subsistence Taking of Fish and Shellfish Regulations



This proposed rule contains no subsistence fishing or shellfish taking provisions. The Board intends to propose
to the Secretaries that the regulatory year governing subsistence fish and shellfish taking activities be changed
from the June 1-July 30 annual cycle to a January 1-December 31 cycle. Such a change may provide more consistency
during those months when fish and shellfish are most commonly harvested. The current subsistence fish/shellfish
regulations will be addressed in a separate interim rule as soon as possible. The interim rule will likely extend the
current regulations until litigation appeals are concluded or the agency is directed to issue revised rules, whichever
occurs first.




Summary of Comments (Proposals)



On September 2, 1993, the proposed rule for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska_Subpart
D, 1994-1995 was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 46678-46706). During the 60-day period to suggest changes for the 1994-1995 regulatory year, the
Regional Councils held their initial meetings in conjunction with public hearings on the 1994-1995 subpart
D regulation proposed rule. Meetings were held in Sitka, Barrow, Bethel, Kotzebue, Fairbanks, Kodiak, Nome, Anchorage,
Naknek, and McGrath. The meetings were used to initiate the Regional Council system and to assist in the development
of suggested changes to the 1994-1995 subpart D proposed rule.

A total of 107 proposals for 1994-1995 subpart D regulations was received. Of those, 88 were within the scope
of the Board's authority under subpart D. Most of the proposals which were not accepted involved requests for changes
in customary and traditional use determinations found in subpart C of the Federal subsistence management program
regulations. Other proposals which were not considered requested delegation of Board authorities that could not
be relinquished to nongovernment entities, or requested application of hunting or fishing regulations to non-Federal
lands or waters. One proposal questioned the entire framework of the Federal Subsistence Management Program, one
requested regulations for waterfowl, and another proposed inclusion of a non-rural Native group within the program.

On November 15, 1993, a booklet describing the 88 proposals was distributed to the public with notice that the Board
would accept public comments on these 88 proposals through January 14, 1994. After the public comment period, the
Regional Councils held meetings in regional centers to obtain local input on specific proposals affecting each region.
Of the 88 proposals, the Board acted on 79 during a public meeting, April 11-15, 1994. The remaining proposals
were withdrawn by their proponent prior to the Board meeting or during the meeting.

The Board did not adopt five proposals requesting relief on method and means restrictions. Of the five proposals,
four were related to the use of designated hunters to harvest wildlife for others, especially the elderly or incapacitated.
The Board recognized that the taking of resources by a few hunters in a community and the sharing of the harvest is a cultural
tradition throughout Alaska. The Board in rejecting these proposals directed the staff to work with the Regional
Councils to develop proposed regulations for the 1995-96 regulatory year that address the situation on a State-wide
basis. One proposal requested liberalization of same day airborne trapping of wolves and other furbearers. Seven
of the Regional Councils recommended rejection of this proposal because the use of airplanes to shoot furbearers
does not constitute a customary and traditional use. Three Regional Councils supported the proposal. Following
the recommendation supplied by seven Regional Councils, the Board rejected this proposal.

Seven proposals to change existing seasons were rejected by the Board because approval of the action was not biologically
justified or would unnecessarily restrict existing subsistence uses. All seven were either not acted upon by the
respective Regional Council because of other pending proposals or were recommended for rejection.

Two proposals to alter existing subsistence moose hunting regulations for Unit 1(B) were rejected by the Board. These
proposals requested removing antler restrictions in the Stikine River area. The Regional Council recommended rejecting
these proposals, and the Board followed the Regional Council's recommendation denying these proposals due to the
declining moose population and concern regarding future harvest.

The Board addressed a proposal to open a moose hunt in Unit 3, but found insufficient customary and traditional use
information to warrant establishment of a moose season without going through a process for making a customary and
traditional use determination.

The Board addressed two proposals to modify the deer season in Unit 4. In addressing these proposals, the Board adopted
another proposal supported by the Regional Council that better addressed the opportunity for both subsistence and
non-subsistence hunters.

Five proposals requesting establishment of seasons for caribou and moose on the Kenai Peninsula (Units 7 and 15) were
deferred, as recommended by the relevant Regional Council, until customary and traditional uses of those species
could be comprehensively evaluated. In the interim, the Board's past action prevents adoption of any new subsistence
seasons on the Kenai Peninsula until the full review of customary and traditional uses is completed.

One proposal was submitted to open Federal lands in Units 11 and 13 to nonsubsistence uses. The Regional Council recommended
that the Board reject this proposal because of potential adverse impacts on a declining wolverine population. The
Board agreed with the Regional Council and rejected the proposal.

One proposal to close Federal lands to non-subsistence uses was considered as three separate proposals to allow a
more detailed examination of each area requested for closure. All three were rejected: two were deferred at the request
of the Regional Council to allow for more study, and the third was deferred because administrative changes may resolve
perceived conflicts. In the third area, uses will also be closely monitored and will be reviewed during the next regulatory
cycle.

Three proposals dealt with the reestablishment of a special Lime Village Management Area, a revision in the harvest
system from a community to an individual system, and the establishment of a State permit system. After considerable
deliberation, with the support of the Lime Village community and Regional Council, and with acceptance of ADF&G,
the Board rejected all three, retaining the present subsistence regulations for the area and emphasizing a community
harvest reporting system.

Two proposals dealing with moose in Unit 19(A) and 21(E) were deferred until the next Board meeting because an adjacent,
affected Regional Council had not had the opportunity to make recommendations on the proposals.

Two proposals on Dall Sheep in Units 23 and 26, proposing boundary adjustments and horn curl restrictions, were rejected
based on Regional Council recommendations that the additional curl restrictions would adversely impact subsistence
uses. The boundary modifications were handled in another proposal.

To assure the continued viability of the Chisana caribou herd, the Board rejected a proposal calling for a continued
subsistence season on the herd. The Regional Council had recommended that the Board take such action.

The Board rejected two proposals that were adequately addressed in other proposals. This was done in concurrence
with Regional Council recommendations.

One proposal raised the issue of the amount of land in a given area that is necessary to justify establishment of Federal
subsistence regulations. Because there exists no established policy regarding the minimum acreage or Federal/State
land ratios at which Federal authority should be exercised, the Board followed the Regional Council's advice and
rejected this proposal.

All of the adopted proposals were recommended for adoption by the respective Regional Councils and were based on meeting
customary and traditional harvest practices or protecting wildlife populations. Detailed information relating
to justification on each proposal may be found in the transcripts for the Board meeting, available for review at the
Office of Subsistence Management at the address listed previously. 

 Throughout the document, minor editorial revisions were made to simplify wording or reduce redundancy. 

 The Board adopted one proposal that had Statewide impacts. This proposal modified and in many areas aligned
seasons or harvest limits on wolves to correspond with State regulations. The Board generally adopted the Regional
Council recommendations that in some regions modified the proposed season dates. 

 Modifications were made to provide for the harvest of moose for the Nuchalawoyya Potlatch and for the Kaltag/Nulato
Stickdance that the Board had approved at an earlier meeting but had not yet been incorporated in the regulations.

 Closed some Federal lands in Unit 12 to protect the Chisana caribou herd, revised regulations for Units 20(E)
and 25(C) to protest the Fortymile caribou herd, and revised the area descriptions and caribou seasons in Units 20(F)
and 25(C).
 Modified the Unit 25(D) (West) moose regulation to remove the requirement for ``antlered'' bull, modified
the season dates for moose within Unit 25(D) (West), and authorized a four brow tine option to the antler restriction
in Unit 20(A).
 Eliminated the permit requirement for moose in Unit 25(A) within the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area.

Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities



National Environmental Policy Act Compliance



A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence
Management Program was distributed for public comment on October 7, 1991. That document described the major issues
associated with Federal subsistence management as identified through public meetings, written comments and staff
analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts
A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the
proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence
hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February
28, 1992.

Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, the decision made by the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service,
implemented Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940-22964 published May 29,
1992) implements the Federal Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence
hunting and fishing regulations.



Compliance With Section 810 of ANICLA



The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to provide opportunities for subsistence uses subject to the
limitation of protecting healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the
FEIS process. The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that
the Federal Subsistence Management Program, including the annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations,
would have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but would not constitute a significant restriction of subsistence
uses under the ``may significantly restrict'' standard.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements
described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018-0075.

Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average .1382 hours per response, including time for reviewing
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments on the burden
estimate or any other aspect of this form to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849
C Street, NW., MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project
(1016-0075), Washington, DC 20903. Additionally, information collection requirements may be imposed if
the Regional Councils and Local Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established
under Subpart B. Such requirements will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.



Economic Effects



This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under E.O. 12866.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
of the Interior and Agriculture have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect
on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant.

These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings
implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630.

of grouse and ptarmigan are also regulated by the number that can be held in possession.
(7) Unless otherwise provided, any person who gives or receives wildlife shall furnish, upon a request made by a Federal
or State agent, a signed statement describing the following: names and addresses of persons who gave and received
wildlife, the time and place that the wildlife was taken, and identification of species transferred. Where a qualified

XX

.25(c)(10)(ii) does not apply to the carcass of an ungulate that has been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise
prepared for consumption upon arrival at the location where it is to be consumed.
(iii) If a moose harvest limit includes an antler size or configuration restriction, no person may possess or transport
the moose carcass or its parts unless both antlers accompany the carcass or its parts. A person possessing a set of antlers
with less than the required number of brow tines on one antler shall leave the antlers naturally attached to the unbroken,
uncut skull plate; however,  

XX

.25(c)(10)(iii) does not apply to a moose carcass or its parts that have been butchered and placed in storage or otherwise
prepared for consumption after arrival at the place where it is to be sorted or consumed.
(d) A person who takes an animal that has been marked or tagged for scientific studies must, within a reasonable time,
notify the ADF&G or the agency identified on the collar or marker, when and where the animal was taken. Any ear tag,
collar, radio, tattoo, or other identification must be retained with the hide until it is sealed, if sealing is required;

the Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, Unit 5, or Unit 9(B) need not be sealed unless removed from the area.
(3) A person who possesses a bear shall keep the skin and skull together until a representative of the ADF&G has
removed a rudimentary premolar tooth from the skull and sealed both the skull and the skin; however, this provision
shall not apply to brown bears taken within the Western Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, the Northwest Alaska Brown
Bear Management Area, Unit 5, or Unit 9(B) which are not removed from the Management Area or Unit.

moose hunting, including transportation of moose hunters or parts of moose from Aug. 1_Aug. 31 and from Jan. 1_Mar.
31. No hunter may take or transport a moose, or part of a moose in Unit 26(A) after having been transported by aircraft
into the unit. However, this does not apply to transportation of moose hunters or moose parts by regularly scheduled
flights to and between villages by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this area, nor does it apply
to transportation by aircraft to or between publicly owned airports;
(B) The Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area, which consists of those portions of Units 20, 24, 25, and 26 extending
five miles from each side of the Dalton Highway from the Yukon River to milepost 300 of the Dalton Highway, is closed
to the use of motorized vehicles, except aircraft and boats, and to licensed highway vehicles, snowmobiles, and firearms
except as follows: The use of snowmobiles is authorized only for the subsistence taking of wildlife by residents living
within the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area. The use of licensed highway vehicles is limited only to designated
roads within the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area. The use of firearms within the Corridor is authorized only
for the residents of Alatna, Allakaket, Anaktuvuk Pass, Bettles, Evansville, Stevens Village, and residents living
within the Corridor;
(C) The Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, which consists of those portions of Unit 23, except the Baldwin
Peninsula north of the Arctic Circle, Unit 24 west of the Dalton Highway Corridor Management Area, and Unit 26(A),
is open to brown bear hunting by State registration permit in lieu of a resident tag. No resident tag is required for
taking brown bears in the Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area, provided that the hunter has obtained a State
registration permit prior to hunting. Aircraft may not be used in the Northwest Alaska Brown Bear Management Area
in any manner for brown bear hunting under the authority of a brown bear State registration permit, including transportation
of hunters, bears or parts of bears. However, this does not apply to transportation of bear hunters or bear parts by
regularly scheduled flights to and between communities by carriers that normally provide scheduled service to this
area, nor does it apply to transportation of aircraft to or between publicly owned airports.
(iii) Unit-specific regulations;
(A) Motor-driven boats and snowmachines may be used to take caribou; however, shooting from a snowmachine in motion
is prohibited.

SUMMARY: 

This final interpretive ruling and policy statement (``IRPS'') is the result of NCUA's policy of reevaluating all
its regulations periodically to determine whether change is warranted. The NCUA Board approved publication of a
proposed IRPS on chartering and field of membership after its July 15, 1993 open meeting; the public ultimately was
given 180 days to submit comments. This final IRPS 94-1 reflects a full evaluation of those comments; substantial
changes as outlined below were made to the proposal. This IRPS 94-1 replaces IRPS 89-1.


The NCUA is also issuing a final amendment to update Part 701.1 of its Rules and Regulations entitled ``Organization
and Operations of Federal Credit Unions''.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background


I. The Proposed IRPS


On July 28, 1993, the NCUA Board published a proposed interpretive rule and policy statement (IRPS) updating chartering
and field of membership policies, and also published a proposed amendment to Section 701.1 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations
(12 CFR 701.1), to reference the updated IRPS. The proposal was issued with a 90 day comment period that was extended
by the NCUA Board for an additional 90 days due to a public request. The proposed IRPS was designed: (1) To update policies
on low-income credit unions; (2) to streamline the charter application process; (3) to address credit unions undergoing
corporate and military unit restructuring; (4) to clarify NCUA policy on the ``operational area'' requirement for
select group expansions; and (5) to make certain other minor or technical changes to modify or clarify NCUA policy.
The Board also requested specific comment on the following issues: (1) Whether NCUA should permit credit union chartering
and field of membership expansions based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union
service available to low-income persons, such as is now permitted for existing credit unions seeking to extend service
to senior citizens; (2) Whether NCUA should permit occupational, associational, and multiple group federal credit
unions to add to their fields of membership communities satisfying the ``low-income credit union'' definition found
in Part 701.32 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations; (3) Whether there should be special procedures for permitting select
group expansions ``in the public interest;'' and (4) Whether NCUA should establish a streamlining ``file and serve''
procedure for select group expansions of fewer than 50 potential members.

II. Summary of Comments Received



One hundred and thirty-nine public comment letters were received. Comments were received from seventy-eight federal
credit unions, six state chartered credit unions, one state regulator, thirteen state credit union leagues, seven
national credit union trade organizations, and two individuals.

The Board also received comments from thirty-two banks and banking associations. Briefly summarized, the bank commenters
argued that federal credit unions are permitted to expand only within a single common bond, and that federal credit
unions should be subject to tax like banks. The NCUA Board, in currently ongoing litigation, has repeatedly stated
its disagreement with banking organizations' position on various matters regarding field of membership issues.
The question of taxation has been decided by Congress and the President.

In general, the credit union commenters partially supporting or opposed to the proposal argued that NCUA should go
even further in liberalizing chartering and field of membership policy. For example, the vast majority of commenters
favored deleting operational area requirements altogether for select group amendments. Though the credit union
community's desire for more flexibility in accepting new members is understandable, the NCUA Board is unwilling
to make the significant changes suggested in operating rules that have served the community well for so long. The Board,
in the final IRPS, has adopted a more conservative approach to change.

At the same time, the Board has noted the continuing decline in the number of credit unions and the lack of new chartering
activity in recent years. The final IRPS makes significant changes to existing policy to encourage new chartering
activity, particularly in low-income areas.

THE ISSUES AND NCUA BOARD DECISIONS


I. Field of Membership Changes To Promote Service to Low-Income Persons


A. Comments in General


The Board's suggestions for significantly liberalizing field of membership policy to encourage service to low-income
persons by any sector of the credit union movement generated a great deal of interest.
The first suggestion was to permit credit union chartering and field of membership expansion based on associational
groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons, much as is now permitted
for existing credit unions seeking to extend service to senior citizens. Nineteen commenters approved of this proposal
as a proper method to increase financial services to low-income individuals. However, one association commenter
stated that in the case of a low-income credit union, it would oppose a low-income ``association'' seeking to align
with such a non low-income credit union if the association's constituents were already eligible for membership in
an existing low-income credit union, unless the latter did not object. This commenter asked whether it was NCUA's
intent that the individuals of this associational group themselves be low-income or simply have a stated interest
in making services available to low-income persons. This commenter also asked what method of income documentation
NCUA would require for the association and whether all of the proposed members would have to qualify as low-income
or simply a majority. Four commenters opposed this proposal as unnecessary.
The Board also requested comment on a proposal to permit occupational, associational, and multiple group federal
credit unions to add to their fields of membership communities satisfying the ``low-income credit union'' definition
of Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. Thirty commenters approved of this proposal. Most of these commenters believed
that it would allow healthy credit unions to help low-income individuals. Two commenters stated that in many cases
credit unions are the only financial institutions that are willing to work with low-income individuals in an effort
to promote fiscal responsibility. Two commenters believed there was reason to limit this proposal to non-community
credit unions. These commenters believed there may be instances when it would be appropriate for a community credit
union to serve a non-contiguous low-income community. Furthermore, these commenters suggested that any credit
union wishing to serve a low-income group or community should include in its business plan details on how it will serve
the group and periodically review how successful its efforts have been.
Eight commenters opposed the proposal. Three commenters believed there would be a potential for the credit union
to ``cherry pick'' low-income neighborhoods without truly being dedicated to its development.
Two commenters suggested that the credit union maintain separate accounting records for the low-income addition,
and at a later date, if the low-income addition was successful, it could be spun off and stand on its own. One commenter
suggested that ``persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress'' in a designated community
also be considered an acceptable group for additions. Five commenters suggested it might be possible to charter new
community development credit unions that would immediately operate under the agency's conservatorship policies_perhaps
for a minimum period of three years. The commenters also suggested that under NCUA's broad conservatorship powers,
NCUA could hire the services of a nearby existing credit union under a management contract to operate the new credit
union.
One commenter stated that minimum requirements should be instituted for any non-low-income credit unions seeking
permission to enter a low-income area to ensure that the community will be adequately served. One commenter suggested
that a non low-income credit union be required to provide status reports on its service to such a low-income group.
One commenter recommended that no expansion should be granted unless it could be demonstrated that there would be
no adverse material impact on existing low-income credit unions in the area, or groups in the process of chartering
a low-income credit union. One commenter stated that before an expansion was granted, the federal credit union should
be required to perform a study of the credit and depository needs of the low-income group.

One commenter supported using the existing limited income designation criteria as defined by NCUA to allow existing
religious-based credit unions to grant access to credit union service in their immediate financially underserved
communities. One commenter recommended allowing minority chambers of commerce or other associations of minority
and economically disadvantaged business people, along with their respective employees, to qualify for charters.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The Board agrees that low-income persons need expanded credit union service. To ensure that all possible means of
accomplishing this end can be used, the final IRPS:

 Permits chartering associational low-income federal credit unions, where the association is organized
solely for the purpose of providing credit union service to low-income persons.

 Permits a low-income federal credit union, whether associational or community based, to include in its charter,
occupational, associational, and community common bond groups without regard to location. The credit union will
have to monitor such additions to its base common bond, however, to ensure that the credit union remains qualified
for a low-income credit union designation.
 Permits a federal credit union of any type_occupational, associational, community, or multiple group_to
include low-income groups in its field of membership, without regard to the groups' location, either by forming an
association which is organized solely for the purpose of providing such service or by including a community group
which could be the basis for chartering a low-income credit union.

The Board shares some commenters' concerns that this policy change may be used to ``cherry pick'' by meeting the credit
needs of a relatively well-off portion of a low-income community while leaving those most in need of service with nothing.
The Board will institute special reporting requirements and special examination procedures for any credit union
including a low-income group in its field of membership to ensure that adequate credit union services are provided
to 

all

 persons in the community.

The Board sees no limitation in the Federal Credit Union Act preventing this policy change. While true that NCUA has
generally refrained from combining community-based common bonds with occupational and associational common bonds,
the reason for that limitation has been a concern for the safe and sound development of credit unions. The language
of Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1759, which states ``Federal credit union membership shall
be limited to groups having a common bond of occupation or association, or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood,
community, or rural district,'' does not require segregation of community groups from other kinds of common bonds.
The difference in wording for community based common bond seems to have arisen from the fact that the bond was more difficult
to describe adequately. The ``or'' between the ``common bond'' provisions and the community description is no different
from the ``or'' between ``occupation'' and ``association'', which the Board has long concluded permits combining
occupational and associational common bonds in a single federal credit union, and which is consistent with the word's
common usage.

Moreover, in IRPS 89-1, the Board described all three groupings_occupational, associational, and community_as
``common bonds'' without distinction, and in the case of distress mergers permitted intermingling of all three common
bond types.

Finally, there is nothing in the evident purposes of the Act which suggests that community groups are necessarily
to be treated differently from other common bonds. Functionally, all three common bonds perform an identical role_to
help maintain in credit union members the sense of belonging and ownership that is so crucial to credit union success.

Other commenter suggestions_such as providing assurances that existing low-income credit unions are not overlapped
and extending the agency's conservatorship power to help start low-income credit unions_can be implemented under
existing policy where appropriate.



II. Other Issues Relating to Low-Income Federal Credit Unions



A. Comments



Four commenters approved of updating low-income credit union polices based on the revised regulatory definition.
Two commenters believed that low-income credit unions should have access to the CDCU Revolving Loan Program immediately
upon beginning operation. One commenter suggested that community groups be able to seek a preliminary determination
of a low-income designation before final submission of a charter package.

One commenter urged that associational groups proposing to start low-income credit unions not be required to demonstrate
voting, dues-paying membership structures because, among other things, it would hurt church based associational
groups.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The Board agrees with these suggestions. The final IRPS:
 Updates the provisions on low-income credit unions to reflect recent changes in the Rules and Regulations
 Eliminates the voting and dues-paying requirements for recognition of an associational common bond
 Provides for preliminary review of the low-income designation.
Part 705 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (12 CFR 705.0 

et seq.

) currently provides qualifying newly chartered credit unions with immediate access to the CDCU Revolving Loan Fund.



III. Streamlining the Process for New Charter Applications


A. Comments


Six commenters approved the streamlining process for new charter applications. Four commenters believed that the
amount of time that passes between the day a potential credit union submits a charter application to NCUA for approval
and the day the application is actually approved or denied was acceptable. Two commenters believed the time frame
for chartering was unacceptably lengthly. One commenter suggested that an acknowledgment of receipt of the chartering
application ``be sent to the organizers in a timely fashion'' preferably within 10 days.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter stated that it would facilitate chartering if groups were able to obtain tentative approval of their
fields of membership early in the process. This commenter also believed that early submission of NCUA 4012 may also
speed the process.

The proposal stated that the subscribers should be responsible for paying the cost of credit reports and background
checks when applying for a credit union charter. Seven commenters agreed with this provision. Nine commenters believed
that the subscribers should not be responsible for paying the cost of credit reports and background checks when applying
for a new charter. Two commenters recommended that NCUA articulate the standards relied upon in disqualifying credit
union organizers.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The NCUA Board agrees with these suggestions and is hopeful that the result of all the changes made will be a significant
increase in new federal chartering activity. Small, vibrant credit unions, serving their members on a first-name
basis and willing to take reasonable credit risks based on personal knowledge of their members' character, are a vital
part of the credit union movement. Many credit unions which used to fill this niche have through their success grown
to the point where credit union management can no longer make these personal judgments on each individual member:
A new generation of small credit unions is needed to fill that void, particularly in the many poor inner-city and rural
areas where credit needs are now largely unmet.

The final IRPS provides:

 That charter applicants will receive acknowledgment of the application's receipt in 10 business days

 That tentative field of membership approval will be given early in the process

 That early submission of NCUA 4012 will be encouraged

 That the cost of credit reports and background checks will be borne by NCUA

The NCUA Board does not believe, however, that it would be productive to establish many other absolute standards and
guidelines. Each application is to some extent unique and may require somewhat different procedures and time frames.
The Board believes these are best left to be worked out between the prospective credit union officials and NCUA staff.



IV. Distress Situations Caused by Dramatic Changes in Economic Conditions Within a Federal Credit Union's Field
of Membership 



A. Comments

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>

The proposal would have permitted an associational, occupational, or multiple group credit union converting to
a community charter as a result of significant corporate or military restructurings to maintain service to groups
in its field of membership prior to conversion and to add other groups within the credit union's operational area after
the conversion, but for only so long as needed to ensure the credit union's continued viability. A group consisting
of all NCUA Regional Directors and the Director of Examination and Insurance would vote to determine the necessity
of allowing the converting credit union to maintain the select employee groups. Eighteen commenters favored the
proposal.
Four commenters believed this authority should be expanded to all community charters where continued viability
is threatened by a major employer's restructuring. These commenters believed there was no reason to treat a ``converting
to'' community charter any different from existing community charters when in both cases the threat is viability
caused by similar events.
Though many commenters suggested abandoning the operational area requirement altogether (see ```Public Interest'
Addition Comments'' below), one in particular urged that it at least be abandoned in distress situations. Eight commenters
opposed the proposal. Two commenters stated that military credit unions should not be granted community charters
except in rare cases where an isolated base is the community. These commenters believed that in a heavily populated
area where there are many other credit unions already serving select groups, this proposal would grant an unfair advantage
to military credit unions. Six commenters approved the special administrative approval procedure but nine objected
to it.


B. NCUA Board Decision


The Board is persuaded that federal credit unions of all types need additional flexibility when faced with distress
situations such as significant corporate or military restructuring. The final IRPS:
 Permits federal credit unions of all types_occupational, associational, multiple group, and community_to
apply for designation as a ``distressed federal credit union'' and to do so regardless of whether they are converting
to community charter
 Permits federal credit unions with such designations to add occupational and associational groups to their
fields of membership regardless of location.
As an added assurance that the process is administered consistently and proper guidance is given, the NCUA Board will
reserve to itself, at least initially, the authority to grant ``distressed credit union'' designations. The Board
believes that, with this added requirement, there will be adequate controls in place to prevent abuse: There will
be a comprehensive review by the NCUA Board prior to initial designation; groups must request service in order to be
added to a distressed credit union's field of membership; the regional director must approve all expansion requests;
and normal overlap procedures will apply.


V. Common Bond Issues


A. Occupational Common Bonds


1. Comments


The proposal suggested only slight modifications of current policy. It stated that a proposed federal credit union
whose primary sponsor is a particular corporation may include the employees of that corporation who work at another
location, employees of the corporation who are paid from or are supervised from the headquarters location, such as
sales persons or sales agents who work at a number of locations, employees of a division or majority-owned subsidiary
of the parent company regardless of location, and employees of a related company (such as a person working regularly
for an enterprise under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with the sponsoring enterprise).
Each group to be served (e.g., majority-owned subsidiaries, contractors) was to be separately listed.
One commenter objected to the proposal that each group to be served must be separately listed. This commenter suggested
that NCUA be more lenient. Another commenter requested that if an occupational credit union furnished evidence of
its parent company's preference for one credit union, that credit union should be allowed to describe its field of
membership to include the parent and all other companies under common control. One commenter stated that the components
of a field of membership definition should be limited to legal entities.
One commenter stated that the Chartering Manual does not state procedures necessary for a credit union to keep its
existing membership, if a company or a division has been sold. This commenter believes that if a company or division
is sold to a company which has a credit union, then the original credit union loses the field of membership after the
sale; otherwise, service should be allowed to continue.


2. NCUA Board Decision


The NCUA Board agrees that the wording of this portion of IRPS 89-1 pertaining to business relationships is in
need of some revision. The final IRPS has been rewritten to provide more clarity. However, the Board does not see a need
to broaden the occupational common bond definition in general at this time.
The Board does believe, however, that it is a disservice to cut off service to groups which are divested from a sponsoring
firm. The final IRPS permitted continued service if the group desires it.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, it is clear that some in the credit union community have misunderstood why the NCUA Board proposed requiring
listing of subsidiary entities included in a common bond. The agency is in the process of establishing a field of membership
database for internal monitoring of overlaps. Federal credit union listing of all subgroups would greatly enhance
the reliability and overall usefulness of the database. But the NCUA Board sees no need to impose this requirement
on a federal credit union which finds that process overly burdensome, and the final IRPS has deleted this portion of
the proposal. Such a credit union should understand, however, that if a specific group is not mentioned in its charter,
and the group in good faith states in a request for service from another credit union that it does not have credit union
service available (as often happens with new subsidiaries of sponsoring groups), an overlap may inadvertently be
permitted without full consideration for the overlapped credit union's interests. If the overlap is discovered
after the other credit union has begun service, it is likely that, in the interests of the group and the other credit
union, NCUA will permit the overlap to continue.



B. Associational Common Bonds



1. Comments



The proposal clarified that a federal credit union seeking to include an association in its field of membership may
only include natural persons who pay dues and have voting rights or hold office in the association. Eight commenters
supported this change. Twenty-one commenters opposed the proposal. In general, these commenters believed that
not all natural person associations require a member to pay dues. A few commenters stated that the proposal would harm
church associations that have members that do not pay dues. Four commenters stated the proposal would harm low-income
cooperatives. One commenter stated that the collection of dues for an associational group may be entirely irrelevant
to the group's purpose or mission. One commenter stated that this requirement can not be reasonably monitored by a
federal credit union.

The proposal also clarified that a federal credit union's field of membership has to be updated and approved by NCUA
when an association changed its bylaws to modify the scope of those eligible for membership. Six commenters approved
of this clarification. One commenter stated that without this limitation an associational credit union would be
allowed to change to an open field of membership. Thirteen commenters disapproved of the clarification. Six of these
commenters believed that if an association changed its bylaws frequently it could cause an administrative nightmare
for the credit union and NCUA if the charter had to be amended every time the bylaws changed. One commenter believed
the main concern should be whether the association in question was a viable functioning organization. This commenter
believed that an association with membership qualification requirements, bylaws and meetings should be defined
as a functioning organization.

The proposal removed the requirement that students must join the credit union prior to family members becoming eligible.
Five commenters agreed with this change.

One commenter stated that the final IRPS should be modified to allow for inclusion of an entire association in a federal
credit union at a higher level if that level provided broad based services which were not available at a lower level.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The NCUA Board agrees that the dues-paying and voting rights requirements of the proposal could be unfair to some bona
fide associations. The final IRPS lists these elements as factors to be considered, not as requirements.

The Board has also attempted to clarify in the final IRPS the ambiguities noted by some of the commenters.

The Board does not agree, however, that it should alter its present policy in favor of service to associations at the
lowest possible level, or that it is appropriate to allow associations to modify portions of their bylaws which dramatically
change the make-up of membership without agency review. The final IRPS maintains these provisions as in the proposal.




VI. Select Group Addition Issues

A. Comments



A number of comments were received on the various proposed changes to NCUA's select group addition policy. They are
best discussed as a group.



1. ``Public Interest'' Addition Comments



The Board requested comment on a limited ``public interest'' procedure by which NCUA might approve a federal credit
union expansion to include a group outside the operational area of a home or branch office, if such action was in the
interest of making quality credit union service available to all eligible groups who wish to have it, and if doing so
would not have a significant adverse effect on the safe and sound operations of credit unions. Any federal credit union
seeking such an expansion would need to provide certain documentation, including a summary of the views of each credit
union with a home or branch office within a 25 mile radius as to whether each has agreed to inclusion of the group in the
applying credit union's field of membership, and if the credit union refused, the reasons for the refusal.

Thirty commenters supported the concept of the ``public interest'' proposal. 

These commenters generally believed that the proposal would provide more people with credit union service. However,
most of these commenters believed the proposal's operational area requirement was unnecessary. Furthermore, sixteen
commenters stated that the proposal's documentation requirements were so onerous that it would discourage most
credit unions from trying to use the procedure. Six commenters opposed this proposal.

One commenter believed that the only use for the ``public interest'' procedure should be to provide an exception to
the rules for credit unions experiencing a loss of members due to some extraordinary circumstances, such as a base
closing or a corporate restructuring. This commenter believed the test for a ``public interest'' procedure should
be based on: (1) The demand for credit union service; (2) the capability of the credit union to provide services; and
(3) the level of membership necessary to sustain the affected credit union.



2. ``Operational Area'' Comments



NCUA has traditionally focused multiple group field of membership additions around the ``operational area'' of
a home or branch office. This policy was designed to ensure a satisfactory level of commitment and service to the groups
included in the field of membership, while also minimizing instances of overlap and deterring territorial stakeouts
by overly aggressive credit unions. However, in response to new technologies and innovations, the proposal clarified
operational area requirements. The first clarification was that for purposes of a field of membership expansion
the ``standard'' operational area will be considered an area within a 25 mile radius of a home or branch office, but
that this standard may be extended for rural areas. Six commenters believed the proposed operational area was reasonable
and approve of it. Four other commenters agreed in general with the definition but believed that there should be more
leeway for rural areas.

Forty-one commenters objected to the 25 mile operational area as outdated in light of current technology. Thirty-seven
commenters stated there should not be any operational area. They believed that direct deposit, automated teller
service, and service-by-phone, in many cases, has eliminated the need for physical access to a branch. Five commenters
believed operational area should just be one of many factors to be considered in a field of membership expansion.

A few of the commenters stated that a progressive approach to the expansion of services is one based on functionality,
not geography. They believed a functional approach should be based on the capacity and willingness to serve matched
with a demand for those services. One commenter suggested that the determination of the operational area of a credit
union should be based on whether the credit union can reasonably be expected to deliver adequate credit union service
to the area. This commenter suggested that NCUA approve a field of membership expansion request if: (1) There is a clear
demand for the credit union's services; (2) the credit union is capable of providing the services; and (3) other credit
unions in the area are not already providing the service. Twelve commenters stated that any credit union should have
the option to add select employee groups to its field of membership (without regard to operational area) if it has the
financial resources to do so and there is no overlap.



3. ``Shared Facilities'' Comments



The proposal stated that ``shared facilities'' and ``shared service centers'' were specifically to be excluded
from consideration as either a ``home'' or ``branch'' office for purposes of meeting NCUA's operational area requirement,
except in unusual circumstances_e.g., where a credit union is converting an existing home or branch office to a ``shared
facility.'' Nine commenters believed this to be a reasonable position and agreed with the clarification. One commenter
stated that this position would ultimately help service centers prosper and control predatory concerns from credit
unions not participating in shared service center programs.

Seven commenters opposed the clarification. Several commenters believed the proposal would force some credit unions
into unnecessary expenditures for ``brick and mortar'' facilities. Some commenters suggested that field of membership
expansions be allowed around a shared branch if the credit union has a material (20%) stake in the facility. They believed
shared branches were tantamount to a credit union's own property.



4. ``Branch'' Comments

The proposal stated that a facility which was directly and solely owned by, leased by or donated by a credit union and
had credit union employees regularly on site who accept payment on shares and disburse loans was clearly a home or branch
office. One commenter objected to the requirement that a branch office have a paid employee working in it. This commenter
believed this section needed to be modified to include credit union volunteers. 

One commenter believed that in order to facilitate growth among credit unions, NCUA should reconsider its position
that ``the addition of a new select group alone is not enough to justify a proposed home or branch office.'' 

One commenter believed the definition of branches should be expanded to more closely identify and define the difference
between an ``open branch'' and a ``closed branch.'' This commenter stated that an open branch should be identified
as one where members from any company or group could have free access and that a closed branch should be identified as
one that is located within a sponsor's facility that is accessible only to employees of that group. This commenter
believed that taking on additional small employee groups using a close branch as the base in determining the 25 mile
radius should not be permitted. 



B. NCUA Board Decision



The NCUA Board is not prepared to jettison the ``operational area'' limitation or to make substantial changes in how
that limitation is defined. The requirement has served credit unions well and remains vital. Some of the wording in
the final IRPS has been changed to make the concept more adaptable to the variety of credit union service outlets, however.
``Home or branch office'' has been changed to ``service facility,'' for example, and the requirement to have an ``employee''
on site has been changed to ``representative'' to accommodate the possibility of volunteers.

However, the final IRPS does not include provisions for a ``public interest'' field of membership expansion. Moreover,
the Board does not believe that technology has reached the point where access to a facility where business can be transacted
by interaction with another person is unimportant. Therefore, the operational area requirement will continue to
be linked to the credit union's ability to provide service by such means. Finally, the Board cannot, without substantially
more experience, allow ``shared service centers'' and other similar kinds of group service arrangements to be considered
``service facilities'' for select group expansion purposes; the effects of such a change are too unclear at this point.
The final IRPS therefore excludes from the definition of a ``shared facility'' locations at which service is provided
to a significant number of different credit unions' members.



VII. Community Charters 



A. Comments



Two commenters believed the proposal did not address the concerns of community credit unions. The proposal clarified
that a community credit union's operational (service) area was to be defined by its boundaries. Four commenters agreed
with this clarification. Four commenters believed that the authority to add new groups outside community boundaries
should be extended to all community charters where continued viability is threatened by a major corporate or military
restructuring. These commenters believed there was no reason to treat a ``converting to'' community charter any
differently from existing community charters when in both cases the threat is viability caused by similar events.
Eight commenters believed any community credit union should have the option to add select employee groups to its field
of membership if it has the financial ability to do so and NCUA determines that no other credit union in the area could
serve the group. Four commenters suggested allowing community credit unions to merge with multiple group or associational
credit unions while still continuing to serve the former fields of membership of both credit unions.

Four commenters believed NCUA should provide for the chartering of community credit unions in two non-adjacent communities.
These commenters believed the granting of community charter status in one area should not prevent the credit union
from continuing to serve and admit new members from existing select employee groups in a second area, or obtaining
a dual community charter. 

One commenter believed NCUA should make it easier to expand geographic boundaries of community credit unions by eliminating
the requirement of showing a ``commingling of the two communities.'' This commenter believed this requirement was
no longer realistic because electronic transactions have taken over in the marketplace.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The Board believes the final policy statement addresses the needs of community charters. In response to the advent
of new technologies in communication and the evolving character of communities, the Board has slightly revised the
definition of a community common bond. A community charter must continue to be limited to ``a well-defined neighborhood,
community, or rural district.'' However, a community will be defined as a single, well-defined area where residents
interact. To meet this definition, the Board has established the following common bond requirements for a community
charter: the geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and the applicant for a new charter or an expansion
must establish that the area is recognized as a ``distinct neighborhood, community or rural district.'' This new
policy eliminates the commingling requirement while still requiring the members to interact. The final policy also
clarifies that the community credit union's operational (service) area is defined by its boundaries.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00128 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As stated earlier, community credit unions may also apply for a designation as a ``distressed federal credit union''
and to do so regardless of whether they are converting to a community charter. These credit unions, as well as low-income
community credit unions, may add select employee groups outside their operational area to their fields of membership
as long as they have the financial ability to serve the group. After the credit union community has some experience
with this policy, the Board will assess the wisdom of extending this option to all community credit unions.



VIII. Overlap Issues



A. Comments



The proposal clarified that NCUA may exclude from overlap protection state chartered credit unions with a field of
membership so broadly defined as to include virtually everyone in a wide area. Four commenters agreed with this clarification.
However, many commenters addressed other overlap issues. Two commenters supported the requirement that credit
unions involved in overlap situations first attempt to resolve related issues among themselves before turning to
NCUA. Three commenters stated that field of membership policy was overly liberal and permits numerous overlaps which
hurt small credit unions. Eight commenters stated that overlaps between credit unions should be liberally permitted.

Four commenters believed NCUA should include a definition of the term ``incidental overlap'' as a further aid to the
credit union community. One commenter believed the term should be defined as 3% of the potential membership of the
credit union being overlapped. One commenter stated that overlaps are incidental if they do not create questions
of viability for the credit union affected by the overlap.

The proposal stated that an overlap may be justified if the original credit union failed to provide quality service
to the group. One commenter suggested that the Board define ``quality service'' and reexamine its position regarding
the absence of ``specialized service as not being a justification for an overlap.'' Seven other commenters also believed
that the term ``quality service'' needed to be defined. They believed the term was very subjective: Did it mean the
number of services, hours open, or the attitude of workers? A few of these commenters believed the lack of a definition
has hurt small credit unions.

One commenter supported NCUA's intent to provide overlap protection for any type of charter if there are significant
safety and soundness concerns. This commenter would expand this to include a low-income service impact test: A credit
union should be protected from overlaps which would impair its ability to effectively serve low-income members of
the community.

The proposal also stated that in special cases exclusionary language should be used to limit the membership eligibility
of widely dispersed employees or associations. One commenter disagreed with this limitation. This commenter believed
that if there was a legitimate common bond, such as a single employer or association, and no credit union was serving
the group, then exclusionary language was not necessary.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The final IRPS contains the provision in the proposal removing from overlap consideration broadly based state chartered
credit unions, which parallels how the agency approaches broadly based federal charters. As to most of the remaining
comments, the Board disagrees with many of the suggestions. The Agency's long-standing policy is working well. The
vast majority of all overlaps are consented to by the overlapped credit union. The remainder are resolved in a way which
makes the interests of the group paramount. The Board continues to believe it needs flexibility in this area. Therefore,
the final IRPS does not define ``incidental overlap'' or ``quality service.''

However, the Board agrees that experience with exclusionary clauses has not been entirely satisfactory. This entire
section has been rewritten in the final IRPS in the hope of limiting their use to the few situations where they are truly
warranted and effective.



IX. Documentation Issues



A. Comments



The proposal attempted to streamline documentation requirements. Five commenters stated that the documentation
requirements in the proposal were not burdensome. Ten commenters disagreed. Many of these commenters also believed
that financial statements were unnecessary in light of periodic call reports and examinations. Four commenters
believed that financial statements should not be necessary for field of membership expansions.

Two commenters noted that, for a field of membership expansion, the proposal required documentation from groups
``on the group's letterhead stationery and signed by an official representative to the group.'' The commenters believed
this has generally been interpreted to mean an officer of the employer. These commenters believed that NCUA should
be flexible and recognize that not all groups are represented by the employer or have an ``official'' representative.
They suggested that the IRPS allow the regions to accept other documentation or certification.



B. NCUA Board Decision



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00129 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NCUA Board agrees that in the vast majority of cases regional staff have sufficient financial information available
to make a determination as to the economic advisability of the proposed charter change. Therefore, the requirement
to submit financial statements with a charter change request has been deleted. If a regional office needs additional
information, it may ask for it. The NCUA Board also agrees that the requirement for letterhead stationery can be relaxed.
With regard to the requirement that an ``official representative'' of the group sign the letter requesting service,
the Board does not believe a change in the wording is needed, but will ensure that the regional offices are instructed
to be more flexible in applying the term to specific situations.



X. The Proposed ``File and Serve'' Procedure



A. Comments



The proposal requested comment on a ``File and Serve'' select group expansion procedure. It was envisioned that the
procedure would permit CAMEL code 1 and 2 credit unions to begin providing service to small groups_50 persons or fewer
was suggested_prior to formal NCUA approval of the expansion. Thirty-six commenters favored the procedure. These
commenters believed it would allow credit unions to timely serve new groups. However, some commenters suggested
an increase in the number of potential members that could be added using the procedure. One commenter inquired whether
the number included family members. Four commenters recommended NCUA issue guidelines on what to do if the expansion
is subsequently denied by the Region.

Eighteen commenters objected to the ``File and Serve'' proposal. The reasons were varied. Nine commenters stated
there were no procedures for what would happen if the expansion was denied by the Region and that it would be an administrative
nightmare if a denial occurred. Eight commenters believed this proposal was not justified since regulatory delay
in approving expansion requests was not a problem. Six commenters believed that there would be more conflicts arising
from both intentional and unintentional overlaps. Five commenters stated that regulatory approval distinguishes
credit unions from banks.

Three commenters suggested any CAMEL code 1, 2 and 3 credit unions be permitted to use the file and serve procedure.
One commenter suggested that NCUA implement an alternative procedure by which CAMEL code 1 and 2 credit unions should
be given preference by NCUA in reviewing field of membership expansions. Two commenters specifically objected to
the procedure's being tied to a CAMEL rating. Four commenters recommended that all credit unions should be able to
use the file and serve procedure. One of these commenters suggested NCUA could then restrict the file and serve authority
on a case-by-case basis for any credit union it had concerns about. One commenter recommended adding a requirement
that the filing credit union have to state that there was no overlap or existing eligibility for membership in another
credit union for the group to be served.



B. NCUA Board Decision



Many of the commenters' suggestions have been incorporated into the final IRPS. The new policy will permit well operated
federal credit unions in good standing with NCUA to apply for charter amendments which authorize the credit unions
to make use of a streamlined process for adding small occupational groups currently without credit union service.
The initial maximum number of persons in a group to be added under this procedure has been set initially by the NCUA Board
at 100. The Board may be resolution adjust that number from time to time as appropriate.



XI. Other Procedures for Reviewing Field of Membership Addition Requests



A. Comments



The proposal sought to clarify the mechanics of requesting additions to a federal credit union's field of membership.
Four commenters believed that the approval time on select employee group additions was excessive. Another commenter
stated that the field of membership expansion procedure was burdensome and should be streamlined. Two commenters
supported NCUA's goal of approving or denying field of membership expansion requests within the ``10 business day
or less'' time frame.

One commenter stated that, in regard to charter amendments, once NCUA approves one, the board of directors of the credit
union should not subsequently have to adopt it to make it effective.

Two commenters stated that pre-notification of a proposed field of membership expansion in another credit union's
operating area should be a common courtesy. Three commenters believed the final IRPS should provide at a minimum for
some form of publication and hearings or period of comment relative to an expansion of any credit union's field of membership.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The NCUA Board believes that a ten-business-day turnaround for field of membership amendment requests is reasonable.
All regions have automated the review process so that this time frame should be exceeded only in extraordinary cases.
The Board strongly believes, however, that a federal credit union's board needs to be involved in the process_after
all, the board is responsible for the institution's overall direction and control. There are adequate procedures
a federal credit union can put in place to ensure that needed board oversight can be maintained without delaying initiation
of service to a group.

<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>

The Board also disagrees that a public notice procedure should be implemented. The overlap procedures now in place
provide adequate safeguards.



XII. Federalism Concerns



A. Comments



The proposal would permit state-chartered credit unions that are converting to a federal charter and that had an established
history of being able to serve multiple groups outside of its operational area to continue to serve these groups without
regard to the operational area requirements normally applicable to new federal multiple group charters. Three commenters
supported the change but suggested that the concept of operational area be discarded in favor of non-geographic criteria.
One commenter opposed relaxing the rules for converting state charters.



B. NCUA Board Decision



The Board believes that, with respect to converting state charters, where the commitment to the group and the ability
to provide quality service have been demonstrated, there is no need to impose the operational area requirement. The
final IRPS maintains this portion of the proposal. Moreover, the IRPS establishes the same flexibility for an occupational,
associational, and multiple group federal credit union converting to a community charter.



XIII. Miscellaneous Matters



A. Staff Leasing



1. Comments



The proposal attempted to clarify NCUA's policy on staff leasing arrangements. The proposal stated that where the
requirements of existing policy were met, the employees leased to a firm listed in a federal credit union's field of
membership might be added as a common bond expansion. Where those requirements were not met, the elements of a select
group expansion to serve employees of the leasing company had to be met. When a leasing company was to be included in
a credit union's field of membership, the company had to identify each client and work location served by the leasing
company.

Four commenters favored the leasing clarification. Five commenters disapproved of the clarification. These commenters
believed that the requirement for specific delineation of each separate company that was a client of the employee
leasing firm was both impractical and impossible from an operational standpoint.



2. NCUA Board Decision



On reconsideration, it is evident that general policy can be adequately adapted to the leasing company situation.
Therefore, this portion has been deleted from the final IRPS.



B. Spin-offs, Mergers, and Purchase and Assumptions 



1. Comments



The proposal clarified NCUA's policy on mergers, spin-offs and purchase and assumptions. Four commenters approved
of the update on spin-offs. Three of these commenters specifically approved of the voting requirements for a spin-off.
Seven commenters approved of the revised merger section. Three commenters approved of the provision to allow a merged
state credit union's field of membership to be served by the continuing federal credit union even if the inclusion
of this field of membership would otherwise be restricted under NCUA guidelines.

One commenter disapproved of the merger policy. This commenter believed that by applying an operational area condition
to distress mergers, NCUA is limiting its own range of action. This commenter further stated that a suitable merger
candidate may not be located within the operational area of a distressed credit union and that it seemed wasteful to
wait for emergency conditions to evolve and moot the operational area issue.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00131 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One commenter suggested that NCUA should be able to put a credit union for which it is seeking a merger partner into temporary
conservatorship, which would allow public notification and bidding from interested credit unions. In addition,
this commenter stated that current merger procedures were left to the discretion of each regional office and suggested
NCUA give serious consideration to standardizing procedures which would give all credit unions an opportunity to
bid. 

Four commenters suggested allowing community credit unions to merge with occupational, associational, or multiple
group credit unions while still continuing to serve the former fields of membership of both credit unions. Two commenters
requested that with respect to mergers, the final IRPS should clarify that when a state chartered credit union is merged
into a federal credit union, the federal credit union would be allowed to retain the merged state chartered credit
union's select employee groups, regardless of operational area, in order to assure the vitality of the federal credit
union after the merger. Another commenter agreed with this suggestion and would expand it to all mergers, including
mergers between federal credit unions. 



2. NCUA Board Decision 



The NCUA Board agrees that operational area limitations should not be an obstacle to merger of credit unions in distress
situations, and believes this was Congress' intent in giving NCUA emergency merger authority. The Board has therefore
interpreted Section 205(h) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1785(h)) to permit authorizing as emergency
mergers what have become known since IRPS 89-1 as distress mergers. 

For the reasons stated earlier, however, the Board does not believe that the operational area limitation should be
discarded entirely or that exercise of NCUA's conservatorship authority should become a standard part of the merger
process.



C. Removal of Groups 


1. Comments 



The proposal clarified NCUA's policy on the removal of groups from a federal credit union's field of membership. Four
commenters agreed with the clarification. One of these commenters suggested allowing the removal of a group when
it does not respond to a federal credit union's repeated attempts to contact them. 



2. NCUA Board Decision 



The final IRPS incorporates this suggested change. 



 D. School Systems 


1. Comments 



The proposal clarified that employees of different school systems and different government units do not have the
same primary sponsor. Therefore, the addition of the employees of a particular school district by a federal credit
union serving employees of an adjoining school district would have to be done under the select group addition procedures.
Three commenters concurred with this clarification. Two commenters disagreed with this proposal. They believed
that school employees in different school districts may share the same common bond and they should be added under the
common bond procedure. 



2. NCUA Board Decision 



The final IRPS deletes discussion of school systems. They will be analyzed under general common bond policy. In the
vast majority of cases, different school systems will be considered different common bonds. 





E. Industrial Parks 


1. Comments 



The proposal suggested modifying existing policy to permit field of membership expansions to include all employees
of office complexes, industrial parks, shopping centers and similar establishments upon request from the leasing
agent or similar authoritative figure. No overlap protection would be given to the expanding credit union and exclusionary
clauses would be used to prevent injury to those credit unions serving a portion of these employees. Sixteen commenters
favored this proposal. One commenter believed NCUA needs to identify other contacts beside the leasing agent. 

Three commenters opposed this modification. One commenter stated that if NCUA adopted this modification, it should
ensure that no overlap protection was given to the expanding credit union and that exclusionary language was incorporated
into the bylaws of the expanding credit union to prevent possible injury to other credit unions which served the same
employees. One commenter stated that this modification would cause numerous overlaps in fields of memberships.




2. NCUA Board Decision



The Board has decided to adopt this proposal with a modification. Although the proposal stated that exclusionary
clauses would be used to protect overlapped credit unions, the Board believes that the member, in such cases, should
have the ability to use the credit union which best serves his/her needs. In many cases it might be the industrial park
type credit union that is more attractive to the individual. Therefore, in general, no overlap protection will be
given to the credit union with the industrial park or similar complex in its charter. However, the regional director
may, for safety and soundness reasons, provide overlap protection or require exclusionary clauses to prevent significant
economic injury to other credit unions serving a portion of these employees. 

Although NCUA has not specifically identified parties other than the complex leasing agent or owner, the final IRPS
provides sufficient flexibility in this matter.



F. Outside Vendors



1. Comments



The proposal provided guidance on the safety and soundness concerns NCUA had with a credit union using outside parties,
insurance agents and car dealers, among others, to recommend select group expansions. Three commenters approved
of this addition. One commenter stated that this guidance should be expanded to include discussion of indirect lending.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The final IRPS includes the discussion on outside vendors and has been expanded to include indirect lending.

G. Approval of Officials



1. Comments



The proposal clarified that NCUA must approve all prospective officials and management personnel of a newly chartered
credit union during the first two years. A few comments opposed this provision.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The Board has adopted the proposal in the final IRPS since the requirement is statutory; the reason for its inclusion
in the IRPS is to be a reminder to credit union officials.



H. Appeal Rights



1. Comments



The proposal clarified the appeal rights for new charters and for those credit unions denied requests for a field of
membership amendment, spin-offs and mergers. Eight commenters supported the appeal procedure. Nine commenters
believed the appeal procedure was insufficient. Four of these commenters requested that appeals be sent directly
to the central office and bypass the region. One commenter questioned whether central office staff would act independently
of the regional director. One commenter stated the proposal was unclear on what rights of appeal an overlapped credit
union had involving the field of membership of another credit union.

The appeal process in the proposal did not include a provision for oral argument. Six commenters agreed that oral argument
before the Board was unnecessary. Fourteen commenters disagreed.

One commenter suggested the proposal clarify that a resubmission or additional information for consideration to
the Regional Director within 90 days of a denial should be considered a new request for purposes of the appeal time limit.
Furthermore, the commenter stated, if the resubmission was denied, the credit union should then have another 60 days
to appeal.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The Board is currently undertaking a complete review of its appeal process. The final IRPS makes the agency's standard
appeal process applicable.



I. Professional Organizations



1. Comments



The proposal included language to minimize potential conflicts of interest when adding certain professional organizations
to the field of membership of a federal credit union. Four commenters concurred with the guidance provided when adding
a professional organization to a field of membership.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The final IRPS includes this portion of the proposal.



J. Corporate Federal Credit Unions



1. Comments



The proposal clarified that corporate credit union chartering and field of membership issues were handled by the
Office of Examination and Insurance. Four commenters agreed with the proposed change.



2. NCUA Board Decision



The final IRPS includes this portion of the proposal.



K. Appendix C_Type of Membership Classification System



1. Comments



One commenter stated the classification was fixed at the time of chartering and it was his understanding that it never
changed. Furthermore, in recognition that the membership composition of a credit union can undergo substantial
change over time, this commenter suggested a procedure be created to provide classification changes. Otherwise,
this commenter believed classification related data would become increasingly flawed.



2. NCUA Board Decision



Since the coding is used for internal analytical purposes, Appendix C has been deleted from the final IRPS. As a note,
the codes are changed periodically by NCUA staff.



L. Format of the Manual



1. Comments



One commenter was concerned with the terminology ``field of membership expansion.'' This commenter believed that
all changes in the field of membership were not for the purpose of expansion and some field of membership ``modifications''
were based on considerations other than the mere decision of a credit union to expand. This commenter recommended
replacing the term ``expansion'' with ``modification.'' Two commenters believed the manual should be reorganized
so it would be more accessible to the user.

The Board agrees that not all field of membership changes are expansions and therefore has replaced the term ``expansion''
with the term ``amendment.'' The format of the proposed IRPS has been modified substantially in the final version.
Additionally, the IRPS, when put in the form of a manual, will be indexed to make it easier to use.



Regulatory Procedures



Regulatory Flexibility Act



As was noted in the proposed IRPS, the NCUA Board has determined that changes to NCUA policy resulting from adoption
of the IRPS will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those
under $1 million in assets). The changes in the final IRPS clarify existing policy rather than create new restrictions.
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been performed.



Paperwork Reduction Act



Paperwork requirement should decrease under the final IRPS. The information collection requirements contained
in the IRPS have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. OMB is in the process of reviewing
these requirements. A notice of OMB approval will be published in the 

Federal Register

 upon its receipt. Any comments regarding collection requirement should be forwarded directly to the OMB Desk Officer
indicated below at the following address: OMB Reports Management Branch, New Executive Office Building, room 3208,
Washington, DC 20503; Attn.: Gary Waxman.



Executive Order



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The final IRPS makes
no significant changes with respect to state credit unions and, therefore, will not materially affect state interests.

CHAPTER 1_FEDERAL CREDIT UNION CHARTERING


I_Goals of NCUA Chartering Policy


NCUA's chartering policies are directed toward achieving three goals:
 to uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act concerning granting federal charters
 to promote credit union safety and soundness
 to make quality credit union service available to all eligible groups who wish to have it.
NCUA may grant a charter to any group or combination of groups desiring credit union service where it finds:
 the group or groups possess an appropriate common bond;
 the subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent the group; and
 establishment of the credit union is economically advisable_i.e., it will be a viable institution and its
chartering will not materially affect the interests of other credit unions or the credit union system.
Generally, these are the only criteria NCUA will look to. In unusual circumstances, however, NCUA may consider other
factors, such as other federal law or public policy, in deciding if a charter should be approved.


II_Common Bond


Congress, in the Federal Credit Union Act, has recognized three types of federal credit union common bonds_occupational,
associational, and community. A federal credit union may also consist of a combination of occupational, associational,
and, in certain limited circumstances, community groups. For example, NCUA may charter a federal credit union consisting
of employees of a local school district and members of a church group.
The Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA recognize that individual groups have their own common bond. All of the groups
belonging to one particular credit union included in Section 5 of the credit union's charter make up the credit union's
field of membership. If the charter is granted, the federal credit union will only be able to grant loans and provide
services to persons within the groups defined in the field of membership.
If a federal credit union later wishes to add persons to its field of membership, it must comply with the procedures
set forth in Chapter 2.


II.A_Occupational Common Bonds


II.A.1_General


A federal credit union may include in a single occupational common bond, regardless of location, any and all persons
who share that common bond. NCUA permits a person's membership in an occupational common bond to be established in
a number of ways:
 Employment (or a long-term contractual relationship equivalent to employment) in a single corporation or
other legal entity makes that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the entity.
 Employment in a corporation or other legal entity with an ownership interest in or by another legal entity makes
that person part of an occupational common bond of employees of the two entities.
 Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company
under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with another company) makes that person part of an
occupational common bond of employees of the two entities.
A proposed federal credit union must supply documentation from as many authorized representatives as are needed
to establish that all persons to be included in a single occupational common bond are in fact linked in one of the ways
described above.
An occupational common bond must include a geographic definitions, e.g., ``employees, officials, and persons who
work regularly under contract in Miami, Florida for ABC Corporation or any of these majority-owned subsidiaries.
* * *'' Other acceptable geographic definitions are: ``employees of * * * who are paid
from * * *'' or ``employees of * * * who are supervised from * * *'' To
the maximum extent possible, setting geographic definitions by changeable corporate or division boundary_e.g.,
``employees of Federal Reserve District 6''_is to be avoided.
So that NCUA may monitor any potential field of membership overlaps, each group to be served (e.g., employees of subsidiaries,
franchisees, and contractors) may be separately listed.
The employer may also be included in this common bond_e.g., ``ABC Corporation and its subsidiaries.'' The employer
group will be defined in the last clause describing the field of membership.


II.A.2_Sample Occupational Fields of Membership


Some examples of occupational group definitions are:
 ``Employees of the Scott Manufacturing Company who work in Chester, Pennsylvania. * * *''
(common bond_same employer)
 ``Employees and elected and appointed officials of municipal government in Parma, Ohio. * * *''
(common bond_same employer)
 ``Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority-owned subsidiary, Johnson Toothpaste Company, who
work in Augusta and Portland, Maine. * * *'' (common bond_parent and majority-owned subsidiary company)
 ``Personnel of fleet units of the U.S. Navy home ported at Mayport, Florida. * * *'' (common
bond_same employer)
 ``Department of Defense civilian and U.S. Army personnel who work or are stationed at, or are attached or assigned
to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, or those who are retired from, or their dependents or dependent survivors who are eligible
by law or regulation to receive and are receiving benefits or services from, that military installation. * * *''
(common bond_same employer)
 ``Employees of those contractors who work regularly at U.S. Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. * * *''
(common bond_employees of contractors)
 ``Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursing students who work at Boston Medical
Center at the locations stated: * * *'' (common bond_same employer)

 ``Employees and teachers who work for the School District Number 3 in Austin, Texas * * *.''

 ``Employees of the JKL Employee Leasing Company who are paid from Lake Charles, Louisiana * * *.''
(common bond_same employer)
 ``Employees of JKL, Inc. and STU, Inc. working for the XYZ Joint Venture Company in Los Gatos, California * * *.''
Some examples of insufficiently defined occupational groups are:
 ``Employees of engineering firms in Seattle, Washington.'' (Not the same occupational common bond, since
various firms compete against one another; names of firms must be stated; however, may be the basis for a multiple group
charter.)
 ``Persons employed or working in Chicago, Illinois.'' (No common bond; names of firms must be stated.)
 ``Persons working in the entertainment industry in California.'' (No occupational common bond, since firms
compete against one another; names of firms must be stated.)


II.B_Associational Common Bonds


II.B.1_General


A federal credit union may include in its field of membership, regardless of location, all members of a recognized
association.
NCUA limits this common bond to groups consisting primarily of individuals (natural persons) who participate in
activities developing common loyalties, mutual benefits, and mutual interests. Except for student, church, and
similar groups, all associational common bonds will include a definition of the group that may be served based on the
effective date of the association's charter and bylaws and a geographic limitation. Therefore, with the exceptions
noted above, applicants for an associationally-based federal credit union charter must provide a copy of the association's
charter and bylaws.
Qualifying associational groups must hold meetings open to all natural person members at least once a year, must sponsor
other activities which clearly demonstrate that the members of the group meet and interact regularly to accomplish
the objectives of the association, and must have an authoritative definition of who is eligible for membership_usually,
this will be the association's charter and bylaws.
In determining whether a group satisfies the common bond requirement for a federal credit union charter, NCUA will
consider the totality of the circumstances_such as whether members pay dues, have voting rights, and hold office,
whether the group maintains a membership list, the clarity of the associational group's definition and compactness
of its membership, and the frequency of meetings and the interaction of members. A support group, whose members are
continually changing, may not meet the criteria.
NCUA's focus with respect to chartering associational federal credit unions will be on the group's natural person
members. In certain instances, however, NCUA will also allow non-natural persons (e.g., corporate sponsors, entities
participating in programs to alleviate poverty and distress, or organizations of members) to be eligible for membership.
It is not necessary that every non-natural person member of the group be a recognized legal entity; NCUA will consider
such groups on a case-by-case basis.
Student groups_for example, parent-teacher organizations, alumni associations, and students in a trade school
or other curriculum_and church groups constitute associational common bonds and may qualify for a federal credit
union charter. Since such groups usually do not have a formal association charter, there is no requirement for these
groups to provide a charter or bylaws.
Homeowners associations, tenant groups, electric co-ops, consumer groups and other groups of persons having an
``interest in'' a particular cause and certain consumer cooperatives may be eligible to receive a federal charter.
However, they must make a strong showing of common activities which clearly demonstrate that the group meets and interacts
regularly to accomplish the objectives of the association. Furthermore, they must provide clear evidence of economic
viability.
Newly-organized associations must make a similar strong showing of common activities. Experience has shown that
a new group's efforts are best focused on solidifying member interest before attempting to offer credit union service.

<TEXT>
 

The associational sponsor itself may also be included in the field of membership_e.g., ``ABC Association''_and
will be shown in the last clause of the field of membership.


II.B.2_Subsequent Changes to Association's Bylaws


If the association's membership or geographical definitions in its charter and bylaws are changed subsequent to
the effective state dated in the field of membership, the credit union must submit the revised charter or bylaws for
NCUA's consideration prior to serving members of the association added as a result of the change. This type of field
of membership amendment will require following select group amendment procedures discussed in Chapter 2.


II.B.3_Widely Dispersed Associational Charters 


NCUA policy is to charter associational federal credit unions at the lowest organizational level which is economically
feasible. NCUA will grant associational charters with widely dispersed memberships only where clearly demonstrated
to be in the best interests of the association's members and the credit union community, and only after scrutinizing
the adequacy of the applicant's common bond and the economic advisability of a more compact field of membership. NCUA,
in its discretion, may require that the proposed field of membership be narrowed before granting a new charter. Amendment
to include a larger portion of the association's members may be allowed at a later time, if appropriate.
Also, as with any widely dispersed group, overlap issues are likely to arise, either at the time of or subsequent to
chartering. NCUA will consider the effect that granting a charter with such a group in its field of membership would
have on any number of existing credit unions. In addition, an associational credit union with a widely dispersed membership
may expect overlaps, particularly at the local level, to be granted to other credit unions in the future.
In recognition of these unique circumstances, NCUA follows a separate internal procedure for associational charter
applications for associations with proposed fields of membership of 500 or more persons which cross NCUA regional
boundaries. NCUA's Director of Examination and Insurance and all NCUA regional directors with any of the association's
members located in their region must vote on the charter application. A majority vote is required for approvals. Tie
votes are referred directly to the NCUA Board for decision.


II.B.4_Limits of Associational Common Bond 


Except for retiree clubs and low-income groups (discussed below), associations formed primarily to obtain a federal
credit union charter do not have a sufficient associational common bond. Similarly, associations based on a client-customer
relationship_for example, an insurance company and its customers or a buyer's club and its members_do not have a sufficient
associational common bond.
The common bond extends only to the association's members. The employees of a member of a local chamber of commerce,
for example, do not have a sufficiently close tie to the association to be included. A proposal to include these persons
among those to be served by the federal credit union may be considered as a multiple-group charter application. In
such cases, letters of support and request for service must be provided from each separate entity.


II.B.5_Sample Associational Fields of Membership


Some examples of associational group definitions are:
 Regular members of Locals 10 and 13, IBEW, Miami, Florida, who qualify for membership in accordance with their
charter and bylaws in effect on May 20, 1994.''
 ``Members of the Hoosier Farm Bureau who live or work in Grant, Logan, or Lee Counties of Indiana, who qualify
for membership in accordance with its charter and bylaws in effect on March 7, 1994.''
 ``Members of the First Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas.''
 ``Members of the Shalom Congregation in Chevy Chase, Maryland.''
 ``Regular members of the Corporate Executives Association, located in Westchester, New York, who live or
work in Westchester, Rockland, and Suffolk Counties in New York, who qualify for membership in accordance with its
charter and bylaws in effect on December 1, 1994.''
 ``Members of the Northern Michigan Electric Co-op located in Marquette, Michigan.''
 ``Members of the ABC Association living or working in New York, New York, who qualify for membership in accordance
with its charter and bylaws in effect on January 21, 1994.'' Some examples of insufficiently defined associational
group definitions are:
 ``Members of military service clubs in the State of New Mexico.'' (No single associational tie; specific clubs
and locations must be named; may be considered as multiple group.)
 ``Veterans of U.S. military service.'' (Group is too broadly defined; no formal association of all members
of the group.)
Some examples of unacceptable associational common bonds are:
 ``Members of ABC Buyers Club.'' (An interest in purchasing does not meet associational standards.)
 ``Customers of ABC Insurance Company.'' (Policyholders or customer/client relationships do not meet associational
standards.)


II.C_Community Common Bonds


II.C.1_General


Congress requires that a credit union charter based on a tie to a specific geographic location be limited to ``a well-defined
neighborhood, community, or rural district.'' NCUA policy is to limit the community to a single, geographically
well-defined area where residents interact.
NCUA recognizes three types of affinity on which a community common bond can be based_persons who live in, persons
who worship in, and persons who work in the community. Businesses and other legal entities within the community boundaries
may also qualify for membership. Given the diversity of community characteristics throughout the country and NCUA's
goal of making credit union service available to all eligible groups who wish to have it, NCUA has established the following
common bond requirements for community charters:
 The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and
 The charter applicant must establish that the area is recognized as a distinct ``neighborhood, community,
or rural district.''

II.C.2_Special Documentation Requirements


Information to support that the area chosen represents one well-defined area, distinguishable from the immediate
surrounding areas, includes:
 political jurisdictions
 major trade areas (shopping patterns)
 traffic flows
 shared/common facilities (for example, educational, medical, police and fire protection, school district,
water, etc.)
 organizations/clubs whose membership is made up exclusively of persons within the area
 newspapers or other periodicals published for and about the area
 census tracts
 common characteristics and background of residents (for example, income, religious beliefs, primary ethnic
groups, similarity of occupations, household types, primary age group, etc.)
 history of area
 in general, what distinguishes the chosen area and its residents to be distinguishable from the immediate
surrounding areas and residents_some examples are old, well established ethnic neighborhoods, planned communities
and small/rural towns
The following information must be provided to support a need for a community credit union:
 a list of credit unions presently in area
 a list of other financial institutions (for example, banks, savings and loan associations) that service the
area
Necessary written documentation (for example, letters, surveys, studies, pledges, petitions) reflecting support
for the application for or the conversion to a community credit union is as follows:
 For the residents of the area:
 Approximate number contacted.
 Number in favor of the credit union.
 Number against the credit union.
 Number who will join the credit union.
 Number who have pledged initial and/or systematic savings and amount of pledges.
 For the employers:
 Number of area employers and number of employees.
 Number contacted.
 Number in favor of the credit union.
 Number against the credit union.
 Number willing to provide payroll deductions to the credit union.
 Number willing to provide other type(s) of support to the credit union.
 For organizations (including churches):
 Number in areas and number of members.
 Number contacted.
 Number in favor of the credit union.
 Number against the credit union.
 Number willing to provide some type of support to the credit union, i.e., advertising facilities, etc.
 letters of support from area civic leaders.
If the community is also a recognized legal entity, it may comprise or be included in the field of membership_for example,
``DEF Township, Kansas'' or ``GHI County, Minnesota.''


II.C.3_Community Service Area


The service area of a community federal credit union is the area defined in its charter, usually with north, east, south,
and west boundaries.


II.C.4_Sample Community Fields of Membership 


Some examples of community common bond definitions are:
 ``Persons who live or work in, and businesses located in the area of XYZ City bounded by Fern Street on the north,
Long Street on the east, Fourth Street on the south, and Elm Avenue on the west.''
 ``Persons who live or work in Green County, Maine. . . .''
 ``Persons who live, worship or work in and businesses and other legal entities located in Independent School
District No. 1, DuPage County, Illinois. . . .''
 ``Persons who live or work within a twenty mile radius of the main post office in Walnut, Illinois. . . .''
(Rural areas only.)
Some examples of insufficiently defined community common bond definitions are:
 ``Persons who live or work within and businesses located within a ten-mile radius of Washington, DC.'' (Not
a recognized neighborhood, community, or rural district.)
 ``Persons who live or work in the industrial section of New York, New York.'' (Not a recognized neighborhood,
community, or rural district.)


II.D_Multiple Occupational/Associational Common Bonds


II.D.1_General


NCUA may charter a federal credit union to serve a combination of distinct, definable occupational and/or associational
common bonds. For a common bond which will constitute a majority of the federal credit union's field of membership,
the requirements for occupational and associational fields of membership apply. Any other group constituting an
occupational or associational common bond to be included within the federal credit union's field of membership must
be within what will be the credit union's operational area.
A proposed federal credit union's operational area is the area which, as determined by NCUA in its sole discretion,
may reasonably be served by the service facilities that will be accessible by the groups to be included in the field
of membership when the credit union begins operation. A credit union's service facility is a place where, also as determined
by NCUA in its sole discretion: (1) Shares are accepted for members' accounts; (2) loan applications are accepted
or loans are disbursed; (3) a member can deal directly with a credit union representative; and (4) the service provided
is clearly associated with that particular credit union. An automated teller machine or similar device is not a federal
credit union service facility. Similarly, a branch or service center shared by a number of credit unions is not a service
facility for purposes of this Chapter.
Any members of a group who will have access to one of a proposed federal credit union's service facilities may be included
in the field of membership. In addition, the group as a whole will be considered to be within a proposed credit union's
operational area when:
 A majority of the group's members live, work, or gather regularly within the operational area;
 The group's headquarters is located within the operational area; or
 The group's ``paid from'' or ``supervised from'' location is within the operational area.
The following special additional requirements pertaining to multiple group applications must be satisfied before
NCUA will grant such a charter:
 Each group to be included in the proposed field of membership of the federal credit union must have its own occupational
or associational common bond.
 Except for employee groups in the same industrial park, shopping center or similar facility, each group must
individually request inclusion in the proposed federal credit union's charter.
 The proposed federal credit union's business plan must show that the credit union will possess the financial
resources and management capability to provide quality credit union service to each group.
 The proposed federal credit union must show that, when it begins operations, each group to be added will be within
the operational area of a service facility to which the group will have access.


II.D.2_Sample Multiple Group Field of Membership


An example of a multiple group field of membership is: ``The field of membership of this federal credit union shall
be limited to the following:
1. Employees of Dupont Corporation who work in Wilmington, Delaware;

<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00138 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Partners and employees of Smith & Jones, Attorney at Law, who work in Wilmington, Delaware;

3. Members of the GHI Association who live in Wilmington, Delaware, and qualify for membership in accordance with
its charter and bylaws in effect on December 31, 1994.



II.D.3_Additional Documentation



For multiple group charters, NCUA will need the following, in addition to what is required for new charters generally:

 For each group seeking to be included in the proposed federal credit union's field of membership, the credit
union must provide a letter from the group, on the group's letterhead stationery and signed by an official representative
of the group wherever possible, or if that is not possible, such other documentation or certification as the regional
director may, in his or her discretion, deem appropriate, containing this information:

 The fact that the group wants to obtain service from the proposed federal credit union, the kind of service it
desires and the credit union has agreed to provide, and the extent to which the group supports the credit union_e.g.,
by providing access to its employees or members via payroll deduction, by permitting use of employee or members' newsletter,
etc.

 The number of employees or members in the group.

 The proximity to the proposed federal credit union's closest service facility.

 The name of any credit union to which the group currently has access.

 The group's headquarters location and all other work locations the credit union is proposing to serve.

 If the group is eligible for membership in another credit union, documentation must be provided to support
inclusion of the group under the standards set forth in the ``Overlaps'' section of this chapter.



II.E_Other Persons Sharing Common Bond



A number of persons by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group may be included, at the charter applicant's
option, in the field of membership. These include the following:

 ``Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union.''

 ``Employees of this credit union.''

 ``Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment.''

 Members of their immediate families.''

 ``Volunteers.''

 ``Organizations of such persons.''

``Members of their immediate families'' may be generally defined as deemed appropriate by a federal credit union
when including this group among those to be served. To be made effective, however, the federal credit union's board
of directors must approve the definition by resolution, and include it in Article XVIII, Section 2, of its by-laws.
NCUA approval is not necessary.

Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers
working at a hospital or church.

Under Article II, Section 5, of NCUA's Standard Bylaws, if a member leaves the field of membership, standard member
services are terminated. However, the board of directors may, by resolution, set forth the circumstances under which
a member may maintain membership. This option is commonly referred to as the ``once a member, always a member'' bylaw
provision. NCUA approval is not necessary here, either.



III_Subscribers



Federal credit unions are organized by persons who donate time and resources and are responsible for determining
the interest, commitment, and advisability of forming a federal credit union. The organization of federal credit
union takes considerable planning and dedication in order to ensure the success of the new credit union.

Persons interested in organizing a federal credit union should contact the NCUA regional office serving the state
in which the credit union will be organized or one of the trade associations. Lists of NCUA offices and trade associations
are shown in the appendices. NCUA will provide information to groups interested in pursuing a federal charter and
will assist them in contacting an organizer.

A credit union organizer may be a trade association representative or a person with training and experience in chartering
new federal credit unions. The functions of the organizer are to provide direction, guidance, and advice on the chartering
process. The organizer also provides the group with information about a credit union's functions and purpose as well
as technical assistance in preparing and submitting the charter application. Close communication and cooperation
between the organizer and the group members are critical to the chartering process.

The Federal Credit Union Act requires that seven or more natural persons_the ``subscribers''_must present to NCUA
for approval a sworn organization certificate stating at a minimum:

 The name of the proposed federal credit union.

 The location of the proposed federal credit union and the territory in which it will operate.

 The names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and the number of shares subscribed by each.

 The initial par value of the shares.

 The detailed proposed field of membership.

 The term of the existence of the corporation, which may be perpetual.

 The fact that the certificate is made to enable such persons to avail themselves of the advantages of the Federal
Credit Union Act.

False statements on the organization certificate may be grounds for federal criminal prosecution.



IV_Economic Advisability



IV.A_Viability



IV.A.1_General



Before chartering a federal credit union, NCUA must be assured that the institution will be viable and that it will
not materially affect existing state or federal credit unions. This economic advisability inquiry has become especially
important since 1970, when Congress assigned NCUA the obligation to establish a fund insuring credit union members'
shares and to preserve that fund.

NCUA will conduct an independent on-site investigation of each charter application to assure itself that the proposed
credit union can be successful. In general, the success of any credit union depends on: (a) the depth of the members'
support; (b) the character and fitness of management; and (c) present and projected market conditions.



IV.A.2_Proposed Management's Character and Fitness



The Federal Credit Union Act requires NCUA to satisfy itself as to the ``general character and fitness'' of the subscribers.
In addition, prospective officials and employees will be the subject of credit and background investigations. The
investigation reports must demonstrate their ability to effectively handle financial matters.

NCUA also needs assurance that the management team will have the requisite skills_particularly in leadership and
accounting_and the commitment to dedicate the time and effort needed to make the proposed federal credit union a success.



IV.A.3_Member Support



While NCUA has not set a minimum size field of membership for chartering a federal credit union, experience has shown
that a credit union with under 500 potential members generally is unlikely to succeed. Therefore, a charter applicant
with a proposed field of membership of under 500 will have to demonstrate convincing support for the credit union.
For example, a small occupational group must demonstrate a commitment for significant long-term support from the
employer.

The group's size is meaningful only if members participate in the credit union. The charter applicant must show that
a substantial percentage of the group's members will join the credit union and use its services. Survey results must
be based, at a minimum, on a sampling of 250 potential members. In particular instances, especially where the common
bond is broadly defined or newly established, NCUA may require a larger sampling.

<TEXT>
 

IV.A.4.a_General 



The ability to compete in the marketplace and to adapt to changing market conditions is key to the survival of any enterprise,
and a crucial part of that is the ability to plan well. NCUA, therefore, requires an applicant to submit a business plan
based on realistic and supportable projections and assumptions, including, as a minimum, these elements: 

 Mission statement. 

 Analysis of market conditions_economic prospects for the group, availability of financial services from
other credit unions, banks, and savings and loans. 

 Summary of survey results. 

 Financial services needed/desired. 

 Financial services to be provided. 

 How/when services are to be implemented. 

 Staffing of credit union and credentials of key employees. 

 Physical facility_office, equipment. 

 Type of recordkeeping system, including consideration of a data processing system. 

 Budget for 1st and 2nd year. 

 Semiannual pro forma financial statements for 1st and 2nd year, including assumptions_e.g., loan and dividend
rates. 

 Goals for number of members. 

 Goals for operating independently. 

 Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation. 

 Written policies (shares, lending, investments, funds management, capital accumulation, dividends).


 Goals for shares and loans. 

 Plan for continuity_directors, committee members. 

 Evidence of sponsor commitment if subsidies are critical to success of the federal credit union_evidence
may be in the form of letters, contracts, or any other such document on which the proposed federal credit union can substantiate
its projects. 

NCUA expects that the subscribers and proposed officials will understand and support the business plan submitted.




IV.A.4.b_Special Requirements for Community Credit Unions 



Community credit unions are frequently more susceptible to competition from other local financial institutions
and generally do not have substantial support from any single sponsoring company or association. Also, the lack of
payroll deduction creates special challenges in the development of savings promotion programs and in the collection
of loans. Therefore, it is essential for the group to develop a detailed and practical business plan for at least the
first three years of operation. The business plan should contain, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:


 Analysis of market area_geographic, demographic, employment, income, housing, and economic data. 

 Service/market strategy_financial and other services to be provided, new member/share/loan promotion
policies and procedures and income generation strategy. 

 Organizational/management plan_qualification and planned training of officials/employees, operating
facilities to include office space/equipment and supplies, accounting system, safeguarding of assets, insurance
coverage, etc. 

 Financial plan_sources and application of funds statements and pro forma balance sheet and income/expense
statements and assumptions. 



IV.B_Effects on Other Credit Unions_Overlaps 



(This discussion pertains to new and existing charters.) 



IV.B.1_Overlaps In General 



An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions, including state charters.
General policy requires that every reasonable effort be made to avoid an overlap. Ideally, a group of persons should
be included in the field of membership of only one credit union. 

New credit unions are obligated to investigate the possibility of an overlap prior to submitting an application for
a new charter by surveying the prospective field of membership. 

When a potential overlap situation does arise, officials of the involved credit unions must attempt to work the problem
out between or among themselves. In the case of a new federal credit union applying for or converting to a community
field of membership, the applicant will generally be required to contact only those credit unions with a service facility
within the community boundary. Other credit unions serving select groups within the proposed area will not ordinarily
be contacted or afforded overlap protection unless a significant portion of their field of membership is affected.
If the matter is resolved informally, the applicant must submit a letter to that effect from the credit union whose
field of membership already includes the subject group. 

If no resolution is possible, an application for a new charter may still be submitted, but must also include information
regarding the overlap and document attempts at informal resolution. Documentation on the interests of the group,
such as a petition signed by a majority of the group's members, will be strongly considered. 

When resolution of the issue is not possible, and other circumstances warrant, an overlap may be permitted. Among
the circumstances which may justify an overlap are: 

 Failure of the original credit union to provide quality service. 

 Limited participation by members or employees of the group in the original credit union after the expiration
of a reasonable period of time. 

 Incidental overlap_the group of persons in question is so small as to have no material effect on the original
credit union. 

In reviewing the overlap, the regional director will consider the nature of the issue, efforts made to resolve the
matter, financial effect on the overlapped credit union, the desires of the group(s), the desire of the sponsor organization,
the opinion of the state credit union supervisor and other interested parties, as applicable, and the best interests
of the affected group and the credit union members involved. 

Potential overlaps of a state credit union's field of membership by a federal credit union will generally be analyzed
in the same way as if two federal credit unions were involved. However, where a state credit union's field of membership
is so general as to include virtually everyone in a wide area, NCUA may exclude any state credit union from overlap protection
altogether just as it would with a federal credit union with a broadly defined field of membership. Prior to making
that decision, the regional director will consult the credit union and the state regulator. Any decision by the regional
director will be provided in writing to the credit union and the state regulator. 

Generally, NCUA will permit federal credit unions serving occupational groups to overlap associational and community
charters. However, should the proposed overlap pose significant safety and soundness concerns, NCUA may provide
overlap protection for any type charter. For example, labor union groups constitute an associational common bond,
and while some labor unions serve members who work regularly for several employers, others have members who work for
only one employer. In these latter cases, overlap protection may be provided if a substantial portion of the company's
employees are served by the credit union. 

Some situations may not justify approval of a requested overlap. For example, if the requesting credit union offers
certain specialized services not offered by the original credit union (such as credit cards, ATMs, and IRAs), the
extra services alone may not justify the overlap. Also, proximity, by itself, may not warrant approval of an overlap.
A federal credit union in Chicago, Illinois, may not have a convincing argument, based on geography alone, that a select
group also located in Chicago would be better served by it than by the select group's headquarters credit union located
in Dallas, Texas. 

From an overlap prevention perspective, new charter applicants and every occupational or associational group which
comes before the regional director for affiliation with an existing federal credit union must advise in writing whether
the group is included within the field of membership of any other credit union. This requirement will alert the regional
director to possible overlap situations before they occur. Most potential field of membership conflicts can be avoided
in this way. If cases do arise where the assurance given to a regional director concerning unavailability of credit
union service turns out later to be inaccurate, the misinformation is grounds for removal of the group from the federal
credit union's charter.

IV.B.2_Overlap Issues as a Result of Organizational Restructuring


A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the group descriptions contained in Section
5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the
credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of a group described in Section
5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiary, the group cannot be served
until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership.
Overlaps may occur as a result of restructuring of the parent organization. Credit unions affected by organizational
restructuring are required first to attempt to resolve overlap issues among themselves. Once the affected credit
unions reach agreement, they must apply to NCUA for a modification of their fields of membership to reflect the groups
each will serve.
In addition, credit unions must submit to NCUA correspondence from the parent organization explaining the restructuring
and providing information regarding the new organizational structure. To help in future monitoring of overlaps,
the organizational structure should identify divisions and subsidiaries and the location and number of employees
at each location.
Overlaps may also occur as a result of the parent organization's merger. NCUA's general policy of avoiding overlaps
applies to those resulting from corporate mergers as well. Affected credit unions must make every reasonable effort
to identify up front and address the overlap issue raised by parent corporation mergers and must attempt to resolve
any differences among themselves. In those rare cases which require NCUA's intervention, all attempts to resolve
the issues must be fully documented by the affected credit unions.
Affected credit unions should consider consolidation (merger) of institutions as a possible alternative to dividing
up the field of membership, particularly if safety and soundness concerns exist or future viability is in question.
A federal credit union which has a broad based field of membership generally has a better chance of survival when a sponsor
restructures or closes.
While neutral, NCUA will make the final decision regarding field of membership amendments, taking into account the
credit unions' agreements, safety and soundness concerns, the desires of the members, the significance of the overlap
and other relevant issues.
NCUA will be flexible when working with credit unions affected by parent corporation mergers and divestitures. Where
no other credit union service is available and the sponsor and its employees desire to continue service, NCUA may use
wording such as the following:
``Employees of XYZ Corporation, formerly a subsidiary of ABC, Incorporated, located in Charleston, South Carolina.
. . .''


IV.B.3_Overlaps-Exclusionary Clauses


This discussion pertains to new and existing charters.)


Where two credit unions agree and/or NCUA has determined that an overlap should be avoided, this decision may need
to be memorialized in a federal credit union's charter through an exclusionary clause. Examples of exclusionary
wording are:
 Persons who work for Hilo Sugar Company, except those who work in or are paid from or are supervised from San Francisco,
California.
 Persons who work for the ABC Co., except those employed by the XYZ Division as of June 30, 1994.
 Persons who work for the ABC Co., except those who were members of the XYZ Federal Credit Union as of June 30, 1994.
Exclusionary clauses are very difficult for credit unions and NCUA to monitor properly. To minimize this difficulty,
NCUA generally does not require federal credit unions to apply exclusionary clauses to persons eligible for membership
in another credit union simply because they are one of the ``other persons sharing common bond'' listed in Section
II.E of this Chapter.
Moreover, if phrased improperly or used in situations for which they are not suited, exclusionary clauses can be ineffective
or create obvious inequities_one spouse may be eligible for membership in a federal credit union while the other may
not; one employee may be eligible for credit union service while the person working next to him or her may not. For this
reason, exclusionary clauses are rarely if ever appropriate for inclusion in a community charter's field of membership
as a way to resolve overlap concerns.

One example of an appropriate use of an exclusionary clause may be where there is a merger of two corporations served
by two credit unions which will continue to serve their groups as they had prior to their sponsors' consolidation.
Addition of an exclusionary clause to the field of membership of one or both of the credit unions may be the best way to
clarify the division of service responsibility within the new corporate entity.


When an exclusionary clause is included in a federal credit union's field of membership, NCUA will strive to define
as precisely as possible:


 The identity of the group to be excluded;


 Whether the exclusion is to apply to the entire group or only to those who are actually members of another credit
union; and


 Whether the exclusion is to apply only to the current members of the group or to future members as well.



V_Special Situations




There are some instances where, because of overriding policy, special common bond rules apply. To ensure quality
service to as many low-income and senior citizens as possible, NCUA has established broader common bond rules for
federal credit unions seeking to serve those groups. Further, to expedite service to groups in industrial parks,
shopping centers, and similar areas, the documentation requirements for federal credit unions seeking to serve
these groups have been simplified. Finally, to ensure consistency throughout the credit union movement, NCUA has
centralized decision making for the corporate credit union program in the Central Office.



V.A_Low-Income Credit Union Groups



V.A.1_General




A low-income credit union is defined in Part 701.32 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations as one where a majority of its members
either earn less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
or whose annual income falls at or below 80 percent of the median household income for the nation. In documenting its
low-income membership, a credit union that serves a geographical area where a majority of residents fall at or below
the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-income members.


A credit union designated by NCUA as serving predominantly low-income members has greater flexibility in accepting
non member deposits insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. It also may participate in special
funding programs such as the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions if it is involved in the
stimulation of economic development and community revitalization efforts. A credit union participating in the
revolving loan program is also eligible for technical assistance. The requirements for participation in the revolving
loan program are set forth in Part 705 of NCUA's Regulations. Only operating credit unions are eligible for participation
in the revolving loan program.


A federal credit union charter applicant meeting the definition of a low-income credit union should forward a separate
request for low-income designation, along with appropriate documentation, at the time the charter application
is submitted. A charter applicant's low-income designation will be based on its primary field of membership and not
on its actual members as is the practice for operating credit unions. In most cases, if the credit union qualifies,
NCUA will grant the charter and low-income designation simultaneously.


A low-income federal credit union charter applicant may contract with a third party to assist in the chartering process.
Even after the charter is granted, a low-income credit union may contract with a third party to provide necessary management
services. Such contracts should be for a duration of one year subject to renewal. However, within three years of commencement
of operations, the credit union should no longer require such services.



V.A.2_Special Common Bond Rules for Low-Income Federal Credit Unions




Generally, a low-income credit union is chartered as a community or associational credit union. A low-income credit
union that has a community common bond may include the following language in its field of membership:


``Persons who live in [the target area]; persons who regularly work, worship, perform volunteer services, or participate
in associations headquartered in [the target area]; persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress
which are located in [the target area]; incorporated and unincorporated organizations located in [the target area]
or maintaining a facility in [the target area]; and organizations of such persons.''


In recognition of the special efforts needed to help make credit union service available to persons in low-income
communities, NCUA permits credit union chartering and field of membership amendments based on associational groups
formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low-income persons. The association must
be defined so that all its members will meet the low-income definition of Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. The association,
in documenting its low-income membership, may use the same types of documentation as is currently permitted for determining
whether a community is low-income under Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations.


In addition, a proposed low-income community or associationally based federal credit union may include in its field
of membership, without regard to location, another group constituting an occupational, associational or community
common bond. Except for the operational area requirements, the proposed credit union must meet all the requisites
for including the group in its charter. Moreover, the proposed credit union must take care to ensure that it will continue
to meet the requirements for low-income status.



V.A.3_Special Common Bond Rules for Other Federal Credit Unions Seeking to Serve Low-Income Persons




In the interest of making credit union service available to persons in low-income communities, NCUA also permits
any occupational, associational, multiple group, or community federal credit union to include in its field of membership,
without regard to location, communities and associational groups satisfying the low-income definition of Part
701.32 of NCUA's Regulations. The associational group may be formed for the sole purpose of providing eligibility
for federal credit union service, but must comprise only persons meeting NCUA's low-income definition.


The federal credit union adding the low-income community or association must document that the community or association
meets the low income definition in Part 701.32 of NCUA's Regulations, just as is required for a designated low-income
credit union. A federal credit union adding such a community or association, however, would not be able to receive
the benefits, such as expanded use of non member deposits and access to the Community Development Revolving Loan Program
for Credit Unions, offered to low-income credit unions.


A federal credit union that desires to include a low-income community or association in its field of membership must
first develop a business plan specifying how it will serve the entire low-income community. The business plan, at
a minimum, must identify the credit and depository needs of the low-income community or association and detail how
the credit union plans to serve those needs. The credit union will be expected regularly to review the business plan
as well as loan penetration rates in the community to determine if the community is being adequately served. NCUA will
require periodic service status reports on its service to the low-income community and may review the credit union's
service to low-income persons during examinations.



V.B_Retiree and Senior Citizen Groups




Special common bond rules also apply for providing service to retiree and senior citizen groups. It is NCUA policy
to encourage federal credit unions to bring credit union service to senior citizens (aged 50 and over) and retired
persons. To help in this effort, federal credit unions may form associations of such persons for the sole purpose of
providing eligibility for credit union service. Except for the minimum age requirement of 50, the definition of a
senior citizen is left to the credit union's discretion. Moreover, the only documentation requirement for including
such an association in a federal credit union's charter is a written request from the credit union; no request from
the group or copy of the association's charter or bylaws will be needed. In all other respects, however, the requirements
for including an association in a federal credit union's field of membership apply, including those relating to the
credit union's operational area.



V.C_Employees at Industrial Parks, Shopping Centers, and Similar Areas


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00142 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A federal charter may include in its field of membership persons working in a particular industrial park, shopping
mall, office complex, or similar development either through a community or multiple group charter. 
If the multiple group option is selected, NCUA permits the credit union to satisfy the requirement for a request from
each of the groups through a request by the complex owner, leasing agent, or similar responsible official. The complex
owner, leasing agent or similar official must provide information regarding credit union service available to any
segment of the proposed select group amendment or proposed federal credit union. It is up to the applicant credit union
to investigate whether credit union service is already available to any segment of the select group amendment or proposed
charter. 
In general, exclusionary clauses will not be used to protect any overlapped credit union. However, in those cases
where each employee group in the complex has not specifically requested credit union service, NCUA may exercise broad
discretion in addressing overlaps with other credit unions and any request from a group to be removed from the field
of membership. 
The following or similar wording will be used to define groups added under this procedure: ``Employees who regularly
work in the Plaza Mall, New Orleans, Louisiana'' 
If the community option is selected, the industrial park, shopping center, or office complex must meet the standards
for community charters. 


V.D_Corporate Federal Credit Unions


A corporate credit union is defined as one that:
 is operated primarily for the purpose of serving other credit unions, 
 is designated by the NCUA as a corporate credit union, and
 limits natural person members to the minimum required by state or federal law to charter and operate the credit
union. 
Corporate credit unions operate under and are governed by standards different from those applicable to natural person
credit unions. These standards are set forth in part 704 of NCUA's Regulations. 
Supervision of corporate credit unions is the responsibility of NCUA's Office of Examination and Insurance. All
applications for federal corporate charters as well as requested changes to section 5 of the charter of existing corporate
federal credit unions should be directed to that office. 


VI_Name Selection 


It is the responsibility of the federal credit union organizers to ensure that the federal credit union applicant's
name or federal credit union name change does not constitute an infringement on the name of any corporation in their
trade area. This responsibility also includes researching any service marks or trademarks used by any other credit
union in their trade area. NCUA will ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that the credit union's name: 
 is not already being officially used by another federal credit union; 
 will not be confused with NCUA or another federal or state agency, or with another federal credit union; and

 does not include inappropriate language. 
The last three words in the name of every credit union chartered by NCUA must be ``Federal Credit Union.'' 


VII_Steps To Take To Organize a Federal Credit Union 


VII.A_Getting Started


Following the guidance contained throughout this policy, the organizers should submit the proposed field of membership
to NCUA early in the process for written tentative approval. 
Once the field of membership has been tentatively approved, and the organizer is satisfied the application has merit,
the organizers should conduct a preliminary organizational meeting to elect seven to ten persons to serve as subscribers.
The subscribers should locate willing individuals capable of serving on the board of directors, credit committee,
supervisory committee, and as chief operating officer/manager of the proposed credit union. 
The organizers and subscribers should arrange for any meetings necessary to develop the business plan discussed
in section IV.A.4 of this chapter and to complete the documentation for submittal to NCUA. Each of the required documents
is discussed more fully later in this chapter. 
The organizers and subcribers must apply for insurance of member accounts. The Certificate of Resolutions (NCUA
9501) will be executed by the prospective chief executive officer and recording officer. Following action on this
issue, the prospective chief executive officer and chief financial officer will execute the Application and Agreements
for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9500). These documents should be provided to NCUA as part of the charter application.

The organizers and subscribers should also complete an NCUA 4012, Report of Official or Employee, for each prospective
board member, credit and supervisory committee member, and employee. The NCUA 4012s should be submitted to NCUA as
early as possible to enable the necessary credit reports and background checks to be obtained well in advance of the
anticipated charter date. NCUA will pay the direct costs of acquiring such credit and background checks. 
Subsequent organizational meetings may be held to discuss the progress of the charter investigation, to announce
the proposed slate of officials, and to respond to any questions posed at the meeting. 
If NCUA approves the charter application, the subscribers, as their final duty, will elect the board of directors
and credit committee of the proposed federal credit union. The new board of directors will then appoint the supervisory
committee. 


VII.B_Support for Charter Application


VII.B.1_General


As discussed previously in this chapter, applicants for federal credit union charters must, at a minimum, provide
evidence that: 
 the group constitutes a recognized common bond; 
 the subscribers, prospective officials and employees are of good character; and
 the establishment of the credit union is economically feasible. 
In addition, the Federal Credit Union Act requires applicants to submit a sworn organization certificate setting
forth seven criteria (see section entitled ``Subscribers'' earlier in this chapter). In order to process the application
and capture all required information, NCUA has developed certain chartering forms to assist organizers. See Appendix
D for the necessary blank forms. 


VII.B.2_Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001 


Applications for new federal credit unions will be submitted on NCUA 4001. (State-chartered credit unions applying
for conversion to federal charter will use NCUA 4000. See chapter 3 for a full discussion.) The organizer is required
to certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, based on the investigation of the request. Instructions
and guidance for completing the form are provided on the form's reverse. Associational charter applicants must include
a statement of their membership criteria (normally the group's charter or bylaws) and current financial statements
on the associational sponsor. 


VII.B.3_Report of Official and Employee, NCUA 4012


This form documents general background information of each official and employee of the proposed federal credit
union. Each official must complete and sign this form. The organizers must review each of the NCUA 4012s for elements_criminal
convictions, indictments, etc._that would prevent the prospective official or employee from serving in an official
capacity. Further, such factors as past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks
may disqualify an individual. 


VII.B.4_Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008


This document establishes the seven criteria required of subscribers by the Federal Credit Union Act and is signed
by the subscribers and notarized. This document should be executed in duplicate. During his or her on-site contact,
the NCUA staff member assigned to the case will assist in the proper completion of this document.

<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

VII.B.5_Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501


This document certifies that the board of directors of the proposed federal credit union has resolved to apply for
insurance of member accounts and has authorized the chief executive officer and chief financial officer to execute
the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts. This form must be signed by both the chief executive officer
and recording officer of the proposed federal credit union.


VII.B.6_Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500


This document contains the agreements with which federal credit unions must comply in order to obtain National Credit
Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) coverage of member accounts. The document must be completed and signed by both
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Each prospective federal credit union must qualify for
federal share insurance.


VIII_NCUA Review


VIII.A_General


As discussed previously, NCUA may provide tentative approval of the proposed federal credit union's field of membership.
Additionally, credit and background investigations may be conducted concurrently by NCUA with other work being
performed by the organizers and subscribers to reduce the likelihood of delays in the chartering process.
Once NCUA receives a complete charter application package, an acknowledgment of receipt will be sent to the organizers
within 10 business days of receipt, and a staff member will be assigned to perform an on-site contact with the proposed
officials and others having an interest in the proposed federal credit union. NCUA will make every effort to process
the application expeditiously.
The staff member will review the application package and verify its accuracy and reasonableness. The staff member
will inquire into the financial management experience, suitability and commitment of the proposed officials and
make an assessment of economic advisability. The staff member will also assist the subscribers in the proper completion
of the Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008. By assisting in the completion of the Organization Certificate, the
staff member may, without indicating his or her endorsement of the charter application, expedite the process.
The staff member will thoroughly analyze the prospective credit union's business plan for realistic projections,
attainable goals, and time commitment. Any concerns will be reviewed with the organizers and discussed with the prospective
credit union's officials.
The staff member will then make a recommendation to the regional director regarding the charter application. His
or her recommendation may include specific provisions to be included in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement.
In most cases, NCUA will require the prospective federal credit union's officials to enter into an agreement not to
engage in certain activities. The agreement is for a limited term_usually two to four years. A sample Letter of Understanding
and Agreement is attached in Appendix B.


VIII.B_Regional Director Approval


Once approved, the board of directors of the newly formed federal credit union will receive a signed charter and bylaws
from the regional director. Additionally, the officials will be advised of the name and mailing address of the examiner
who has been assigned responsibility for supervising and examining the credit union.
Generally, the examiner will contact the credit union officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to
arrange for the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation). Assistance in commencing
operations is generally available through the various trade organizations listed in Appendix F.


VIII.C_Regional Director Disapproval


Where a regional director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, under this Chapter, the organizers will
be informed in writing of the specific reasons for the action. Where applicable, the regional director will provide
information concerning options or suggestions that they could consider for gaining approval or otherwise acquiring
credit union service.
The letter of denial will include the procedure for and other information on the group's right to appeal the decision.


VIII.D_Appeal of Regional Director Decision


The procedures for filing an appeal of any actions taken by NCUA regional directors will be followed. If not included
with the denial notice, a copy of these procedures may be obtained from the regional director who made the decision.
The prospective group may submit substantive new and additional information to the regional director for reconsideration.
In these cases, the request will not be considered as an appeal but as a request for reconsideration by the regional
director. If the request is again denied, the group may proceed with the appeal process.


IX_Future Supervision


Once NCUA has granted a charter to a new federal credit union, an examiner will be assigned to supervise the credit union.
The examiner will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the credit union and ensuring it gets off to a good start.
The examiner will also monitor compliance with the terms of the Letter of Understanding and Agreement. Typically,
the examiner will require copies of monthly board minutes and financial statements.
Each federal credit union is examined regularly to NCUA to determine that it remains in compliance with law and regulation
and to determine that it does not pose undue risk to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.
The Federal Credit Union Act requires all newly chartered credit unions, up to two years after the charter anniversary
date, to obtain NCUA approval prior to appointment of any board member, any credit or supervisory committee member,
or any senior executive officer. Part 701.14 of the NCUA Regulations sets forth the notice and application requirements.
If NCUA issues a Notice of Disapproval, the newly chartered credit union is prohibited from making the change. NCUA
may disapprove an individual serving as a director, committee member or senior executive officer if it finds that
the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual would not be in the best interests of the members
of the credit union or of the public to permit the individual to be employed by or associated with the credit union.

CHAPTER 2_AMENDMENTS TO THE FIELD OF MEMBERSHIP


I_Introduction


As stated in Chapter 1, Section 5 of every federal credit union's charter defines the groups the credit union is legally
entitled to serve. There are a number of instances in which Section 5 may need to be changed. On each of these occasions,
the federal credit union must obtain approval from NCUA before amending its charter.
First, a group not included in a federal credit union's charter may wish to be served by that credit union. This may occur
through agreement between the group and the credit union directly, or through a merger, purchase and assumption (P&A),
or spin-off. Second, a federal credit union may wish to change it common bond entirely_from an occupational to a community
credit union, for example, or vice versa. Third, which is discussed in Chapter 3, a state-chartered credit union may
wish to convert to a federal charter. (The field of membership of a federal credit union converting to a state charter
is determined under applicable state law, except to the extent that the credit union seeks to continue to be federally
insured and the proposed new field of membership would adversely affect the safe and sound operation of the institution.)
Finally, a federal credit union may wish to remove a group from its field of membership_for example, through agreement
with the group or a spin-off.
NCUA's goals with respect to amendments of federal credit union charters are the same as for including groups in the
charters of new federal credit unions. The Agency's analysis, therefore, is also similar, though adapted for the
different circumstances in which the issue arises_primarily the facts that the federal credit union is in existence
and has a history of service that can be evaluated.
The three issues NCUA must evaluate in deciding whether to approve a change in a federal credit union's field of membership
are:
 whether the change satisfies NCUA's common bond requirements;
 whether the interests of the groups to be added are demonstrated; and
 whether the change is economically advisable.


II_Additions Through Direct Agreement With a Group


The most common type of addition to a federal credit union's field of membership is through agreement with the group
itself. The requirements are similar to those for including a group in a federal credit union's charter initially.


II.A_Common Bond Requirement


II.A.1_Additions to Fields of Membership of Occupational, Associational, and Multiple Occupational/Associational
Federal Credit Unions


As with new multiple occupational/associational federal credit unions, occupational and associational groups
may be added to occupational, associational, and multiple occupational/associational federal credit unions in
two ways. If the group is part of an occupational or associational common bond which constitutes a majority of the federal
credit union's field of membership, the group may be added regardless of location. These are commonly called ``common
bond additions.'' For any other occupational or associational common bond, the group must be within the credit union's
operational area. These are commonly called ``select group additions.''
The requirements for common bond additions are identical to those for inclusion of occupational and associational
common bonds in a credit union's initial field of membership; please refer to Section II.A and II.B of Chapter 1 for
guidance. The requirements for select groups additions are similar to those set forth in Section II.D of Chapter 1
for inclusion of other associational and occupational groups in a multiple group federal credit union's field of
membership initially, with this exception: The credit union may add groups within the operational areas of one of
its planned service facilities if:
 The planned facility begins operation shortly after the group is added; and 
 The current field of membership constitutes a significant portion of the total field of membership to be served
initially by the proposed facility. Although the addition of a new select group alone is not enough to justify a planned
service facility, it is permissible to include new groups as partial justification for such a facility.
Moreover, in the case of a planned facility, NCUA may, in its discretion, require financial projections and/or a business
plan supporting amendments around that service facility in order to determine the economic feasibility and to address
any safety and soundness concerns of the amendment.


II.A.2_Additions to the Common Bond of a Community Federal Credit Union


Community federal credit unions, except those designated low-income or distressed, may expand their fields of membership
only by redefining their boundaries. There must be interaction among persons who live or work within the proposed
well-defined neighborhood, community or rural district. The burden of proof for existence of the common bond is placed
upon the applicant credit union.
In the majority of cases where community credit unions are asking to expand their areas of service, and in all cases
where a conversion to a community charter is proposed, an NCUA staff member will make a documented on-site evaluation
of the proposal. The staff member will prepare a separate analysis of the proposed amendment, independent of the credit
union's application. Following completion of the on-site evaluation and regional office review of the staff member's
report, the regional director will act on the proposal. Certain expansions require NCUA Board consideration.



II.A.3_Special Situations
II.A.3.a_General


The special rules for credit unions serving low-income persons, serving retirees and senior citizens over 50 years
old, and serving employees at industrial parks, shopping centers and similar facilities apply equally to field of
membership additions. However, there are two special situations unique to existing federal credit unions: (1) corporate
restructurings and (2) plant or base closings, and other kinds of distress to a substantial portion of a credit union's
membership.


II.A.3.b_Corporate Restructuring





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00145 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If an occupational or associational group within a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial
restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This is an event which requires a
change to the credit union's field of membership if the credit union is to continue to provide service. NCUA will permit
a credit union to add to its field of membership a sold or spun off group to which it has been providing service, without
regard to location, if the group requests continued service, documented by a letter from an official representative,
on the group's letterhead where possible. 



II.A.3.c_Distress Situations



If a major group within the field of membership of any federal credit union_whether occupational, associational,
community or multiple group_suffers a severe economic reversal_e.g., a plant or base closing_one option for the
credit union may be to diversify its field of membership by adding groups desiring to be served. If economically advisable,
NCUA may facilitate the credit union's diversification efforts, to the extent and only until the credit union's viability
is assured, by allowing the credit union to add occupational and associational groups without regard to location.
To obtain this authorization, the credit union must submit a request for designation as a distressed credit union
to its regional director. 

The decision will be based on the totality of the circumstances, including the severity of the economic problem, whether
offsetting gains from the expansion of other groups currently in its field of membership are reasonably foreseeable,
the availability of other groups able to be served, the likely cost the credit union will incur in reorienting itself
to serve those groups, the competitive environment it is operating in, the effect on other credit unions, and the availability
of alternatives such as merger. Prior to making a determination on this issue, NCUA may request such additional information,
including a business plan, as may be appropriate.



II.B_Interests of the Group to be Added



Of primary concern to NCUA is that quality credit union service be provided to all groups served by a federal credit
union. Therefore, with respect to each field of membership addition, NCUA requires documentation from each group
to be added stating that it desires service from the applying credit union. 



II.C_Economic Advisability 



Prior to granting a field of membership addition, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely effect on the credit union's
operations and financial condition and its likely effect on other credit unions. Most of the information needed for
analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will already be available to NCUA through the examination and call
reports; generally, nothing more will be needed. However, in particular cases, a regional director may ask for additional
information prior to making a decision. With respect to a proposed addition's effect on other credit unions, the requirements
on overlapping fields of membership set forth in Section IV.A.2 of Chapter 1 apply here as well. 



II.D_Documentation Required



The documentation needed for community charter additions will vary substantially depending on the circumstances,
and has been described in general terms above. For common bond and select group additions, which constitute the bulk
of amendment requests, the procedures are more standardized. A federal credit union requesting such a change must
submit a formal written request, using the Application for Field of Membership Amendment form shown in Appendix D,
or its equivalent, to the appropriate NCUA regional director. The request must be signed by an authorized credit union
representative. 

The Application for Field of Membership Amendment form must be accompanied by the following: 

 A letter signed by an official representative of the group to be added. Wherever possible, this letter must
be submitted on the group's letterhead stationery_regional directors may, at their discretion, however, accept
such other documentation or certification as they deem appropriate. This letter must indicate: 

 that the group wants to be added to the applicant federal credit union's field of membership;

 whether the group presently has any credit union service available;

 the number of persons currently included within the group to be added and their locations; and

 in the case of a select group addition, the group's proximity to one of the credit union's service facilities
to which the group has access. 

 If the group is eligible for membership in any other credit union, documentation must be provided to support
inclusion of the group under the standards set forth in Section IV.B of Chapter 1. 

 If the group to be included is an associational group, the credit union must, where required as established
in Chapter 1, also provide a copy of the group's charter and bylaws defining the group's purpose, membership classes,
and geographical area.



III_Additions Through Consolidation With Another Credit Union



NCUA supports credit unions desiring to remain a separate entity. However, there are three other ways a federal credit
union can expand its field of membership, two of which result in a credit union's ceasing to exist_by taking in the field
of membership of another credit union through a merger or a purchase and assumption (P&A), or by taking a portion
of a continuing credit union's field of membership through a spin-off. Spin-offs are discussed in Section VI of this
Chapter. 



III.A_Mergers



Generally, the standards applicable to field of membership amendments apply to mergers where the continuing credit
union is a federal charter. In particular, where the merging credit union is state chartered, the field of membership
rules applicable to a credit union converting to a federal charter apply. However, there are some differences:






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00146 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 As to a merger involving a common bond addition, the requirements to provide a request for credit union service
from the corporate, associational, or other unit to be added is not required, since the unit already has credit union
service. 


  As to a merger involving a select group addition: 


  For the same reason, the requirement for a letter from each group included in the credit union's field of membership
is not required. 


  Where a state credit union is merging into a federal credit union, the operational area requirement may be waived
on a proper showing that the state credit union will continue to be able to provide quality credit union service to its
current field of membership as a federal credit union. Upon merging, the state credit union's field of membership
will be worded to conform to the NCUA standards set forth in Chapter 1. Any subsequent field of membership amendments
must comply with applicable amendment procedures. 


  As to a merger of a community credit union into a federal credit union of any type, the continuing credit union
may be permitted to continue to provide service to the merging credit union's members of record as of the merger date
where the operational area requirement is satisfied. Except in the case of an emergency merger, the continuing federal
credit union can obtain only the members of record of the merging community credit union. 

 Where both credit unions are community charters, the continuing credit union is a federal credit, and the criteria
for expanding the service area of a community federal credit union (as discussed previously in this Chapter) are satisfied,
the entire field of membership of the merging credit union may be added to the continuing federal credit union's charter.


 Mergers must be approved by all affected NCUA regional directors, and, as applicable, the state regulators. 

 

III.B_Emergency Mergers 

 

A specifically designated emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to field of membership or other
legal constraints. An emergency merger involved NCUA's direct intervention. The credit union to be merged must either
be insolvent or will likely become insolvent within 12 months and NCUA must determine that: 


  an emergency requiring expeditious action exists


  other alternatives are not reasonably available


  the public interest would best be served by approving the merger 

 In an emergency merger situation, NCUA takes an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit
union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise
to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability. 

 As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred
intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions and without
changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for future amendments. Under this authority, therefore,
a federal credit union may take into its field of membership a group defined by a community or associational common
bond permitted under state law, regardless of whether that common bond definition could be approved under the Federal
Credit Union Act. 

 

III.C_Purchase and Assumptions (P&A's) 

 

Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known
as a purchase and assumption (P&A). 

 A P&A has limited application because the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation.
However, in the few instances where a P&A may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers,
may acquire the entire field of membership along with specified loans, shares and certain other designated assets
and liabilities, without regard to field of membership amendment restrictions and without changing the character
of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. 

 P&A's involving federally insured state credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all affected
regional directors and, as applicable, the state regulators. 

 

IV_Field of Membership Conversions 

 

A community federal credit union may convert to an occupational, associational, or multiple group credit union,
and an occupational, associational, or multiple group credit union may convert to a community credit union. In any
case, a change to the credit union's field membership will be necessary. 

 

IV.A_Conversion to Occupational, Associational, or Multiple Group Federal Credit Union 

 

A community federal credit union converting to an occupational, associational, or multiple group field of membership
must meet the common bond and economic advisability requirements applicable to the type of charter which it seeks
conversion to. 

 

IV.B_Conversion to Community Charter 

 

An existing occupational, associational or multiple group federal credit union may apply to convert to a community
charter. In most cases, groups currently in the credit union's field of membership but outside the new community credit
union's boundaries may be included in the new community charter. 

 In order to support a case for a conversion to community charter, the applicant federal credit union must develop a
detailed business plan incorporating the following data: 


  Current financial statements, including the income statement and a summary of loan delinquency. 


  A map or maps showing both the existing and proposed boundaries for the field of membership. 


  A written description of the area of community service for the proposed community credit union. 


  The most current population figures for the existing and proposed boundaries. 


  The source of the population information; census data are considered the most authoritative; the greater
the population of the proposed area, the greater justification necessary to support the existence of the ``community''
and interaction among its residents. 


  Evidence in the form of surveys or letters from official representatives of prominent groups located in the
area to be added showing that the persons who live, work, or worship in the area are interested in affiliating with the
applicant credit union. 


  Evidence that the proposed area is a ``community'' as defined in ``Community Common Bond'' in Chapter 1. 


  Information concerning the availability of financial services to the residents of the new area. 


  A list of credit unions with a home or branch office in the proposed area. (If present credit union service to
the residents of the new area is adequate, there may be no basis for the proposed conversion.) 


  The attitude of current credit union sponsors and existing credit union members toward the proposed conversion.



  The anticipated financial impact on the credit union in terms of need for additional employees and fixed assets.


 

V_Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership 

 

Credit unions may request removal of a group from its field of membership for various reasons. 

 The most common reasons for this type amendment are: 


  The group is within the overlapping field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service.



  The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group. 


  The group has ceased to exist. 


  The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support.


  The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the regional director
will determine why the credit union wishes to remove the group and whether the existing members of the group will continue
membership. Membership may continue for those who are already members if the credit union has adopted the ``once a
member, always a member'' bylaw provision.



VI_Spin-Offs



A ``spin-off'' occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities,
shares and capital of a credit union, are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that
one credit union has a field of membership addition and the other has a removal.

If the spin-off goes to a new federal charter, the requirements of Chapter 1 apply. (See that chapter for discussion
of the field of membership and documentation requirements for new federal charters.) If it goes to an existing federal
charter, the requirements of Chapter 2 apply.

Spin-offs involving federally insured state credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all affected
regional directors and the state regulators, as applicable.

The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, as a minimum:

 Why the spin-off is being requested.

 What part of the field of membership is to be spun-off.

 Whether the affected credit unions have a common sponsor or are located within the same operational area.

 Which assets, liabilities, shares and capital are to be transferred.

 The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions.

 The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members.

 The proposed spin-off date.

The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed
voting ballot.

For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the
same as for mergers_see Part 708 of the NCUA Regulations_except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off_those
whose shares are to be transferred_are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not
be afforded the opportunity to vote. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed
by state statute.



VII_Professional Conflicts



It is important for a credit union, as well as professional organizations such as accounting firms, law firms, real
estate title insurance firms and appraisal firms, to avoid the appearance of impropriety when the credit union contracts
with a professional organization for services. This is even more critical if the professional organization and/or
its employees are members of the credit union.

When a professional organization is added to a federal credit union's field of membership, the credit union should
notify the professional organization of certain provisions. The following notice is intended to ensure that decisions
made by a credit union and the professional organizations serving the credit union are independent of any loan decisions
or deposit activities:

``Please be advised that with respect to the addition of the employees of [professional organization] to the [FCU],
any lending, deposit and/or other credit union services involving this group's members must avoid any appearance
of impropriety and must follow the ethical standards of the profession.''



VIII_Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership



VIII.A_General



All requests for approval to amend a federal charter must be submitted to the appropriate regional director. In normal
cases, the regional director will make a decision on the request within 10 business days. If a decision cannot be made
within that time, the regional director will notify the credit union within the 10-business-day period.

To streamline the process further, NCUA has instituted two additional procedures_a limited preapproval process
and a procedure for easing the workload when making substantial charter changes as with mergers and charter conversions.



VIII.B_Streamlined Expansion Procedure (SEP) for Small Occupational Groups



In keeping with the goals of NCUA chartering policy to provide service to all eligible groups desiring credit union
service, well operated federal credit unions except those designated as ``distressed'' may take advantage of the
SEP for adding occupational groups to their fields of membership.

To use this procedure, the federal credit union's board of directors must first apply to their respective NCUA regional
director for a charter amendment. The charter amendment request must be signed by the presiding officer of the board
of directors.

The following is a sample amendment for permitting a federal credit union to use the SEP authority:

Groups of persons with occupational common bonds which are located within 25 miles of one of the credit union's service
facilities, which have provided a written request for service to the credit union, which do not presently have credit
union service available, and which have no more members in the group than the maximum number established by the NCUA
Board for additions under this provision: Provided, however, that the National Credit Union Administration may
permanently or temporarily revoke the power to add groups under this provision upon a finding, in the Agency's discretion,
that permitting additions under this provision are not in the best interests of the credit union, its members, or the
National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund.

Once NCUA has approved the amendment and the credit union board has adopted it, the SEP authority may be implemented.
The charter amendment permits approved federal credit unions to immediately begin serving employee groups meeting
criteria set forth in this section. Under this procedure, there is no formal NCUA action necessary on each group being
added.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00148 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The maximum number of persons for each group of employees which may be added under SEP will be established by the NCUA
Board from time to time. The number will be based on potential primary members_that is, the persons sharing the basic
occupational affinity to each sponsor group; family members and other derivative members are not included in the
SEP limit. Several groups may be simultaneously added using these procedures; however, the maximum number of persons
for each group must fall within the SEP limit.
The SEP does not apply to associational groups since NCUA must review membership requirements and geographical area
prior to these groups' being added to a field of membership. The procedure also does not apply to community charter
expansions because of the more individualized analysis required.
The following SEP steps and documentation requirements must be adhered to:
 The federal credit union must complete, for each group to be added, an Application for Field of Membership Amendment
form shown in Appendix D
 The federal credit union must obtain a letter, on the group's letterhead where possible, signed by an official
representative identified by title, requesting credit union service and stating that the group does not have any
other credit union service available from any source
 The group must be located within 25 miles of one of the federal credit union's service facilities
 The group must indicate the number of potential members_the number of employees_seeking service
 The federal credit union must maintain the above documentation permanently with its charter
 The federal credit union must maintain a control log of groups added to its field of membership under the SEP
procedure. The control log must include the date the group obtained service, the name and location of the sponsor group,
the number of potential primary members added, the number of miles to the nearest main or branch office, the federal
credit union board of director's approval of the group and the date approved. See Appendix D for a sample control log.
 The groups added under SEP must be reported to the federal credit union's board at the next regular board meeting
and made a part of the meeting minutes
 The control log and other SEP documentation must be made available to NCUA upon request
The regional director may from time to time request service status reports on groups added under SEP. It is advisable
to use some method, such as a sponsor prefix added to the member account number, to readily access data for such groups.
Should a federal credit union fail to provide quality credit union service, as determined by the group's members or
employees, to a group added under SEP, NCUA may subsequently permit dual membership with another credit union.
Should a federal credit union fail to follow the above procedures or deteriorate financially or operationally, NCUA,
at its discretion, may revoke the SEP privilege.


VIII.C_Block Additions


When a state credit union is converting to a federal charter or when a credit union is being merged into a federal credit
union, large blocks of select groups frequently are added to a credit union's field of membership. In such cases, the
federal credit union whose field of membership is being revised should consult directly with the appropriate regional
office early in the process to ensure the efficient treatment of such revisions and to avoid misunderstandings.
Therefore, when a block of 50 or more new groups is being added to a credit union's field of membership at any one time,
NCUA may require that a list of the groups and their locations be provided on a computer diskette. Director coordination
with the appropriate NCUA regional office will ensure the compatibility of hardware and software.


VIII.D_Regional Director's Decision


Except for those field of membership amendments resulting from use of the SEP, all such amendment requests will be
reviewed by regional office staff in order to ensure conformance to NCUA policy, are properly documented, and do not
cause significantly harmful or unreasonable overlap with the fields of membership of existing credit unions.
NCUA understands and appreciates the importance of timely processing of well-supported amendment requests. Therefore,
NCUA has established a goal of ten business days from the date of receipt in the regional office for processing of a routine,
complete amendment request. A fully documented request, including the Application for Field of Membership Amendment,
that fulfills all of the criteria discussed in this manual and does not require written or telephone follow-up will
normally be processed within this time.
In some cases, an on-site review by NCUA staff may be required by the regional director before acting on a proposed amendment.
In addition, the regional director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership
amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan.
The condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. The economic feasibility of expanding
the field of membership of a credit union with serious financial or operational problems must be carefully considered
if the safety and soundness of the credit union is to be preserved.
In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions which are operating satisfactorily.
If a federal credit union is having difficulty providing good service to its current membership, it may have even more
difficulty serving an enlarged field of membership. In some cases, expanding the field of membership of a struggling
credit union may do more harm than good. A struggling credit union's resources need to be focused on current problems.
Placing an additional strain on these resources by increasing the field of membership may also increase the credit
union's problems.


VIII.E_Regional Director Approval


If the requested amendment is approved by the regional director, the credit union will be furnished a formal, updated
Section 5 of its charter which restates the field of membership, including the requested amendment. After action
by the board of directors, the form should be promptly filed with the credit union's official charter and bylaws.

VIII.F_Regional Director Disapproval




Where a regional director disapproves any application, in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will
be informed in writing of the specific reasons for the action. Where applicable, the regional director will provide
information concerning options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval.


The denial letter will include the procedure for and other information on the credit union's right to appeal the decision.



VIII.G_Appeal of Regional Director Decision




The procedures for filing an appeal of any actions taken by NCUA regional directors will be followed. If not included
with the denial notice, a copy of these procedures may be obtained from the regional director who made the decision.


The prospective group may submit substantive new and additional information to the regional director for reconsideration.
In these cases, the request will not be considered as an appeal but as a request for reconsideration by the regional
director. If the request is again denied, the group may proceed with the appeal process.



IX_Service Status Reports




Federal credit unions which frequently add select groups to their fields of membership should be prepared to furnish
a written summary of the results of their efforts to bring service to the employees or members of the select groups.


The regional directors will periodically request that such federal credit unions submit service status reports
to NCUA showing, at a minimum, the number of primary potential members of each select group added and the number of persons
from each select group who have actually enrolled as credit union members.


These service status reports can be enlarged to require information concerning aggregate share and loan activity
by select group or participation in other credit union services.


In any event, federal credit unions using the select group amendment method should implement an information gathering
system early in their amendment/diversification program to track their progress in providing service to the potential
members of their select groups.


This information will help the credit union to operate more efficiently and will give management the data necessary
to make decisions about marketing strategy, new promotions, implementation of new services, etc.


The service status reports will enable NCUA to determine which federal credit unions are serving newly added groups,
as well as any federal credit unions that are not serving new groups.


If the NCUA determines that a federal credit union is not adequately serving new groups, the regional director may
restrict further amendments and permit the groups not being adequately served to be overlapped with another federal
credit union or remove the select group(s) not being served from Section 5 of the credit union charter.



CHAPTER 3_CHARTER CONVERSIONS



I_Introduction




A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority under which a credit union operates. A credit union's
charter is the instrument granted to the institution by the state or federal government.


Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation;
they are incorporated under federal law.


State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency
responsible for credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits
are federally insured it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction.

A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations.
State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation.


There are two types of charter conversions_federal charter to state charter, and state charter to federal charter.
Although common bond is not an issue from NCUA's standpoint in the case of a federal to state charter conversion, the
procedures and forms relevant to such a conversion have been included.



II_Conversion of a State Credit Union to a Federal Credit Union



II.A_General Requirements




Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a federal credit union. In order to do so, it must:


 Comply with state law regarding conversion;


 File proof of compliance with NCUA;


 File the required conversion application, proposed federal credit union organization certificate and other
documents with NCUA;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00150 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act, e.g., common bond and reserve requirements;
and 

 be granted a charter by NCUA. 

Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a federal charter, including mandatory on-site examination
by NCUA. NCUA will also consult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union's current condition,
management expertise, and past performance. Since the applicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic
advisability of granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case of an initial charter application.


Generally, a converting state credit union's field of membership must conform to NCUA chartering policy. However,
if a converting credit union can demonstrate that it has been effectively serving groups outside what would have been
its operational area if it had been a federal credit union, the regional director, in his or her discretion, may permit
continued service to these groups after conversion. Every reasonable effort will be made to phrase the field of membership
similar to the presentations in Chapters 1 and 2 with individually listed groups and their locations. In any case,
subsequent changes must conform to NCUA amendment policy in effect at that time. 



II.B._Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA 



The following actions are to be taken before submitting a conversion proposal: 

 The credit union board must approve a proposal for conversion. 

 The Application to Convert (NCUA 4401) must be completed. Its purpose is to provide the regional director with
information on the present operating policies and financial condition of the credit union and the reasons why the
conversion is desired. A continuation sheet may be used if space on the form is inadequate. Particular attention should
be given to answering the question on the reasons for conversion. These reasons should be stated in specific terms,
not as generalities. 

 The application must be accompanied by all required attachments including the following: 

 Written evidence that the state regulator is either in agreement with the conversion proposal or, if not in
agreement, the reasons therefor. 

 The Application for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9600) in the case of a state credit union that is not federally
insured. 

 The Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9500). 

 The Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, Conversion of State Charter to Federal Charter (NCUA 4000).


 The most current financial report and delinquent loan schedule. 

 The Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008). Only Part (3) and the signature/notary section of page 4 should
be completed and, where applicable, signed by the credit union officials. The NCUA regional office will complete
the other sections of this document. 



II.C_NCUA Consideration of Application to Convert 



II.C.1_Review by the Regional Director 



The application will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and that the proposal is in compliance with Section
125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. This review will include a determination that the state credit union's field of
membership is in compliance with NCUA's chartering policies. The regional director may make further investigation
into the proposal and may require the submission of additional information to support the request to convert. At this
point, NCUA will conduct an on-site review of the credit union. 



II.C.2_On-Site Review 



NCUA will examine the books and records of the credit union on-site. Non-federally insured credit unions will be assessed
an insurance application fee. 



II.C.3_Approval by the Regional Director and Conditions to the Approval 



The conversion will be approved by the regional director if it is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit
Union Act and meets the criteria for federal insurance. Where applicable, the regional director will specify any
special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to convert a federal charter, including changes to the
credit union's field of membership in order to conform to NCUA's chartering policies. Some of these conditions may
be set forth in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement (``LUA''), which requires the signature of the officials and
the regional director. 



II.C.4_Notification 



The regional director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the conversion.




II.D_Action by Board of Directors 



II.D.1_General 



Upon being informed of the regional director's approval, the board must: 

 Comply with all requirements of the state regulator that will enable the credit union to convert to a federal
charter and cease being a state credit union; 

 Obtain a letter or official statement from the state regulator certifying that the credit union has met all
of the state requirements and will cease to be a state credit union upon its receiving a federal charter. A copy of this
document must be submitted to the regional director; 

 Obtain a letter from the share insurer, if applicable, certifying that the credit union has met all withdrawal
requirements. A copy of this document must be submitted to the regional director. 

 Submit a statement of the action taken to comply with any conditions imposed by the regional director in the
approval of the conversion proposal and, if applicable, submit the signed LUA. 



II.D.2_Application for a Federal Charter 



When the regional director has received evidence that the board has completed the actions described above, the federal
charter and new Certificate of Insurance will be issued. 

The credit union may then complete the conversion as discussed in the following section. Denials are appealable.
(See Chapter 1, section VIII.D.)

II.E_Completion of the Conversion



II.E.1_Effective Date of Conversion



The date on which the regional director approves the Organization Certificate and the Application and Agreements
for Insurance of Accounts is the date on which the credit union becomes a federal credit union. The regional director
will notify the credit union and the state regulator of the date of the conversion.



II.E.2_Assumption of Assets and Liabilities



As of the effective date, the federal credit union will be the owner of all of the assets and will be responsible for all
of the liabilities and share accounts of the state credit union.



II.E.3_Board of Directors' Meeting



Upon receipt of its federal charter, the board will hold its first meeting as a federal credit union. At this meeting,
the board will transact such business as is necessary to complete the conversion as approved and to operate the credit
union in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. Actions
to be taken at this meeting include:

 Change of the credit union's name on all records, accounts, investments and other documents evidencing assets
or liabilities of the credit union;

 Changes to the credit union's books and records:

 As of the commencement of business, the accounting system, records, and forms must conform to the standard
established by NCUA;

 New journal and cash record and general ledger records should be set up. The general ledger accounts for the
state credit union will be posted through the effective date of the conversion, and the new balances will be transferred
to the new general ledger accounts of the federal credit union;

 The income and expense accounts of the state credit union will not be closed unless the conversion is at the close
of an accounting period or is required by the state regulator; and 

 The individual share and loan ledger accounts used by the state credit union may continue to be used.

The federal credit union's name will be properly reflected on these accounts.



II.E.4_Reports to NCUA



Within 10 business days after commencement of operations, the recently converted federal credit union must submit
to the regional director the following:

 Report of Officials (NCUA 4501).

 Financial and Statistical Reports, (Forms FCU 109A, 109B, and 109F, or their equivalent) as of the commencement
of business of the federal credit union.



III_Conversion of a Federal Credit Union to a State Credit Union



III.A_General Requirements



Any federal credit union may apply to convert to a state credit union. In order to do so, it must:

 Notify NCUA prior to commencing the process to convert to a state charter and state the reason(s) for the conversion;

 Comply with the requirements of Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act that enable it to convert to a state
credit union and to cease being a federal credit union; and

 Comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the state regulator.

Particular attention should be given to answering the question on the reasons for conversion. These reasons should
be stated in specific terms, not as generalities.



III.B_Special Provisions Regarding Federal Share Insurance



If the federal credit union wants to continue federal share insurance after the conversion to a state credit union,
it must submit an Application for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9600) to the regional director at the time it requests
approval of the conversion proposal. The regional director has the authority to approve or disapprove the Application.

If the converting federal credit union does not want to continue federal share insurance or if its application for
continued insurance is denied, insurance will cease in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of the Federal
Credit Union Act.

If, upon its conversion to a state credit union, the federal credit union will be terminating its federal share insurance
or converting from federal to non federal share insurance, it must comply with the membership notice and voting procedures
set forth in Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act and Part 708 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations.

Where the state credit union will be non federally insured, federal insurance ceases on the effective date of the charter
conversion. If it will be otherwise uninsured, then federal insurance will cease one year after the date of conversion
subject to the restrictions in Section 206(d)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act. In either case, the state credit
union will be entitled to a refund of the federal credit union's NCUSIF capitalization deposit and any unused portion
of the federal insurance premium after the final date on which any of its shares are federally insured.

The NCUA Board reserves the right to delay the refund of the capitalization deposit for up to one year if it determines
that payment would jeopardize the NCUSIF.



III.C_Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA



Upon approval of a proposition for conversion by a majority vote of the board of directors at a meeting held in accordance
with the federal credit union's bylaws, the conversion proposal will be submitted to the regional director and will
include:

 A current financial report;
 A current delinquent loan schedule;
 An explanation and appropriate documents relative to any changes in insurance of member accounts;
 A resolution of the board of directors;
 A proposed Notice of Special Meeting of the Members (NCUA 4221);
 A copy of the ballot to be sent to members (NCUA 4506);
 Evidence that the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and
 A statement of reasons supporting the request to convert.


III.D_Approval of Proposal to Convert


III.D.1_Review by the Regional Director


The proposal will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit
Union Act. The regional director may make further investigations into the proposal and require the submission of
additional information to support the request.



III.D.2_Conditions to the Approval


The regional director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to proceed with
the conversion.



III.D.3_Approval by the Regional Director



The proposal will be approved by the regional director if it is in compliance with Section 125 and, in the case where
the state credit union will no longer be federally insured, the notice and voting requirements of Section 206 of the
Federal Credit Union Act.



III.D.4_Notification



The regional director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the proposal.



III.E_Approval of Proposal by Members



Upon approval of the proposal by the regional director, the following actions will be taken by the board of directors:

 The proposal must be submitted to the members for approval and a date set for a vote on the proposal. The proposal
may be acted on at the annual meeting, at a special meeting for that purpose, or by written ballot to be filed by the date
set for the vote.

<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Members must be given advance notice (NCUA 4221) of the meeting at which the proposal is to be submitted in accordance
with the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Bylaws (Article V). The notice shall:

 Specify the purpose, time and place of the meeting;

 Include a brief and accurate statement of the reasons for and against the proposed conversion, including any
effects it could have upon share holdings, insurance of member accounts, and the policies and practices of the credit
union;

 Inform the members that they have the right to vote on the proposal at the meeting, or by written ballot to be filed
not later than the date and time announced for the annual meeting, or at the special meeting called for that purpose;

 Be accompanied by a Ballot for Conversion Proposal (NCUA 4506); and

 State in bold face type that the issue will be decided by a majority of members who vote.

 A copy of the notice of the meeting shall be delivered to the regional director at the same time that it is delivered
to the members.

 The proposed conversion must be approved by a majority of all of the members who vote on the proposal, a quorum
being present, in order for the credit union to proceed further with the proposition. Ballots cast by members who did
not attend the meeting but who submitted their ballots in accordance with instructions above will be counted with
votes cast at the meeting. In order to have a suitable record of the vote, the voting at the meeting should be by written
ballot as well.

 The board of directors shall, within 10 days, certify the results of the membership vote to the regional director.
The statement shall be verified by affidavits of the Chief Executive Officer and the Recording Officer on NCUA 4505.



III.F_Compliance With State Laws



If the proposition for conversion is approved by a majority of all members who voted, the board of directors should
then:

 Ensure that all requirements of state law and the state regulator have been accommodated;

 Ensure that the state charter or the license has been received within 90 days from the date the members approved
the proposal to convert;

 Ensure that the regional director is kept informed as to progress toward conversion and of any material delay
or of substantial difficulties which may be encountered.

If the conversion cannot be completed within the 90-day period, the regional director should be informed of the reasons
for the delay.



III.G_Completion of Conversion



In order for the conversion to be completed, the following steps are necessary:

 The board of directors will submit a copy of the state charter to the regional director within 10 days of its receipt.
This will be accompanied by the federal charter and the federal insurance certificate. A copy of the financial reports
(FCU 109A and 109B) as of the preceding month-end should be submitted at this time.

 The regional director will notify the credit union and the state regulator is writing of the receipt of evidence
that the credit union has been authorized to operate as a state credit union.

 The credit union shall cease to be a federal credit union as of the effective date of the state charter.

 If the regional director finds a material deviation from the provisions that would invalidate any steps taken
in the conversion, the credit union and the state regulator shall be promptly notified in writing. This notice may
be either before or after the copy of the state charter is filed with the regional director. The notice will inform the
credit union as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will not be effected and completed until the improper
actions and steps have been corrected.

 Upon ceasing to be a federal credit union, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions
of the Federal Credit Union Act, except as may apply if federal share insurance coverage is continued. The successor
state credit union shall be immediately vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of
the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. Operation
of the credit union from this point will be in accordance with the requirements of state law and the state regulator.

 If the regional director is satisfied that the conversion has been accomplished in accordance with the approved
proposal, the federal charter will be canceled.

 There is no federal requirement for closing the records of the federal credit union at the time of conversion
or for the manner in which the records shall be maintained thereafter. The converting credit union is advised to contact
the state regulator for applicable state requirements. The credit union shall neither use the words ``Federal Credit
Union'' in its name nor represent itself in any manner as being a federal credit union.

 If the state credit union is to be federally insured, the regional director will issue a new insurance certificate.

Charters are issued by the National Credit Union Administration for federal credit unions and by the designated state
chartering authority for credit unions organized under the laws of that state.

Commond bond_The characteristic or combination of characteristics which distinguishes a particular group of persons
from the general public. There are only three common bonds which can serve as a basis for a group's forming or being included

association (``associational common bond''), and residence, employment, or religious affiliation in the same
geographic area (``community common bond'').

Community common bond_Residence or employment of persons and businesses and other legal entities located within
the same well-defined neighborhood, community or rural district.

Community credit union_A credit union whose field of membership consists of persons who live or work in the same well-defined
neighborhood, community, or rural district.

by the National Credit Union Administration. Coverage is provided for qualified accounts in all federal credit unions
and participating state credit unions.

Field of membership_The persons (persons may include organizations and other legal entities) a credit union is permitted

of one credit union by another credit union. The purchased and assumed credit union must first be placed into involuntary
liquidation.

Select group_An occupational or associational group with its own common bond.

Secondary or derivative members_Members included in the field of membership by virtue of their close relationship
to a common bond group (e.g., immediate family members, employees of the credit union, etc.).

Service facility_A facility staffed by a credit union representative which accepts share deposit and accepts loan
applications or disburses loans. An ATM or similar device is not a federal credit union service facility. Similarly,
a branch or service center shared by a number of credit unions is not a service facility for purposes of meeting the operational
area requirements of non-common bond expansions.

Appendix B_Letter of Understanding and Agreement



To the Board of Directors and Other Officials



XXXX

 Federal Credit Union



Since the purposes of credit unions are to promote thrift and to make funds available for loans to credit union members
for provident and productive purposes, and since newly chartered credit unions do not generally have sufficient
reserves to cover large losses on loans or meet unduly large liquidity requirements, Federal insurance coverage
of member accounts under the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund will be granted to the above named credit union
subject to the conditions listed in this Letter of Understanding and Agreement and in the Organization Certificate
and Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts. These terms are listed below and are subject to acceptance
by authorized credit union officials.

1. The credit union will refrain from soliciting or accepting brokered fund deposits from any source without the prior
written approval of the Regional Director.

2. The credit union will refrain from the making of large loans, that is, loans in excess of 5 percent of unimpaired capital
and surplus, to any one member or group of members without the prior written approval of the Regional Director.

3. The credit union will not establish or invest in a Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO) without the prior written
approval of the Regional Director.

4. The credit union will not enter into any insurance programs whereby the credit union member finances the payment
of insurance premiums through loans from the credit union.

5. Any special insurance plan/program, that is, insurance other than usual and normal surety bonding or casualty
or liability or loan protection and life savings insurance coverage, which the credit union officials intend to undertake,
will be submitted to the Regional Director of the National Credit Union Administration for written approval prior
to the officials committing the credit union thereto.

6. The credit union will prepare and mail to the district examiner financial and statistical reports as required by
the Federal Credit Union Act and Bylaws by the 20th of each month following that for which the report is prepared.

7. As the credit union's officials gain experience and the credit union achieves target levels of growth and profitability,
the above terms and conditions may be renegotiated by the two parties.

We, the undersigned officials of the 

XXXXX

 Federal Credit Union, as authorized by the board of directors, acknowledge receipt of and agree to the attached Letter
of Understanding and Agreement dated 

XXXXX

 19

XX

.

This Letter of Understanding and Agreement has been voluntarily entered into with the National Credit Union Administration.
We agree to comply with all terms and conditions expressed in this Letter of Understanding and Agreement.

Should the NCUA Board determine that these terms and conditions have not been complied with or that the board of directors
or other officials have not conducted the affairs of the credit union in a sound and prudent manner, the NCUA Board may
terminate insurance coverage of the credit union. If actions by the officials, in violation of this Letter of Understanding
and Agreement, cause the credit union to become insolvent, the officials assume such personal liability as may result
from their actions.

The term of this Letter of Understanding and Agreement shall be for the period of at least 24 months from the date the
credit union is insured. This Letter of Understanding and Agreement may, at the option of the Regional Director, be
extended for an additional 24 months at the end of the initial term of this agreement.

Appendix E_Use of Outside Agents to Solicit Field of Membership Amendments and Members



Purpose



This appendix addresses the National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) experience with credit unions and arrangements
whereby agents outside the organization of the credit union solicit credit union membership in conjunction with
the sale of products or services. This section also provides guidelines for these arrangements.



While these guidelines are not mandated by federal law or regulation, they do represent what the NCUA considers to
be safe and sound policies and procedures to protect the credit union's assets. Since state laws vary, the guidance
may not address every area. Thus, each credit union considering such ventures should obtain a written legal opinion
from its counsel, as well as financial counseling from its normal sources.



Background





As credit unions continue to grow and expand their fields of membership to select groups, there has been an increased
interest by vendors in mutually beneficial relationships. These business dealings involve the vendor selling services
or products and may also include the credit union's financing the sale of items. Generally, such arrangements operate
as follows:

 The vendor contacts select group sponsors providing information on the credit union and the insurance or other
product to be offered. Alternatively, credit unions may initiate relationships, typically with an automobile dealer,
to finance autos. This is commonly called ``indirect lending''.

 The vendor assists the sponsor in requesting inclusion in the credit union's field of membership. With an indirect
lending arrangement, the vendor may have the purchaser prepare a membership application and promptly submits the
application, usually by a fax, to the credit union.

 After the field of membership amendment is approved by NCUA or the state regulator, the vendor arranges to meet
with employees. In the case of individual membership applications, approval or denial by the credit union's membership
officer is required prior to consideration of lending activity. Under no circumstances may a credit union provide
membership services conditioned upon subsequent action approving membership.

 The vendor represents the credit union to the employees and enrolls them into membership in accordance with
appropriate laws, regulations, and bylaws.

 The vendor explains the products or services being marketed and enrolls the employee in a program or plan. In
the case of insurance plans, policies are typically paid by periodic installments, and frequently in one lump sum.

 The vendor arranges for payroll deductions to the credit union. If the employee has an insurance policy or some
other plan with periodic installments, generally, the credit union's deduction is increased and arrangements are
made for the credit union to forward the appropriate amount to the vendor's company.


These arrangements have been beneficial to some credit unions and vendors. The credit union receives a service_solicitation
of members_free of charge. Membership increases and the credit union grows. The vendor has a marketing tool to complement
its marketing program. Additionally, in the case of insurance vendors, if the credit union distributes the premiums
or other payments directly to the vendor's company, the vendor's paperwork is greatly reduced.



Safety and Soundness Issues



NCUA's experience in these arrangements has shown that potential risk to the credit union exists unless prior planning
and internal controls are in place. NCUA has liquidated or taken administrative action in a number of credit unions
in recent years when these controls were absent. Some unsafe and unsound practices are described below:





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The credit union did not investigate the vendor's or the vendor's company's reputation, financial soundness,
or the authority to do business in the state where the credit union operated. In those cases where NCUA liquidated the
credit unions, the companies or firms were of the fly-by-night variety, out to obtain quick profits in short periods
of time. Dealing with well established and reputable firms is important if problems arise to member complaints. Additionally,
in the event of suits against the company or firm, adequate financial standing can often mitigate the credit union's
losses.

 The credit union did not review the programs or products offered to ``its'' new members. In several instances,
the policies were life insurance policies or annuity contracts which called for annual premiums (normally paid by
installments) over long periods of time_20 to 30 years. While normal for such contracts, they generally called for
limited reimbursement in the event of cancellation, for instance 20 percent reimbursement, if canceled before one
year, 45 percent, two years, 55 percent, three years, etc. Many members who enrolled in these contracts did not understand
the terms. When they subsequently canceled the policy and received only a 20 percent return, they held the credit union
responsible. While the credit union had no legal obligation, it presented public relation problems which could have
been avoided.

 The credit union was unfamiliar with the sales techniques used by the vendor to enroll members into the credit
union and in the vendor's programs. In the liquidated credit unions mentioned above, unethical methods were used
to sign unsophisticated members. It was not uncommon to have them just sign blank forms which included a membership
card, payroll deduction authorization, insurance policy, and a loan application and the first year's premium or
other payment.

 The credit union did not provide written instructions to the vendor on procedures to enroll members. Thus the
vendor contacted groups which the credit union was ill-equipped to serve.

 The credit union authorized the vendor to approve loans en masse to cover first year fees or insurance premiums.
NCUA considers this an unsafe and unsound practice which will result in appropriate administrative action. In several
liquidated credit unions which had arrangements with insurance vendors, employees were enrolled in the credit union,
received a loan to pay the first year's premium and authorized payroll deductions.

The reason the insurance agency proceeded in this manner was to be reimbursed immediately by the carrier for new policies.
Such reimbursement ranged from 85 to 105 percent of the first year's premium. Thus an agency that enrolled just 100
new members for $500 per year insurance contracts could have received $42,500 to $52,500 in fees. This desire to obtain
reimbursement clouded the vendor's objectivity and resulted in members having unwanted policies, which they generally
canceled. At a minimum, since the policy holder received only 20 percent return on the policy, the credit union had
a public relations problem collecting its exposed 80 percent. At the worst, the credit union had a loss loan.

 The credit union failed to obtain proper payroll deduction authorizations and authority to remit fees or insurance
premiums to the company. In several cases, payroll deduction for all members, even those who chose not to enroll in
the vendor's program, were sent to the company first. The company then sent the unauthorized fee or premium deductions
to the credit union. This procedure exposed the credit union to misappropriation of funds by the company, to a potential
surety problem, and to an uninsured status until the funds were received in the credit union.

 In another case, a vendor contracted with a credit union to assist credit union members select, locate, and
negotiate the purchase or lease of automobiles. Members paid a fee to the vendor during the closing transactions.
The vendor also provided marketing assistance to attract select employee groups into the credit union.The vendor
was alleged to have falsified and concealed material facts and to have aided prospective credit union members in falsifying
credit information to the credit union in attempts to obtain credit. In some cases the prospective member obtained
possession of the automobile prior to being accepted as a member and in other cases prior to being approved for the financing.
Other operational issues that have led to abuses are the following:

(1) The dealer directly accepting the borrower's payments.

<DOCNO> FR940603-0-00159 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-0-00029 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The dealer making payments on behalf of the borrower potentially disguising past due accounts.
(3) The borrower/purchaser applying for the title potentially resulting in an improperly recorded lien.
(4) The dealer financing the down payment thus allowing the borrower to have no stake in the collateral.
(5) The credit union permitting or initiating overdrafts in the vendor reserve or holdback accounts. (Sometimes
the credit union requires deposits from the dealer to be held by the credit union to better assure good faith performance
by the vendor.)
(6) The credit union placing full reliance on the dealer for credit checks.
(7) Financing indirect loans that are out of the credit union's normal trade area.
(8) The dealer adds costs to the purchase price, such as insurance, warranties, and taxes, thus leaving the borrower
with no equity in the car, and the lender with an undercollateralized loan.
(9) Dealers generate a large volume of loans in an attempt to overwhelm credit union staff in hopes that the weaker loans
will be approved. (There are instances where dealers resubmit previously denied loans during peak periods in attempts
to get them approved.)
(10) The dealer inflates the purchase price or the trade in values, resulting in undercollateralized loans.
(11) An increased potential for making loans to persons who are not eligible to be credit union members exists because
of dealer involvement.
(12) By allowing the dealer to negotiate the contract, including interest rates, there is a possibility of inequity
among members.
In many instances, the prospective credit union member was pressured to solicit his employer for inclusion into the
credit union's field of membership. In certain of these instances, the employer group had existing credit union affiliation
with another credit union. In certain other instances, the vendor indicated the prospective member was affiliated
with a legitimate group in the credit union's field of membership, when, in fact, the person was not employed by the
group. The vendor failed to properly complete required documentation for loans and lease agreements. In some cases
the vendor indicated excessively high annual mileage limits in lease agreements.


Recommended Investigative Procedures


Before entering into an agreement with a vendor acting as the credit union's agent in soliciting membership, a federally
insured credit union should thoroughly investigate the impact of this action on its financial operations and condition;
determine its legal liabilities; clearly define its moral responsibilities; and assure proper control of these
activities. The following steps are recommended:
 Thoroughly investigate the financial condition of all corporations, partnerships or other entities involved
in the activities. Obtain and review financial statements and credit reports, such as Dun and Bradstreet, on each
entity. Consider the need for appropriate bonding by each company.
 Review the organizational structure and reputation of each entity. Included in the review should be a certification
that each entity is authorized to do business in the state where the credit union is authorized to do business.
 Review and approve the contracts or policies to be offered. Since members may hold the credit union morally
responsible for problems which may occur, the officials should consider the impact of each contract or policy on its
public relations with members.
 Determine through a written legal opinion that all forms, documents and procedures used by the credit union
to obtain membership, payroll deductions or to transfer funds to a vendor are legal and protect the credit union.
 Ascertain the credit union's liability under the Holder in Due Course rule.
 Determine the type of recourse agreement (full recourse, limited recourse or without recourse) that the credit
union will enter into with the vendor.
 Develop cash flow and budget projections showing the effect of increased membership on the credit union's
financial condition and ability to serve new members.
 Track by individual vendor, loans, loan delinquency and loan losses for each financing derived from the indirect
lending relationship.
 Develop procedures to monitor the activities of vendors as discussed below under Agreements.
 Develop brochures and handouts to be presented to potential members. Among these should be a disclaimer that
the credit union does not endorse the products or services and that the vendor can make no commitments regarding membership
approval or the granting of loans. Other materials to be presented are discretionary by the credit union.
 Obtain written confirmation from surety that such activities are bondable.
 Ensure the individual in charge of indirect lending is experienced with indirect financing or contacts another
credit union with experience in this type of lending.
 Start slow, utilizing only one or two reputable new car dealerships.


Agreements


All arrangements with a vendor should be in writing and reviewed by credit union legal counsel. Such agreements should
include, but not be limited to, the following:
 Scope of the vendor's authority to contact sponsors, such as limits on sponsor's assets, number of employees/potential
members, financial condition, organizational structure, geographical location, and sponsor stability in the
area.
 Procedures for the vendor to follow in contacting sponsors. These should require the vendor to present any
product or service as separate and distinct from credit union membership and to state that inclusion in the field of
membership is subject to regulatory approval. There should be absolute indication that the credit union is not endorsing
any product or services marketed by the vendor.
 Procedures for vendors to follow once a sponsor is included in the credit union's field of membership.
 Procedures for automobile dealers to follow when shopping sales contracts to lenders.
 Understanding and agreements on fees or points paid to automobile dealers.
 Agreement that products or services to be offered and materials, brochures and handouts to be presented by
the vendor are to be approved, in advance, by the credit union.

 Agreement that all approved brochures and handouts of the credit union will be distributed.

 Agreement that credit union representatives may accompany the vendor on contacts with sponsors and on membership
enrollments.

credit union. Generally such an agreement will include a preliminary approval process as well as monitoring standards
to include necessary credit union training.

 Procedures for auditing indirect lending activities with the dealer.

 Any other standard contractual agreements necessary to contract law.



Summary



Credit unions and vendors can engage in mutually beneficial contractual agreements provided that adequate planning
and internal controls are instituted. Credit unions engaging in these activities should plan, direct, and control
these activities in a safe and sound manner.

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule amending the final monograph for over-the-counter
(OTC) antitussive drug products to include the ingredients diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride.
OTC antitussive drug products are used to relieve cough. This final rule addresses only single-ingredient antitussive
drug products containing one of these ingredients. In a future issue of the 

Federal Register

, the agency will propose to amend the tentative final monograph for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and
antiasthmatic combination drug products to address combination cough-cold drug products containing diphenhydramine
citrate or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. This final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted
by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 12, 1987 (52 FR 30042), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC antitussive drug products in part 341 (21 CFR part
341) that lists in  341.14 (21 CFR 341.14) the active ingredients that are generally recognized as safe and effective
for use in these products. Diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride were not included in  341.14
at that time. Subsequently, two manufacturers petitioned the agency to amend the final monograph for OTC antitussive
drug products to include diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride as monograph active ingredients
(Refs. 1 and 2). The petitions are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. 
In the 

Federal Register

 of December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58378), the agency discussed these petitions and proposed that diphenhydramine citrate
and diphenhydramine hydrochloride be generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC antitussive use. The agency
previously determined that diphenhydramine citrate is bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent to diphenhydramine
hydrochloride (54 FR 6814 at 6824, February 14, 1989). The agency proposed specific warnings and directions for these
ingredients for OTC antitussive use. The agency advised in its proposed rule (57 FR 58378 at 58380) that any final rule
resulting from this proposed rule would be effective 12 months after the final rule's date of publication in the 

Federal Register

.
The agency invited written comments by February 8, 1993, on the proposed rule and the agency's economic impact determination
for the proposal. In response to the proposed rule, the agency received two comments from manufacturers. Copies of
the comments are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

II. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments


1. Two comments requested that the agency's proposed OTC antitussive dosage for diphenhydramine hydrochloride
(25 milligrams (mg) every 4 hours (h), not to exceed 150 mg in 24 h) be expanded to a range of 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 h, not
to exceed 300 mg in
