National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are proposing to establish procedures that set forth the principles and practices the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service will follow to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council on Environmental Quality
regulations, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy
Act. These procedures would replace APHIS Guidelines Concerning Implementation of NEPA Procedures.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The regulations of the President's Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) implementing section 102(2) of the National
Environmental Policy Act (hereinafter referred to as NEPA or the Act) are applicable to and binding on all agencies
of the Federal Government. Pursuant to the CEQ implementing regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) is proposing to implement procedures to ensure that its planning and decisionmaking are in accordance
with the policies and purposes of NEPA. The CEQ implementing regulations direct that agencies shall include, at a
minimum, procedures required by 40 CFR 1501.2(d), 1502.9(c)(3), 1505.1, 1506.6(e), 1507.3(b)(2), and 1508.4.
APHIS' proposed procedures would supplant the APHIS Guidelines Concerning Implementation of NEPA Procedures originally
published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 28, 1979 (44 FR 50381-50384) and corrections as published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 31, 1979 (44 FR 51272-51274).


The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service


APHIS, established in 1972 (7 CFR 371.1(a)), is a regulatory and facilitative agency responsible for the protection
of plant and animal health. Its mission is to protect American agriculture by providing leadership in ensuring the
health, safety, and care of animals and plants, improving agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and contributing
to the national economy and public health and safety. APHIS accomplishes this mission by:
1. Excluding exotic plant and animal pests and diseases and noxious weeds.
2. Detecting, monitoring, and managing plant and animal pests and diseases and noxious weeds.
3. Facilitating agricultural imports and exports.
4. Providing for pure, safe, and efficacious veterinary biologics.
5. Protecting the welfare of certain animals.
6. Controlling nuisance mammals and birds.
7. Collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information.
8. Providing scientific and technical services.
APHIS' mission is carried out under five functional areas:
Pest and disease exclusion. APHIS conducts inspection and quarantine activities at U.S. ports-of-entry to prevent
the introduction of exotic animal and plant diseases and pests. APHIS also participates in inspection, survey, and
control activities in foreign countries to reinforce its domestic activities.
Animal and plant health monitoring. APHIS conducts programs to assess animal and plant health and to detect endemic
and exotic diseases and pests.
Pest and disease management programs. APHIS carries out or cooperates in programs to: Control and eradicate animal
and plant pests and diseases; reduce losses caused by wildlife damage; provide technical assistance to State and
local governments, farmer or rancher groups, foundations, and the public; and ensure compliance with interstate
movement and other disease and pest control regulations within the jurisdiction of APHIS.
Animal care. APHIS conducts regulatory activities that ensure the humane treatment and care of certain animals.
Scientific and technical services. APHIS carries out other activities, including the licensing and testing of veterinary
biologicals and the development of standards to ensure their safety and effectiveness, diagnostic activities for
control and eradication programs, applied research for the development of methods and tools, regulatory oversight
to prevent damage and reduce risk, and regulation of imports and exports of terrestrial plants under the Endangered
Species Act.
APHIS conducts cooperative programs with State and local agencies and organizations and foreign countries to eradicate,
manage, or prevent the movement of plant and animal diseases and pests. More than 2,500 exotic insects, plants and
animal diseases, weeds, and vertebrate pests have been identified as posing a potentially serious threat to agriculture
in the United States.
APHIS' inspection and regulatory programs help prevent the introduction into the United States of animal and plant
pests and diseases and noxious weeds of foreign origin and the spread of certain established animal and plant pests
and diseases and noxious weeds within the country. Although limited inspection and testing activities take place
in certain countries of origin, APHIS' port-of-entry inspection and quarantine are the primary line of defense against
exotic pests and pathogens. However, notwithstanding these efforts, pests and pathogens occasionally are introduced
into the United States.
Therefore, in order to comply with NEPA, CEQ, and U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations, we are proposing to
establish regulations in 7 CFR by adding a new part 372 (  372.1 through 372.10) as described below:


Section-by-Section Analysis


Purpose (Section 372.1)


This section would set forth the purpose of the procedures, namely to implement section 102(2) of NEPA by assuring
early and adequate consideration of environmental factors in APHIS planning and decisionmaking and by promoting
the effective, efficient integration of all relevant environmental requirements under NEPA. This strategy of early
and integrated consideration of environmental factors, diligently pursued, will facilitate achieving the requirements
of sections 101 and 102(1) as required by 40 CFR 1505.1(a).


Designation of Responsible APHIS Official (Section 372.2)


This section would designate the Administrator of APHIS, or an agency official to whom the Administrator may formally
delegate the task, as the individual responsible for overall review of APHIS' NEPA compliance.


Information and Assistance (Section 372.3)


This section would provide that information, including the status of studies, and the availability of reference
materials, as well as the informal interpretations of APHIS' NEPA procedures and other forms of assistance, will
be made available upon request to: Environmental Analysis and Documentation, Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental
Protection, APHIS, USDA, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782, (301) 436-8565; FAX (301) 436-8669.

Definitions (Section 372.4)




In addition to the definitions of terms contained in CEQ's implementing regulations, which are incorporated by reference
herein, this section would define four terms which are unique to these proposed regulations. As used in these procedures,
the term ``APHIS'' means the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; ``Decisionmaker'' means the agency official
responsible for executing findings of no significant impact in the environmental assessment process and the record
of decision in the environmental impact statement process; ``Department'' means the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA); and ``environmental unit'' means Environmental Analysis and Documentation, which is an analytical
unit in Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, charged with the responsibility of coordinating
APHIS compliance with NEPA and other environmental laws and regulations.



Classification of Actions (Section 372.5)




This proposed section, developed in four parts, complies with the directive in CEQ's implementing regulations that
agencies classify actions for purposes of the NEPA process (40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2)). The CEQ regulation call for development
of ``specific criteria for and identification of those typical classes of action'' that (1) normally require environmental
impact statements, (2) normally require environmental assessments but not necessarily environmental impact statements,
(3) normally require neither environmental impact statements nor environmental assessments and are therefore
categorically excluded, and (4) normally are categorically excluded but, because of extraordinary circumstances,
may have significant environmental effects and require preparation of environmental documentation.



1. Actions Normally Requiring Environmental Impact Statements




An environmental impact statement (EIS) will normally be prepared for the following types of actions:


 Administrative procedures that seek to establish broad-scale, significant, impact-generating strategies,
methods, or techniques (e.g., treatment options of individual large-scale aerial application of chemicals) as
the means of dealing with pervasive animal and plant health issues within the purview of APHIS.


This category of action might include (1) contingency or ``emergency'' response strategies (comprehensive in scope)_the
design of which is intended to provide solutions, generally on very short notice (thereby severely limiting subsequent
consideration of alternatives by planners and decisionmakers)_to widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases
or similar exigencies; and (2) strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future application in
the context of extensive APHIS programs a preferred course of action having the potential for significant environmental
impact.


 General administrative (programmatic) examination of APHIS strategies and options for dealing with issues
that have important implications for the maintenance and enhancement of environmental quality.


Programmatic environmental impact statements are useful not only when dealing with exigencies of substantial proportion,
but also for any substantive APHIS program as a means of effectively and efficiently integrating environmental considerations,
process, and values into program planning and service delivery efforts. The type of action for which a programmatic
EIS might be appropriate could include an administrative proceeding undertaken to rationalize, prioritize, and
streamline_particularly from the standpoint of competing policies (e.g., environmental policies and economic
development)_essential activities related to program mission and functions. Consider, for example, the scoping
notice for the Veterinary Services programmatic document that was published by APHIS in the 

Federal Register

 on October 9, 1992 (57 FR 46533-46534).



2. Actions Normally Requiring Environmental Assessments




The preparation of program EIS's_whether or not exigent circumstances may be involved_does not relieve APHIS from
taking a ``hard look'' at refinements to, or site-specific implementation of, program alternatives that have not
been ``categorically excluded.'' The following classes of action, which normally do not have the potential to affect
significantly the quality of the human environment, will be evaluated for NEPA purposes in the context of environmental
assessments (EA's), some of which may be tiered to broader programmatic EIS's:


 Policymaking and rulemaking proposals that involve program plans, techniques, methods, or other activities
likely to have a consequential effect on the physical or natural environment or that may affect opportunities for
the public, nongovernmental organizations, and others to influence environmental planning and decisionmaking.


 Development of program plans or similar nonexperimental approaches that seek to establish in more limited
contexts impact-generating strategies, methods, or techniques as the means of dealing with animal and plant health
issues within the purview of APHIS.


Included in this class would be ``action plans'' designed to address proposals to remedy specific problems, including
plant pest infestations, animal diseases, depredating animals, and the like. Other planning activities for which
EA's normally will be prepared include substantial APHIS involvement in the efforts of USDA's Forest Service, the
Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management, States, and Indian Tribes to eradicate or control plant pests,
animal diseases, or depredating or nuisance species in various districts or regions.


 Site-specific implementation of action plans and approaches mentioned in the previous paragraph of this
section, except where isolated activities, introductions, or applications, as developed more fully in the following
subsection entitled ``Categorically Excluded Actions,'' are contemplated.


There are some categories of APHIS action that, while susceptible to consideration in broad programmatic impact
statements undertaken pursuant to NEPA, are usually identified with more resource-specific environmental mandates
and may be the subject of periodic planning and review requirements. In the process of satisfying those requirements,
all operational aspects of APHIS facilities, including storage and disposal of pesticides, chemicals, and laboratory
wastes, will normally be thoroughly examined. But compliance with such planning and review requirements does not
satisfy NEPA, which is applicable to ``adoption of formal plans * * *'' (40 CFR 1508.18(b)(2)).


The following classes of action may be examined in the context of specific environmental mandates other than NEPA,
but will nevertheless be analyzed within an EA in order to facilitate the NEPA decision:


 Planning, design, and construction or acquisition of major new facilities or proposals to modify substantially
existing facilities.


 Disposition of laboratory waste and other hazardous or toxic materials, except as provided under subsection
3 of this section.

<TEXT>
 

Biotechnology and biological control activities within APHIS' oversight authority are conducted pursuant to permits
or other authorizations that may include conditions to protect the environment, the granting of exemption from regulation,
or a notification procedure. These activities normally will be examined in the context of EA's crafted to the permitting
processes:
 Approval and issuance of permits for the release into the environment of genetically engineered organisms
and products, and the release into the environment of exotic organisms.
There is one final category of action that fits within the classification of normally requiring an EA-research and
testing. Not all research and testing, however, need be subjected to the EA process. Only where research or testing
either creates a likelihood of harm to the quality of the human environment or represents an irretrievable commitment
to the resulting technology will EA's normally be required:
 Research or testing that will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment area_field trials,
for example_or that reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of pre-marketing strategies) that forecasts
an irretrievable commitment to new products or technology.


3. Categorically Excluded Actions


The CEQ implementing regulations define the term ``categorical exclusion'' as ``a category of actions which do not
individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have
no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementation of these regulations * * *.''
(40 CFR 1508.4). Environmental documents are not prepared for categorically excluded actions unless exceptional
circumstances, as provided in subsection 4 below, are present. Indeed, CEQ ``strongly discourages procedures that
would require the preparation of additional paperwork to document that an activity has been categorically excluded''
(CEQ Guidance Regarding NEPA Regulations, 48 FR 34265, July 28, 1983).
The Department has promulgated categorical exclusions of actions that are applicable to all departmental agencies
whose procedures do not provide otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3a), are appropriate
for APHIS. Other APHIS actions that qualify for categorical exclusion from the NEPA process are identified herein.
Consistent with CEQ's directive, ``broadly defined criteria'' have been employed to ``characterize types of actions
that, based on APHIS' experience, do not cause significant environmental effects'' (49 FR 34265, July 28, 1983).
Insofar as safeguarding environmental quality is concerned, the proper use of chemicals, pesticides, and other
potentially hazardous or harmful substances, materials, and devices in the development and delivery of program
goods and services is of the utmost concern to APHIS. But not every proposed use of potentially hazardous or harmful
substances, materials, or devices will require application of the NEPA process. Experience suggests that the following
category of actions, individually or cumulatively, will not have a significant effect on the human environment:
 Routine measures employed by the agency to pursue its mission and functions, such as identifications, inspections,
surveys, sampling, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, sanitizing, inoculations, and monitoring, including
the use_according to any label instructions or other lawful requirements and consistent with standard, published
program practices and precautions_of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially hazardous or harmful substances,
materials, and target-specific devices or remedies, provided that such use (1) is localized in nonurban areas to
individual parcels such as farms, ranches, or nurseries, or contained (and not aerially applied or administered)
in urbanized areas to discrete sites that do not cater to the general public, and is limited in terms of quantity, i.e.,
low- or ultra-low volume or individualized dosages and remedies; (2) will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies,
including wetlands; (3) does not adversely affect any federally protected species or critical habitat; and (4) is
not persistent in the environment and does not cause bioaccumulation. All circumstances delineated above (insofar
as they may pertain to a particular action) must be present for any such use to be categorically excluded from the NEPA
process.
Examples of actions covered by this categorical exclusion include inoculation of discrete herds of livestock, or
wildlife treatment strategies undertaken in contained areas (such as a zoo, an exhibition, or an aviary); pesticide
treatments applied to infested plants on a homesite; and isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.
Research and small-scale testing activities represent another category of actions that will require application
of the NEPA process only in very limited contexts_essentially those described in ``Actions normally requiring EA's,
Research and Testing.'' Other statutory requirements (those contained in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act, for example) may be applicable to some research and testing activities regardless of how they
may be classified for NEPA purposes in these procedures. Nevertheless, categorical exclusion from the NEPA process
is appropriate for the following described actions:
 Activities that are carried out in laboratories, facilities, or other areas designed to eliminate the potential
for harmful environmental effects (internal or external) and to provide for lawful waste disposal.
Examples of actions covered by this categorical exclusion include: The development and/or production (including
formulation, repackaging, movement, and distribution) of approved and/or licensed program material, devices,
reagents, and biologics; research, testing, and development of animal repellents; and development and production
of sterile insects.
The following additional categories of actions also qualify for categorical exclusion from the NEPA process:
 Routine precautionary measures, including identifications, inspections, surveys, testing, inoculating,
and monitoring, of a limited scope and intensity that are designed to assure the proper care, protection, and treatment
of animals.
 Rehabilitation of existing laboratories and other APHIS facilities, functional replacement of parts and
equipment, and minor additions to such existing APHIS facilities.
 Agency actions including the issuance of permits, authorization to ship, or licensing involving a category
of veterinary biological product which has been previously licensed, unless the product has been subsequently shown
to be unsafe, or will be used at substantially higher dosage levels or for substantially different applications or
circumstances than in the use for which the product was previously approved. Also, the issuance of a license, permit,
or authorization to ship for field testing products that had not been previously licensed that do not contain live
microorganisms or that are used only for in vitro diagnostic testing.

4. Exceptions for Categorically Excluded Actions 

 

Whenever the decisionmaker determines that an action listed in ``Categorically Excluded Actions'' may have the
potential to affect ``significantly'' the quality of the ``human environment,'' as those terms are defined at 40
CFR 1508.27 and 1508.14, respectively, an environmental impact statement or an EA will be prepared. 

 

Early Planning for Applicants and Non-APHIS Entities (Section 372.6) 

 

This section is designed to satisfy the directive in the CEQ implementing regulations that agencies make provision
``for cases where actions are planned by private applicants or other *
 9*
 9* entities before Federal involvement *
 9*
 9*.'' (40 CFR 1501.2(d)). Written instructions or guidelines outlining what is needed to comply with environmental
planning and documentation requirements for all prospective applicants cannot be included in these procedures.
It is the intention of APHIS ultimately to identify environmental data needs for each major APHIS program that requires
analysis under these procedures and to provide for those needs as an integral part of program standards and practices.
Until that goal can be attained, however, each prospective applicant needing approval for proposed activities normally
requiring environmental documentation is encouraged to contact, at the earliest opportunity, APHIS' program staff,
which will then coordinate with the environmental unit to design an appropriate compliance procedure tailored to
the needs of the particular proposal. 

 

Consultation (Section 372.7) 

 

This section encourages prospective applicants and others to contact APHIS program officials to determine what
types of environmental analyses or documentation, if any, need to be prepared. Early consultation is not intended
to satisfy the requirements of NEPA alone. NEPA documents should incorporate, to the fullest extent possible, surveys
and studies required by other environmental statutes. Implementing regulations of other primary environmental
statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, also make provision for early consultation and resolution of major
issues by prospective applicants. Only by taking full advantage of opportunities for early environmental planning
can APHIS, entities it regulates, the public, and others, avoid excessive costs and undue administrative delays
often associated with a poorly timed environmental analysis process. 

 Questions regarding these procedures and their applicability to particular planning and decisionmaking situations
are inevitable. No procedure, regardless of how meticulously it may have been fashioned, can anticipate every contingency.
For this reason, prospective applicants, and others who may have questions concerning these procedures, their applicability,
meaning, or any other problem, should not hesitate to contact program officials and consult with the environmental
unit at the earliest opportunity. Responses to all such questions will be provided as quickly as possible, in most
cases within a single work day of securing any necessary factual information. 

 

Major Planning and Decision Points and Public Involvement (Section 372.8) 

 

This section is designed to satisfy the directives in the CEQ implementing regulations that agencies (1) designate
``the major decision points for APHIS' principal programs likely to have a significant effect on the human environment
and (assure) that the NEPA process corresponds with them'' (40 CFR 1505.1(b) (1992)); and (2) ``make diligent efforts
to involve the public'' in NEPA-related activities (40 CFR 1506.6). 

 Proposed  372.5(a) of these procedures describes actions that normally require preparation of an EIS. The
narrative explanation for that section emphasizes the desirability of adopting a broad programmatic approach to
NEPA compliance that corresponds with APHIS' planning and service delivery efforts. Furthermore, it is in the planning
stages of policy, program, or project development where the NEPA process can most effectively and efficiently be
employed in the furtherance of the Act's ``pollution prevention'' purpose. 

 Like many agencies, APHIS makes ample use of long-range planning for policy development and formulation of program
strategies. Most major policies and programs are already in place. Still, NEPA is applicable to ongoing activities,
including policies, programs, and projects, no less than it is to new ones (40 CFR 1508.18). Thus, for purposes of rationalizing
and better coordinating existing policies and program strategies consistent with NEPA, a broad programmatic approach
to environmental planning is logical. 

 Planning is often ad hoc in nature and specific points (especially the beginning point) can seldom be anticipated,
at least with respect to particular events, times, or individuals. It may also be difficult to judge at what point in
the planning process a ``proposal'' exists for NEPA purposes.
 The NEPA process will be fully coordinated with APHIS planning. Specific decision points will be identified and communicated
to the public in a notice of intent and in the context of the public scoping process. 

 



A principal purpose of NEPA is to restore public confidence in the Federal Government's capacity to achieve important
public purposes and objectives while at the same time maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment. In
furtherance of that purpose, both the Act and the CEQ implementing regulations require extensive public involvement
in the preparation of necessary environmental documentation. APHIS is committed to an open and accessible NEPA process.
There will be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS process.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00006 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A notice of intent to prepare an EIS will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as it is determined that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect significantly the quality
of the human environment. The notice may include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other
involvement in APHIS' EIS process, including the scoping process, commenting on draft documents, and participation
in the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to the CEQ implementing regulations. 
Early public and other agency involvement is especially useful in the EA process where exigent circumstances (animal
disease or plant pest outbreaks, for example) require rapid APHIS response. In such an event, any EA comment period
would, of necessity, be extremely abbreviated. Opportunities for early public involvement in the EA process will
be announced in the same fashion as the availability of EA's and findings of no significant impact, as specified in
 372.8(b)(3).
Section 1506.6 of the CEQ regulations requires agencies to involve the public and others in implementing their NEPA
procedures which, according to CEQ, ``includes public involvement in the preparation of EA's and findings of no significant
impact. These are public ``environmental documents'' under  1506.6(b), and, therefore, agencies must give
public notice of their availability'' (CEQ, Forty Most Asked Questions Concerning CEQ's National Environmental
Policy Act Regulations, 46 FR 18037, March 23, 1981). Notification of the availability of EA's and findings of no significant
impact for proposed activities will be published in the 

Federal Register

, unless it is determined that the effects of the action are primarily of local concern. Where the effects of the action
are primarily of local concern, notice will normally be provided through publication of notice in a local or area newspaper
of general circulation, or through the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs. Under this order, the State would act as a clearinghouse for review and public notice of the EA. 

See, 

the regulations implementing Executive Order 12372_Intergovernmental Review of Department of Agriculture Programs
and Activities, 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.
All environmental documents, comments received, and any underlying documents, including interagency correspondence
where such correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the environmental impact of proposals for which
documents were prepared, will be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made available will be
provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or at a fee which is not more than the actual cost of reproducing
copies required to be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ.


Processing and Use of Environmental Documents (Section 372.9)


This section would satisfy provisions of the CEQ regulations designed ``to ensure that decisions are made in accordance
with the policies and purposes of the Act'' (40 CFR 1505.1).
EA's will be forwarded immediately upon completion to the decisionmaker for a determination of whether the proposed
action may have significant effects on the human environment, and for the execution, as appropriate, of a finding
of no significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an EIS. At this time, the EA's will be made available consistent
with the notification provisions of  372.8 of these procedures.
Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker
who may then take appropriate action.
Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact which are prompted by comments, new information,
or any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the notice of availability (except that all commenters
will be mailed copies of changes directly) prior to implementing the proposed action or any alternative.
EIS's will be processed according to the CEQ regulations from inception (publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the notice of intent) to completion (publication of a final environmental impact statement or a supplement).
For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will be
part of the administrative record.
For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, the environmental record, including comments and responses,
will accompany proposals through the existing review process. The APHIS decisionmaking for each NEPA document will
consider the range of alternatives discussed in environmental documents in reaching their determinations on the
merits of proposed actions.


Supplementing Environmental Impact Statements (Section 372.10)


This section describes how supplemental EIS's are introduced into the administrative record.
The decision to prepare a supplemental EIS is similar to the decision to prepare an EIS in the first instance. As such,
that decision turns on a myriad of factors. But once a decision to supplement an EIS is made, a notice of intent will be
published in the 

Federal Register

, which in effect serves to reopen the administrative record. The supplemental document will then be processed in
the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a final statement, unless alternative procedures are approved
by CEQ.


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
These proposed procedures satisfy the requirement to implement CEQ's NEPA regulations and have been designed to
reduce to a minimum the regulatory burden on small entities and all other individuals and organizations, public and
private.
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of APHIS has determined that these procedures would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Executive Order 12372


This program/activity is listed in the catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V).


Executive Order 12778


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If these proposed procedures
are adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are in conflict with these procedures will be preempted;
(2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before
parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.


The National Environmental Policy Act


Section 372.5(b)(1) of these proposed procedures provides, in part, that an EA will normally be prepared for ``rulemaking
proposals that * * * may affect opportunities for the public, nongovernmental organizations, and
others to influence environmental planning and decisionmaking.'' See, 

Illinois Commerce Comm'n 

v. 

ICC, 

848 F.2d 1246, 1256 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (``it is not at all apparent that a change in procedure alone will not affect the
environment_the new procedure may, for example, lessen the opportunity for environmental groups to influence the
agency's final decision''). An environmental assessment, which examines opportunities for public involvement
in APHIS' environmental process, has been prepared. The environmental assessment concludes essentially that public
involvement in APHIS' environmental planning and decisionmaking is consistent with NEPA requirements. In the circumstances,
a finding of no significant impact is appropriate.
Copies of the environmental assessment may be obtained by writing the contact for this rulemaking provided under
the section heading 

For Further Information Contact.

 Comments are invited and should be submitted to this same contact on or before the comment due date for this proposed
rulemaking.


Paperwork Reduction Act


These proposed procedures contain no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

 372.4 

Definitions.



The terminology set forth in the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) implementing regulations at 40 CFR part
1508 is incorporated herein. In addition, the following terms as used in these procedures are defined as follows:




APHIS

. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 



Decisionmaker

. The agency official responsible for executing findings of no significant impact in the environmental assessment
process and the record of decision in the environmental impact statement process.



Department

. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).



Environmental unit.

 Environmental Analysis and Documentation, the analytical unit in the Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental
Protection responsible for coordinating APHIS' compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and other
environmental laws and regulations. 



 372.5 

Classification of actions.



(a) 

Actions normally requiring environmental impact statements. 

An environmental impact statement will normally be prepared for the following types of actions:

(1) Administrative procedures that seek to establish broad-scale, significant, impact-generating strategies,
methods, or techniques (e.g., treatment options of individual large-scale aerial application of chemicals) as
the means of dealing with pervasive animal and plant health issues within the purview of APHIS. Examples of this category
of actions include:

(i) Contingency or ``emergency'' response strategies (comprehensive in scope)_the design of which is intended
to provide solutions, generally on very short notice, thereby severely limiting subsequent consideration of alternatives
by planners and decisionmakers_to widespread outbreaks of animal and plant diseases or similar exigencies, and

(ii) Strategic or other long-range plans that purport to adopt for future application, in the context of extensive
APHIS programs, a preferred course of action having the potential for significant environmental impact.

(2) General administrative (programmatic) examination of APHIS strategies and options for dealing with issues
that have important implications for the maintenance and enhancement of environmental quality. An example of this
category of actions is:

(1) An administrative proceeding undertaken to rationalize, prioritize, and streamline_particularly from the
standpoint of competing policies (e.g., environmental policies and economic development)_essential activities
related to program mission and functions.

(b) 

Actions normally requiring environmental assessments. 

Classes of actions identified below, which normally do not have the potential to affect significantly the quality
of the human environment, will, for NEPA purposes, be evaluated in the context of environmental assessments.
(1) Policymaking and rulemaking proposals that involve program plans, techniques, methods, or other activities
likely to have a consequential effect on the physical or natural environment or that may affect opportunities for
the public, nongovernmental organizations, and others to influence environmental planning and decisionmaking.
(2) Development of program plans or similar nonexperimental approaches that seek to establish in more limited contexts
impact-generating strategies, methods, or techniques as the means of dealing with animal and plant health issues
within the purview of APHIS. Examples of this category of actions include:
(i) Proposals to remedy specific problems, including plant pest infestations, animal diseases, and depredating
animals; and 
(ii) Substantial APHIS involvement in the planning efforts of the USDA's Forest Service, the Department of the Interior's
Bureau of Land Management, States, and Indian Tribes to eradicate or control plant pests, animal disease, or depredating
animals.
(3) Site-specific implementation of action plans and approaches mentioned in paragraph (b)(2) of this section,
except where isolated activities, introductions, or applications, as developed more fully in the following subsection
entitled ``Categorically Excluded Actions,'' are contemplated.
(4) Planning, design, and construction or acquisition of major new facilities, or proposals for substantial modifications
to existing facilities.
(5) Disposition of laboratory waste and other hazardous or toxic materials, except as provided under paragraph (c)
of this section.
(6) Approval and issuance of permits for:
(i) The release into the environment of genetically engineered organisms and products; and 
(ii) The release into the environment of exotic organisms.
(7) Research or testing that:
(i) Will be conducted outside of a laboratory or other containment area (field trials, for example); or 
(ii) Reaches a stage of development (e.g., formulation of pre-marketing strategies) that forecasts an irretrievable
commitment to the resulting products or technology.
(c) 

Categorically excluded actions. 

The Department has promulgated categorical exclusions of actions that are applicable to all agencies whose procedures
do no provide otherwise. Those categorical exclusions, codified at 7 CFR 1b.3(a), are adopted as entirely appropriate
for APHIS. Other categories of APHIS actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect
on the human environment and for which neither environmental assessment nor environmental impact statements will
be prepared include:

(1)(i) Routine measures employed by the agency to pursue its mission and functions, such as identifications, inspections,
surveys, sampling, testing, seizures, quarantines, removals, sanitizing, inoculations, and monitoring, including
the use_according to any label instructions or other lawful requirements and consistent with standard, published
program practices and precautions_of chemicals, pesticides, or other potentially hazardous or harmful substances,
materials, and target-specific devices or remedies, provided that such use:
(A) Is localized in nonurban areas to individual parcels such as farms, ranches, or nurseries, or contained (and not
aerially applied or administered) in urbanized areas to discrete sites that do not cater to the general public, and
is limited in terms of quantity, i.e., low- or ultra-low volume or individualized dosages and remedies;
(B) Will not cause contaminants to enter water bodies, including wetlands;
(C) Does not adversely affect any federally protected species or critical habitat; and 
(D) Is not persistent in the environment and does not cause bioaccumulation.
(ii) 

All 

circumstances delineated in paragraph (c)(i) (A) through (D) of this section (insofar as they may pertain to a particular
action) must be affirmed for any such use to be categorically excluded from the NEPA process. Examples of this category
of actions include: 
(A) Inoculation of discrete herds of livestock, or wildlife treatment strategies undertaken in contained areas
(such as a zoo, an exhibition, or an aviary);
(B) Pesticide treatments applied to infested plants on a homesite without contamination of water; and 

(C) Isolated (for example, along a highway) weed control efforts.
(2) Activities that are carried out in laboratories, facilities, or other areas designed to eliminate the potential
for harmful environmental effects_internal or external_and to provide lawful waste disposal. Examples of this
category of actions include:
(i) The development and/or production (including formulation, repackaging, movement, and distribution) of approved
and/or licensed program material, devices, reagents, and biologics;

(ii) Research, testing, and development of animal repellents; and 
(iii) Development and production of sterile insects.
(3) Routine precautionary measures, including identifications, inspections, surveys, testing, inoculating,
and monitoring of a limited scope and intensity, designed to assure the proper care, protection, and treatment of
animals.
(4) Rehabilitation of existing laboratories and other APHIS facilities, functional replacement of parts and equipment,
and minor additions to such existing APHIS facilities.

<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) Agency actions, including the issuance of permits, authorization to ship, or licensing involving a category
of veterinary biological product which has been previously licensed, unless the product has been subsequently shown
to be unsafe, or will be used at substantially higher dosage levels or for substantially different applications or
circumstances than in the use for which the product was previously approved. Also, the issuance of a license, permit,
or authorization to ship for field testing products that had not been previously licensed that do not contain live
microorganisms or that are used only for in vitro diagnostic testing.

(d) 

Exceptions for categorically excluded actions.

 Whenever the decisionmaker determines that an action listed in paragraph (c) of this section may have the potential
to affect ``significantly'' the quality of the ``human environment,'' as those terms are defined at 40 CFR 1508.27
and 1508.14, respectively, an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment will be prepared.



 372.6 

Early planning for applicants and non-APHIS entities.



Each prospective applicant who anticipates the need for approval of proposed activities classified as normally
requiring environmental documentation is encouraged to contact, at the earliest opportunity, APHIS' program staff,
which will then coordinate with the environmental unit to design a streamlined compliance course tailored to the
needs of the particular proposal.



 372.7 

Consultation.



Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact APHIS program officials to determine what types of environmental
analyses or documentation, if any, need to be prepared. Early consultation is not intended to satisfy the requirements
of NEPA alone. NEPA documents will incorporate, to the fullest extent possible, surveys and studies required by other
environmental statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act.



 372.8 

Major planning and decision points and public involvement.



(a) 

Major planning and decision points.

 The NEPA process will be fully coordinated with APHIS planning by APHIS' environmental unit in cooperation with program
personnel. Specific decision points or milestones will be identified and communicated to the public and others in
a notice of intent and in the context of the public scoping process.

(b) 

Public involvement.

 There will be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed during environmental analysis.

(1) A notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as it is determined that a proposed major Federal action has the potential to affect significantly the quality
of the human environment. The notice may include a preliminary scope of environmental study. All public and other
involvement in APHIS' environmental impact statement process, including the scoping process, commenting on draft
documents, and participation in the preparation of any supplemental documents, will be pursuant to CEQ's implementing
regulations.

(2) Early public and other agency involvement in the environmental assessment process will be invited through announcements
made available in the same fashion as the environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact.

(3) Notification of the availability of environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact for proposed
activities will be published in the 

Federal Register

, unless it is determined that the effects of the action are primarily of local concern. Where the effects of the action
are primarily of local concern, notice will normally be provided through publication in a local or area newspaper
of general circulation and/or the procedures implementing Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review
of Federal Programs.''

(4) All environmental documents, comments received, and any underlying documents, including interagency correspondence
where such correspondence transmits comments of Federal agencies on the environmental impact of proposals for which
documents were prepared, will be made available to the public upon request. Materials to be made available will be
provided without charge, to the extent practicable, or at a fee which is not more than the actual cost of reproducing
copies required to be sent to other Federal agencies, including CEQ.



 372.9 

Processing and use of environmental documents.



(a) Environmental assessments will be forwarded immediately upon completion to the decisionmaker for a determination
of whether the proposed action may have significant effects on the quality of the human environment, and for the execution,
as appropriate, of a finding of no significant impact or a notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.
Simultaneously, the availability of environmental assessments will be announced by publishing a notice consistent
with the notification provisions of  372.8.

(b) Comments, if any, will be transmitted, together with any analyses and recommendations, to the APHIS decisionmaker
who may then take appropriate action.

(c) Changes to environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact which are prompted by comments, new
information, or any other source, will normally be announced in the same manner as the notice of availability (except
that all commenters will be mailed copies of changes directly) prior to implementing the proposed action or any alternative.

(d) Environmental impact statements will be processed from inception (publication of the notice of intent) to completion
(publication of a final environmental impact statement or a supplement) according to the Council on Environmental
Quality implementing regulations.

(e) For rulemaking or adjudicatory proceedings, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses will
be a part of the administrative record.

(f) For all APHIS activity that is subject to the NEPA process, relevant environmental documents, comments, and responses
will accompany proposals through the review process.

(g) The APHIS decisionmaker for each NEPA document will consider the range of alternatives discussed in environmental
documents in reaching their determinations on the merits of proposed actions.



 372.10 

Supplementing environmental impact statements.



Once a decision to supplement an environmental impact statement is made, a notice of intent will be published. The
administrative record will thereafter be open. The supplemental document will then be processed in the same fashion
(exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a final statement, unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ, and will
become part of the administrative record.

Kentucky Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing the receipt of a proposed amendment to the Kentucky Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Plan
(hereinafter referred to as the Kentucky plan) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The amendment deletes reference to the Kentucky Advisory Committee for Abandoned land Reclamation and establishes
informal procedures for coordination of activities with the Rural Abandoned Mine Program (RAMP) administered by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS). The amendment is intended to improve operational
efficiency.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background on the Kentucky Plan



Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources
adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal.
As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned
or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation
responsibility under State or Federal law. The Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-508,
Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective October 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231 

et seq

., to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation
of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond
forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977,
and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the
bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR program has the responsibility and primary authority
to implement the program.

On May 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Kentucky plan. Background information on the plan including
the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments and a detailed explanation of approval can be found in the May
18, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 21435). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at
30 CFR 917.21.

The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a state may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures in 30 CFR 884.14 when
approving or disapproving an amendment or revision.



II. Discussion of Proposed Amendment



By letter dated May 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. K-64), Kentucky submitted a proposed amendment to revise
procedures for coordinating with the RAMP, Indian, and other reclamation programs contained in Chapter 5 of the Kentucky
Plan. This amendment was initiated in part due to a finding by the Kentucky Auditor of Public Accounts in the Statewide
Audit for the period ended June 30, 1992, that the Division of Abandoned lands (DAL) was not operating in compliance
with the Kentucky Plan. Chapter 5 of the plan establishes a ``Kentucky Advisory Committee for Abandoned Mine Land
Reclamation'' to facilitate coordination of program activities with the RAMP program administered by the SCS. The
Auditor determined that the processes established for the Advisory Committee to coordinate with RAMP were not being
followed. The Advisory Committee had proven difficult to assemble, was cumbersome in operation, and had been disbanded.
The proposed AMLR program amendment describes new, more informal coordination procedures. The annual meeting of
the Kentucky Advisory Committee is to be replaced with an informal annual meeting between DAL and SCS staffs. During
the annual meeting, SCS will present overall RAMP plans and goals, including scheduled reclamation sites, and results
of past reclamation with emphasis on experience with various reclamation techniques. DAL will provide the SCS with
its project proposals through the Kentucky State Clearinghouse process. SCS will provide DAL with copies of RAMP
documentation provided to OSM. Contacts between DAL and RAMP staff management will be initiated by either party on
an as needed basis.

III. Public Comment Procedures


In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 884.14 and 884.15(a), OSM is seeking comment on whether the proposed amendment
satisfies the applicable plan approval criteria of 30 CFR 884.14. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become
part of the Kentucky plan.


Written Comments


Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commentor's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES 

or at locations other than the Lexington Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or
included in the Administrative Record.


Public Hearing


Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

by 4:00 p.m., E.D.T., on June 20, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to speak at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions.
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those scheduled.
The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to speak have
been heard.


Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendments may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

. All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES

. A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal
abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific
State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions on proposed State AMLR plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are based
on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231-1243)
and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State AMLR plans and
revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C.
4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).


Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

).


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis
was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for
the corresponding Federal regulations.

Background and Purpose



On March 12, 1994, the sponsor, Boys Harbor, Inc., New York, NY requested that a fireworks display be permitted in the
port of East Hampton in the vicinity of Sammy's Beach, East Hampton, NY from 8:45 p.m. through 10 p.m. on July 16, 1994.
The safety zone covers all waters of Three Mile Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barges FBG 1 and FBG
2, which will be tied together and located one mile south of Sammy's Beach, East Hampton, NY. This zone is required to
protect the maritime community from the dangers and potential hazards to navigation associated with this fireworks
display which is occurring over Three Mile Harbor. Entry into or movement within this zone is prohibited unless authorized
by the Captain of the Port or his on scene representative. Good cause exists for providing a comment period of less than
sixty days. Providing a sixty day comment period would be contrary to the public interest since the fireworks display
is for public viewing and is scheduled to occur in conjunction with the Boys Harbor, Inc. summer fund-raiser to benefit
disadvantaged boys from New York City.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.

The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be minimal due to the limited duration of the fireworks display, the
small size of the safety zone, the low level or non existent commercial vessel traffic expected in the area during the
effective time of the zone, and the broadcast of marine safety advisories the day of the event.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

Importation of Exotic Wild Birds to the United States; Amendment of Final Rule Implementing the Wild Bird Conservation
Act of 1992


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



Action:

 
Proposed rule. 




Summary: 

On October 23, 1992 the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include promoting
the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are
biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane
treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries
of origin. This proposal amends the final rule published by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) on November 16,
1993 in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60524), which implements the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provides permit requirements and procedures
for some allowed exemptions. As a result of a lawsuit filed on February 15, 1994 by the Humane Society of the United States
and Defenders of Wildlife, and a resultant District Court Order that a portion of the contested regulation is invalid,
the Service hereby proposes to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c). Notice of the Court Order was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 24, 1994. Consistent with that Court Order, the Service announced in that 

Federal Register

 notice that all exotic birds listed Appendix III of The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin.

 
</AGENCY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule proposes to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c)_Prohibitions, of the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

, November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60524).

In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that Appendix III species are considered CITES-listed
species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in Appendix III.
The Service noted that the listing of a species in Appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby
requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permit issuance requirements for that country only; when the
species is found in countries that did not list it in Appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating
that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in Appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found
in countries other than where listed in Appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed
is only listed in the Appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its
understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby Appendix III species were subject
to the 

automatic

 import prohibitions of the law, if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would be subject to the


discretionary

 prohibitions of the law. 
The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife brought a civil action against the Secretary of the
Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging that part of 50 CFR 15.11 which
restricts the importation of certain Appendix III exotic birds. 

Humane Society of the United States 

v. 

Babbitt, 

Civ. No. 94-0296 (D.D.C., March 29, 1994). A hearing in the District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs
argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained
in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph
(b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in Appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that
has not listed the species in Appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11(b)(2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates
the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.

On March 29, 1994 U. S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. (This Court
Order was discussed in a Notice in the 

Federal Register

 published on May 24, 1994.) Therefore, the Service hereby proposes to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) to comply with the
Court Order. The Service proposes that all bird species listed in CITES Appendix III, (in addition to those in Appendices
I or II) wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless they are either accompanied by an import permit issued
pursuant to subpart C of 50 CFR part 15, or they are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994 the Service published
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule that would establish those approved lists. 


Effects of the Rule 


The Service has determined that this proposed rule is categorically excluded under Departmental procedures in complying
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See DOI Departmental Manual, 516 DM 2, Appendix 1,   1.10.
The regulations are procedural in nature, and the environmental effects are judged to be minimal, speculative, and
do not lend themselves to meaningful analysis. The permits and other administrative actions authorized under the
WBCA and regulations will be subject to future NEPA documentation requirements, on a case-by-case basis. 


Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12630 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been determined not to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. This action would
not be expected to have significant taking implications for U.S. citizens, as per Executive Order 12630. Any effects
on small entities (importers, shippers, etc.) would likely be minor, and would in any event, be the mandatory result
of the district court ruling. Future proposed rule making will establish procedures for listing of species approved
for import, which may reduce any effects on small entities. No reporting requirements would be added to existing regulations.
Therefore, this revision would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as
described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Since the proposed rule applies to importation of live exotic birds
into the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. The Department
has certified that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive
Order 12778. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


No new information collection requirement(s) are contained in this proposed rule for which OMB approval under 44
U.S.C. 3501 is necessary.

Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska

AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would implement a moratorium for a temporary period on the entry of new vessels into the groundfish,
crab, and halibut fisheries contained in proposed Amendment 23 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish
Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI), proposed Amendment 28 to the FMP for Groundfish
of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), proposed Amendment 4 to the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area, and a proposed regulatory amendment affecting the Pacific halibut fishery
in the waters in and off of Alaska. The moratorium is designed as a temporary measure that is necessary to curtail increases
in fishing capacity and provide industry stability while the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)
and the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) prepare, review, and, if approved, implement a comprehensive management
plan for these fisheries. This action is intended to promote the objectives of the Council to promote conservation
and management of groundfish, crab, and halibut resources, and to further the objectives of the Northern Pacific
Halibut Act of 1982 (Halibut Act) and the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the GOA and the BSAI are managed by the Secretary
under the GOA and BSAI FMPs. The commercial harvest of king and Tanner crabs is managed under the FMP for the Commercial
King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area. These FMPs were prepared by the Council
under the Magnuson Act. The FMP for the GOA groundfish fisheries is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR parts 672 and
676, and the FMP for the BSAI groundfish fisheries is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR parts 675 and 676. The FMP
for the king and Tanner crab fisheries in the BSAI is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 671 and by Alaska Administrative
Code regulations at title 5, chapters 34 and 35. For crab, BSAI means the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area as defined
at  671.2, and is a slightly different area than the BSAI management area as defined for groundfish at  675.2.
General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. groundfish and crab fisheries are set out at 
50 CFR part 620. 
The Council does not have a FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and off of Alaska is managed by the International
Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), signed at Washington, DC, March
29, 1979, and the Halibut Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the respective Regional Fishery Management
Councils established by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with,
regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop
for approval by the Secretary limited access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery in Convention waters in and
off of Alaska. ``Convention waters'' means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United States and Canada as
described in Article I of the Convention (see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). The Council acted under this authority in recommending
its proposed moratorium for the halibut fishery. Regulations governing the harvesting of Pacific halibut are set
out at 50 CFR parts 301 and 676. 
In 1987, amid growing indications of excess harvesting capacity in the North Pacific groundfish fisheries, the Council
adopted a ``statement of commitment'' to pursue alternative management measures that would achieve optimum yield
through more rational fishing effort than exists with the current open access system. The Council identified ways
to fulfill this commitment that included the development of an alternative management strategy for groundfish fisheries
and the consideration of effort management in the crab and halibut fisheries. 
Fishery management planning work continued in 1987 with the formation of the Future of Groundfish (FOG) Committee.
The FOG Committee undertook a comprehensive examination of the groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries off of Alaska.
It concluded that problems of excess harvesting capacity and allocation conflicts would worsen under a continued
open access system. The committee recommended a limited access management approach for these three fisheries. 
In 1989 and 1990, the Council considered methods for implementing a moratorium that would limit access of new vessels
into the groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries. At its meeting in August 1990, the Council recommended that NMFS
publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to: a. Inform the public of the Council's intention to develop measures to limit access; and b. announce a control date
after which owners of vessels that had not previously participated would not be assured future access to these fisheries
if a limited access system were implemented using that control date. The control date notice was published on September
5, 1990 (55 FR 36302), corrected on September 13, 1990 (55 FR 37729), and announced September 15, 1990, as the control
date.

The control date notice stated that ``due consideration'' would be given to vessels that were under construction
or under contract for purchase or construction and that had harvested or processed groundfish, crab, or halibut by
January 15, 1992. In response to the delay of the 1992 trawl groundfish season from January 1, 1992, until January 20,
1992, the Council decided at its September 1991 meeting to change the final ``due consideration'' date to February
9, 1992. 
The control date notice indicated that the Council was examining a change in the current open-access nature of the
groundfish, crab, and halibut fisheries as part of a long-term solution to chronic conservation and management problems.
The Council is continuing its study of long-term solutions to problems in these fisheries in its comprehensive management
plan. 
The moratorium is not expected to resolve the problem of excess capacity. However, the Council considers it necessary
as an interim management measure to curtail increases in fishing capacity and provide temporary industry stability.
While the moratorium is in effect, the Council can prepare and the Secretary can review and, if approved, implement
a comprehensive management plan. The Council also determined that the moratorium would aid in the achievement of
optimum yield by freezing the number of vessels allowed to participate in these fisheries and limiting increases
in fishing capacity, both of which would increase economic benefits to fishermen and reduce the risk of overfishing.



Vessel Moratorium Program 


The following section provides a summary of the provisions included in the motion, clarifications, and the Council's
rationale for selecting those provisions. The subsequent section, ``Implementation of the Moratorium,'' explains
how the moratorium would be implemented if approved by the Secretary and includes changes proposed by NMFS to supplement
the Council's proposed moratorium. The Council adopted a moratorium by approving a motion at its June 1992 meeting,
with clarification in August 1992 and January 1993. 
Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act, as amended, requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by
a Council within 15 days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined
that the FMP amendments these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions
of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making final determinations, will take into account
the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. 


Provisions Contained in the Council's Motions 


1. Moratorium Fisheries


The proposed moratorium fisheries would be: a. All groundfish fisheries managed under the GOA FMP; b. all groundfish
fisheries managed under the BSAI FMP; c. all crab fisheries managed under the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner
Crab Fisheries in the BSAI; and d. the commercial Pacific halibut fishery conducted in the waters in and off of the State
of Alaska (State). 


2. Affected Sectors of the Industry


The moratorium would apply only to catcher vessels and catcher-processor vessels participating in one or more of
the moratorium fisheries. The Council designed the moratorium to stem the growth in harvesting capacity. It determined
that restricting motherships, tendering vessels, and other support vessels would not accomplish this goal. 


3. Qualifying Period


A vessel could be used to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries during the moratorium, if a reported landing
in one of the moratorium fisheries was made from that vessel between January 1, 1980, and February 9, 1992. Such a vessel
would be called a ``qualifying vessel.'' 
The Council determined that a date earlier than January 1, 1980, would have increased the size of the fleet eligible
to participate during the moratorium period and placed a greater weight on past participation. A date later than January
1, 1980, would have restricted the size of the fleet eligible to participate during the moratorium period only to current
or very recent participants. 
The Council selected February 9, 1992, as the ending date for the qualifying period instead of the announced control
date of September 15, 1990, with its ``due consideration'' requirements. Determining which vessels should be allowed
to participate during the moratorium under ``due consideration'' would have required extensive review of documents
submitted by the vessel owners and investigation as to whether the documents proved that vessels were qualifying
vessels under the ``due consideration'' criteria. The Council deemed the submission and review of documents as too
burdensome and expensive to implement. By selecting February 9, 1992, the Council included all vessels that were
under ``due consideration'' without having to make any findings concerning construction or vessels under contract.

The qualifying period adopted by the Council would allow approximately 13,500 vessels to be eligible to participate
in the moratorium fisheries during the moratorium. Substantially fewer vessels participate in any one year. In 1991,
only about 4,500 vessels participated in the moratorium fisheries. NMFS particularly requests public comment on
the effect of this qualifying period on the objectives of the moratorium. 


4. Minimum Qualifying Poundage


The Council did not require landing of a specific minimum poundage from a moratorium fishery. A qualifying vessel
would be one that made a reported landing from a moratorium fishery during the qualifying period. The Council reasoned
that basing moratorium eligibility on landing a minimum amount from a moratorium fishery would become allocative
among different segments of the industry and should be addressed in the comprehensive management plan. 


5. Duration of Moratorium


The moratorium would be in effect for no longer than 3 years from the date of implementation. The proposed FMP amendment
language states that the Council may extend the moratorium for up to 2 years if a permanent limited access program is
imminent. This provides flexibility in the duration of the moratorium if progress is made on a permanent limited access
program, but does not unnecessarily prolong the moratorium in the absence of further progress on the underlying overcapitalization
problem. If no further action is taken concerning a limited access program during the moratorium, the moratorium
would expire, because its justification would no longer be valid.

6. Crossovers



The Council determined that a qualifying vessel would be allowed to participate in all moratorium fisheries during
the moratorium, even if the vessel had a reported landing from only one moratorium fishery. The Council reasoned that
restrictions on the ability to crossover into other moratorium fisheries would constrain a fisherman's flexibility
during the moratorium and would be allocative among different sectors of the industry. The Council determined that
crossover restrictions would be addressed under the comprehensive management plan. 

Crossovers during the moratorium could result in the entry of groundfish and halibut vessels into the crab fisheries,
halibut vessels into the groundfish fisheries, and crab pot vessels into the groundfish fisheries. NMFS particularly
requests public comment on crossovers, because crossover ability could have the potential to increase the harvesting
capacity in the groundfish and crab fisheries, thwarting the goals of the moratorium. 



7. Transfer of Moratorium Qualification



``Moratorium qualification'' is proposed for all qualifying vessels. Moratorium qualification could be transferred
if two requirements were satisfied. First, the vessel transferring moratorium qualification would no longer be
eligible to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries for the remainder of the moratorium unless that vessel
subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification from another vessel. Second, if moratorium qualification
were transferred to another vessel, a vessel length restriction would apply to the receiving vessel. The latter restriction,
known as the ``20 percent rule'', would restrict vessels that are equal to, or less than, 125 ft (38.1 m) length overall
(LOA) from increasing LOA by more than 20 percent, or 125 ft (38.1 m), whichever is less. Vessels over 125 ft (38.1 m)
LOA would not be allowed to increase LOA during the moratorium. The LOA of a vessel, as defined at   672.2
and 675.2, means the horizontal distance, rounded to the nearest foot (.33 m) between the foremost part of the stem
and the aftermost part of the stern, excluding bowsprits, rudders, outboard motor brackets, and similar fittings
or attachments. For example, the owner of a vessel that is 100 ft (30.5 m) LOA could transfer that vessel's moratorium
qualification to a vessel that is 120 ft (36.6 m) LOA or less. The 100-ft (30.5 m) LOA vessel would not be able to participate
in any of the moratorium fisheries for the duration of the moratorium because it does not have moratorium qualification.
The 100-ft (30.5 m) vessel would be able to participate if it received transferred moratorium qualification from
a vessel that was 83 ft (25.3 m) LOA or longer. 

The Council did not select a date before which the transfer of moratorium qualification would not be allowed. Recognizing
that a market in moratorium qualification had developed, the Council determined that moratorium qualification
would rest with the qualifying vessel unless otherwise specified by legal agreement. The Council also determined
that the transfer of moratorium qualification would not result in a transfer of the vessel's catch history. 



8. Replacement of Vessel



Until the moratorium expires, the owner of a vessel with moratorium qualification would be able to replace that vessel
with a vessel that does not have moratorium qualification as long as two requirements were satisfied. First, the replaced
vessel would no longer be eligible to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries for the remainder of the moratorium,
unless that vessel subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification from another vessel. Second, any
increase in LOA through vessel replacement, sequential vessel replacements, or combined replacement and reconstruction
would be limited by the 20 percent rule. The Council deemed the vessel replacement provision as necessary to facilitate
the normal and on-going vessel replacement activities undertaken by vessel owners in response to financial, economic,
and efficiency incentives. 



9. Reconstruction of Vessel


A qualifying vessel that is reconstructed would have to comply with certain restrictions in LOA to remain eligible
to participate in any of the moratorium fisheries. The proposed restrictions are: a. If vessel reconstruction were
completed before June 24, 1992, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would be unrestricted; additional
reconstruction would be allowed after June 24, 1992, subject to the 20 percent rule. b. If reconstruction were started
before June 24, 1992, but not completed by that date, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would
be unrestricted, but no more increases in LOA would be allowed during the moratorium. c. If reconstruction were started
on or after June 24, 1992, any increase in LOA resulting from that reconstruction would be subject to the 20 percent
rule. 

The Council determined that it was important to allow increases in vessel LOA through reconstruction to provide for
enhanced safety and stability, or to allow for the installation of processing equipment. However, the Council determined
that reconstruction should not allow unlimited increases in LOA or the objectives of the moratorium would be compromised.
The Council chose to limit LOA as a measure of fishing capacity, because it believed LOA was unambiguous, easily determined,
and difficult to circumvent. To account equitably for actions already taken by vessel owners, restrictions on increases
in LOA would be applicable only to changes that occurred after June 24, 1992, which was the day the Council adopted the
20 percent rule and the public became aware of this Council action through the June 24th Council meeting. 



10. Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Vessel



Any qualifying vessel that is lost or destroyed during the moratorium could be replaced by a non-qualifying vessel.
Any qualifying vessel that was lost or destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, until the date of moratorium implementation
could be replaced with a non-qualifying vessel. However, the replacement vessel would be required to make a landing
from a moratorium fishery within 2 years of the moratorium implementation date. A qualifying vessel lost or destroyed
before January 1, 1989, could not be replaced. A vessel that replaced a lost or destroyed vessel would be subject to
the 20 percent rule, and the replaced vessel would become a non-qualifying vessel unless that vessel subsequently
received transferred moratorium qualification.

<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Council included this provision to make allowance for a vessel lost or destroyed before and during the moratorium.
The January 1, 1989, date was selected because the Council determined that an owner of a vessel lost or destroyed prior
to 1989 is likely to have received insurance claims, and already obtained a replacement vessel. 



11. Salvage of Lost or Destroyed Vessel



A qualifying vessel that was lost or destroyed on or after January 1, 1989, may be salvaged and remain a qualifying vessel.
The Council chose this date because the owner of a vessel lost or destroyed prior to 1989 is likely to have received insurance
claims, and already have obtained a replacement vessel. 

However, the Council created an exception for a qualifying vessel that was lost or destroyed before January 1, 1989.
It could be salvaged and remain moratorium eligible if: a. The salvage operations began by June 24, 1992; and b. the
salvaged vessel makes a landing from a moratorium fishery within 2 years of the date of implementation of the moratorium.


The provision to allow the salvage of a vessel before January 1, 1989, was added at the Council's August 1992 meeting
based on public testimony received at that meeting. The Council chose June 24, 1992, because that was the date the Council
approved the motion on the moratorium. The Council required such a salvaged vessel to make a landing within 2 years
of the moratorium implementation date to ensure that the vessel was participating in a moratorium fishery. 



12. Exemptions to the Moratorium



The Council included three exemptions to the moratorium. First, a vessel that participates in moratorium fisheries
in the GOA that does not exceed 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA, and a vessel that participates in moratorium fisheries in the BSAI that
does not exceed 32 ft 
(9.8 m) LOA would be exempt, providing such vessel lengths are not increased beyond these LOA limits. The Council provided
these exemptions because, according to the EA/RIR/IRFA, vessels less than 36 ft (11 m) LOA in the BSAI and GOA were responsible
for less than 1 percent of the moratorium fisheries landings and comprised approximately 65 percent of the fleet of
qualified vessels in 1991. Eliminating the smaller vessels from the moratorium would lessen the burden on small vessel
owners, while not compromising the goals of the moratorium. The limit was set at 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA or less in the GOA because
vessels of this size represent the typical skiff fleet. In the BSAI, 32 ft (9.8 m) LOA represents the historical length
restriction imposed on vessels participating in the Bristol Bay drift gillnet salmon fishery. 

Second, a newly constructed vessel that was constructed pursuant to an approved Community Development Plan (CDP)
under provisions of 50 CFR parts 675 and 676 would be exempted if: 
a. It were constructed solely for the purpose of furthering the goals of a CDP; b. it were a specialized vessel designed
and equipped to meet the needs of a community or group of communities that have specific and unique operating requirements;
and c. it were 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or less. Such a vessel could participate in Community Development Quota (CDQ) and non-CDQ
fisheries during the moratorium subject to other regulatory provisions. Such a vessel would lose its exempt status
and would be restricted from participating in any of the moratorium fisheries, if it were transferred to a non-CDQ
entity during the moratorium, unless the vessel subsequently received transferred moratorium qualification.


Third, a halibut or sablefish fixed gear vessel operating under the provisions of the Individual Fishery Quota (IFQ)
program would be exempted from the vessel moratorium, as it affects directed halibut and sablefish operations. The
Secretary approved the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish fixed gear fishery on January 29, 1993 (58 FR 59375,
November 9, 1993). A non-qualifying vessel that is harvesting IFQ halibut or sablefish would not be able to participate
in any other directed moratorium fishery, but would be permitted to retain moratorium species other than halibut
and sablefish in amounts up to 20 percent of the amount of halibut and sablefish on board. 



13. Appeals



The Council's preferred alternative provides for an administrative appeal of an initial denial of a vessel permit
or license. The intent of the Council, in recommending the opportunity for an administrative appeal, was to allow
for an administrative solution to contested eligibility without the expense of a court proceeding. The Council determined
that most appeals under the moratorium would be resolved through the examination of records. In the event that review
of an appeal would require more than a review of the records and application of the regulations and would benefit from
industry expertise, the Council recommended establishment of an adjudication or appeals board to review the appeals.




Implementation of the Moratorium 



If approved by the Secretary, the moratorium would be effective for 3 years from its implementation date, as recommended
by the Council. If approved, NMFS intends to implement the moratorium on January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997.




Permit Requirements 



Under the moratorium, NMFS is proposing that only a vessel that is issued a permit would be able to participate in the
moratorium fisheries. Currently, an owner of a vessel harvesting halibut in the waters in and off of Alaska must obtain
a vessel license from the IPHC, a groundfish harvesting, processing or support vessel in Federal waters off of Alaska
must obtain a vessel permit from NMFS, and a king or Tanner crab harvesting, processing, or support vessel in Federal
and State waters must obtain a vessel permit from the State. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the moratorium, a vessel owner would continue to apply to the IPHC for a halibut vessel license, and to NMFS for
a groundfish vessel permit. Since the State does not have authority to impose a moratorium on vessels, NMFS also would
require a crab harvesting, processing, or support vessel participating in the crab fisheries in the Federal waters
of the BSAI to obtain a Federal vessel permit. The State would continue to require a State vessel permit to participate
in crab fisheries in State waters, and the FMP for the Commercial King and Tanner Crab Fisheries in the BSAI would continue
to defer much of the management of the fishery to the State. 

An owner of a support vessel that intends to participate in the moratorium fisheries from January 1, 1995, through
December 31, 1997, would have to apply for and receive a permit, but would not be subject to the moratorium eligibility
requirements. 

Permits and licenses issued under the moratorium would remain harvesting privileges and the Secretary would have
the authority to amend or revoke the moratorium and any harvesting privileges thereunder, if required for conservation
of the resources. 



Eligibility Requirements 



As previously discussed, a vessel would be eligible to receive a permit or license if it has moratorium qualification
and if its LOA does not exceed the applicable length restrictions. NMFS is proposing to implement the Council's length
increase restrictions, or the 20 percent rule, by requiring the LOA of a vessel to be no greater than 1.2 times the ``original
qualifying length'' of the qualifying vessel. This calculation results in a ``maximum LOA'' that the vessel may not
exceed during the moratorium. The original qualifying length would be the registered length of a qualifying vessel
that appears on the most recently submitted application prior to June 24, 1992, for U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of
Documentation, or State documentation if the vessel is not required to have U.S. Coast Guard Documentation. For vessels
with an original qualifying length of less than or equal to 104 ft (31.7 m), the maximum LOA would be 1.2 times the original
qualifying length. For vessels with an original qualifying length greater than 104 ft (31.7 m) but less than or equal
to 125 ft (38.1 m), the maximum LOA would be 125 ft (38.1 m). For vessels with an original qualifying length greater than
125 ft (38.1 m), the maximum LOA would be the original qualifying length. Vessels that satisfy both moratorium conditions
would be ``eligible vessels.'' 



Vessel Reconstruction 



Vessel reconstruction means an adjustment in the LOA of a qualifying vessel. NMFS proposes that the maximum LOA for
a qualifying vessel that is 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or less could be adjusted through reconstruction and the vessel would
remain an eligible vessel under the following three conditions. First, if vessel reconstruction were completed
on or before June 24, 1992, the LOA of the reconstructed vessel would become the new original qualifying length of the
vessel. The new original qualifying length then would be used to calculate maximum LOA as described above under ``Eligibility
Requirements.'' Second, if vessel reconstruction were started before June 24, 1992, but not finished by that date,
the LOA of the reconstructed vessel would become the new maximum LOA for the vessel. No further increase in LOA would
be permitted during the moratorium. Third, if vessel reconstruction were started on or after June 24, 1992, the maximum
LOA would not be adjusted during the moratorium, and any increases in LOA as a result of reconstruction would have to
be less than or equal to the maximum LOA for the vessel. Vessel reconstruction would begin and end with the start and
completion of the physical modification of the vessel. The determination of any adjustment in maximum LOA for reconstructed
vessels would have to be approved by NMFS and be based on documentation supplied to NMFS that verifies the beginning
and ending dates of vessel reconstruction. NMFS proposes that acceptable documentation of the beginning and ending
dates of reconstruction would be limited to a notarized affidavit signed by the vessel owner and the owner/manager
of the shipyard that specifies the beginning and ending dates of the reconstruction. NMFS particularly requests
comments from the public on this proposed method for documenting the beginning and ending dates of vessel reconstruction.




Transfer of Moratorium Qualification 



Moratorium qualification would be transferable from a vessel to another vessel or person, or from a person to another
person or vessel. Any transfer of moratorium qualification by a vessel would make that vessel ineligible. For the
purposes of implementing the moratorium, vessel replacement would be considered a transferral of moratorium qualification.
Additionally, to establish transfer of moratorium qualification by legal agreement, NMFS proposes that a written
contract must exist that documents the transfer and includes certain information as proposed in  676.3(b)(1)(i).



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NMFS would determine the maximum LOA for each qualifying vessel prior to the implementation of the moratorium. When
the moratorium qualification of a qualifying vessel is transferred to another vessel or person, the maximum LOA of
the qualifying vessel also would be transferred to the vessel or person receiving the moratorium qualification.
Maximum LOA would remain attached to a specific moratorium qualification regardless of how many times that moratorium
qualification was transferred. If moratorium qualification is transferred to a smaller vessel, that smaller vessel
would retain the maximum LOA of the qualifying vessel. 



Definition of Vessel Length 



The Council intended that the limitations on increases in vessel length be based on the LOA of the vessel. The current
LOA of a vessel can be measured as it is defined in   672.2 and 675.2, but complete records of the historical
LOA of vessels during the qualifying period are not available for calculating the maximum LOA as proposed by NMFS.
Various methods for measuring vessel length were used on vessel permit and license forms during the qualifying period
by NMFS, the State, IPHC, and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG). For example, several different methods of measuring ``registered
length'' were used, and an undefined vessel ``length'' was used in addition to LOA. NMFS proposes, for purposes of
the moratorium, that historical LOA equal the registered length listed on the most recently submitted application
prior to June 24, 1992, for U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Documentation to provide a single source of data for most
original qualifying vessels. A vessel under 32 ft 
(9.8 m) LOA that does not have USCG documentation may use vessel length as specified in State registration. 

A difficulty with the NMFS proposal is that the USCG registered length is sometimes less than actual LOA. This may cause
a problem for a vessel that already has increased its length using actual historical LOA according to the Council's
recommendations, resulting in an increase that exceeds the maximum LOA. Consequently, the vessel would be an ineligible
vessel. Also, a vessel that has not yet increased its length according to the Council's 20 percent limit would not be
able to increase its length as much as would be allowed if historical LOA were used instead of historical registered
length. NMFS particularly requests comment from the public on this subject. 



Replacement or Salvage of a Lost or Destroyed Vessel 



If a vessel owner submits an application to NMFS for the replacement or salvage of a lost or destroyed vessel, NMFS proposes
to determine whether a vessel is lost or destroyed by consulting the U.S. Coast Guard Report of Marine Casualty, form
2692. If NMFS determines that a vessel is lost or destroyed, a vessel owner would then be required to submit documentation
that satisfies the Council's requirements for eligibility of a replacement or salvaged vessel. These proposed information
requirements are specified in  676.3(b)(3)(iii). 



Permit Issuance Procedure 



For purposes of the moratorium, NMFS would prepare a database that contains each vessel that made a qualifying landing
during the qualifying period. The database also would include information concerning ownership and vessel length
derived from permit and license data. The database would be used by NMFS for determining eligible vessels. NMFS proposes
the following vessel permit and license issuance procedure. 



Groundfish



A vessel owner that intends to harvest groundfish in the GOA and BSAI from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997,
would have to submit to the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), a written application for a groundfish
vessel permit. An applicant would be issued a permit if: a. The vessel owner submitted a completed vessel permit application;
b. the vessel made a qualifying landing during the qualifying period or submitted a completed moratorium qualification
transfer application with the vessel permit application; and c. the LOA of the vessel did not exceed the maximum LOA
for that vessel. If the vessel reconstruction provisions at  676.3(b)(2) apply, a vessel owner also should
submit a completed vessel reconstruction application with the vessel permit application. All permits issued by
NMFS would list the maximum LOA applicable for that vessel and for any vessel to which the moratorium qualification
is transferred.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If a vessel owner applies to NMFS for a groundfish vessel permit, and NMFS determines that the vessel is an ineligible
vessel, the vessel owner would be notified in writing by NMFS that a vessel permit would not be issued. The applicant
could appeal the initial decision within 45 days of issuance of the written notification according to the appeal procedures
described below. Although each GOA and BSAI groundfish vessel would have to apply for and obtain a vessel permit from
NMFS, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels would be required to be eligible vessels. 



Crab



A vessel owner that intends to fish for king and Tanner crab in the Federal waters of the BSAI from January 1, 1995, through
December 31, 1997, would have to submit to the Regional Director a written application for a Federal crab vessel permit
in addition to any permit required by the State. The application and issuance procedure, and the appeals procedure
for crab vessel permits would be the same as for groundfish. Although all vessels operating in crab fisheries in the
BSAI would have to apply for and obtain a vessel permit from NMFS, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels
would be required to be eligible vessels. 



Halibut



A vessel owner that intends to harvest halibut from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997, in the waters in and
off Alaska would have to apply for a vessel license from the IPHC. Upon receipt of a written vessel license application,
the IPHC would compare the information submitted by the applicant with the NMFS database of eligible vessels. An unrestricted
vessel license would be issued if: a. The vessel owner were to submit a completed vessel license application to the
IPHC; 
b. the vessel made a qualifying landing during the qualifying period; and c. the LOA of the vessel did not exceed the
maximum LOA. Each unrestricted vessel license issued by the IPHC would list the maximum LOA applicable for the vessel
and for any vessel to which the moratorium qualification is transferred. 

If a vessel owner applies to the IPHC for a halibut vessel license but the information on the application does not correspond
to the information in the NMFS database, the IPHC would issue a restricted vessel license, applicable only for IPHC
management areas 2A or 2B which are in and off British Columbia, Canada, and the States of California, Oregon, and Washington.
At this point, the vessel owner would have the option of submitting additional written information regarding eligibility
to NMFS within 45 days of issuance of the restricted vessel license. NMFS would review the additional information
and issue a written decision as to whether an unrestricted halibut license would be issued. If NMFS initially determines
that the vessel is eligible, NMFS would amend the database and inform the IPHC that the vessel is eligible and an unrestricted
vessel license could be issued to the vessel owner. If NMFS initially determines that a restricted halibut license
would be issued, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Regional Director within 45 days of issuance of the written
notification from NMFS according to the appeal procedures described below. 

Although vessels operating in the halibut fisheries in the waters in and off of Alaska would have to apply for and obtain
a vessel license from the IPHC, only catcher vessels and catcher/processor vessels would be required to be eligible
vessels. 



Vessels Used in the IFQ Sablefish and Halibut Fixed Gear Fisheries 



A vessel operating under the provisions of the halibut and sablefish fixed gear IFQ program would be exempted from
the vessel moratorium as it affects directed halibut and sablefish operations. To implement this exemption, an owner
of a vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1997,
would have to submit to the Regional Director a written application for a groundfish and crab vessel permit. A vessel
permit would be issued if the vessel owner submits a completed application to NMFS as required by   671.4,
672.4, or  675.4. The type of permit issued would be based on the eligibility of the vessel under the moratorium.


An eligible vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries would be issued an unrestricted groundfish
and crab vessel permit. A vessel that is issued an unrestricted groundfish and crab vessel permit may retain amounts
of other moratorium species subject to applicable directed fishing standards.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

An ineligible vessel used in the IFQ sablefish and halibut fixed gear fisheries would be issued a restricted groundfish
and crab vessel permit. A vessel that is issued a restricted groundfish and crab vessel permit would not be able to retain
an aggregate amount of moratorium species other than sablefish and halibut in round weight equivalents in excess
of 20 percent of the aggregate amount of sablefish and halibut in round weight equivalents on board. 



Letter of Authorization 



If a vessel owner submits a complete application for a vessel permit or license, and NMFS preliminarily determines
that a vessel is an ineligible vessel, NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to a vessel owner authorizing a vessel
to harvest moratorium species. A Letter of Authorization would allow a vessel owner who applies for a moratorium vessel
permit or license to continue operating his vessel until NMFS makes a decision regarding its moratorium qualification.


NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to the vessel owner within 30 days of receipt of the application, if NMFS has
not issued a written initial decision to the vessel owner regarding his vessel's qualification. This Letter of Authorization
would be in effect until superseded or rescinded by the Regional Director. 

If a vessel owner files a notice of appeal with the Regional Director, NMFS would send a Letter of Authorization to the
vessel owner within 30 days of the filing of the appeal with NMFS, pending issuance of a written final decision to the
vessel owner on the appeal. This Letter of Authorization would expire 30 days after the Regional Director issues a
written final decision on the appeal. 



Appeals Procedure 



NMFS proposes the following appeals procedure to implement the Council's appeal provisions. A vessel owner may appeal
the initial denial of a groundfish and crab vessel permit, the issuance of a restricted halibut vessel license, or
the issuance of a restricted groundfish and crab vessel permit to the Regional Director within 45 days of issuance
of written notice from NMFS or the IPHC. The Regional Director would decide the appeal on a review of the records submitted,
and issue a written decision on the appeal. If the Regional Director were to determine that in deciding the appeal,
his decision would benefit from industry input, the Regional Director would forward the appeal to the Appeals Board.
NMFS proposes that the Appeals Board would be a committee of the Council comprised of three appointed Council Advisory
Panel members. The Appeals Board would meet publicly to discuss the appeal. After receiving the Appeals Board's recommendation
from the Council, the Regional Director would consider the recommendation and issue a written decision on the appeal.
The Regional Director's decision would constitute the final agency action upon which the applicant would be able
to file suit in U.S. District Court. 

Notice of a proposed rule that would govern appeals of determinations made for the IFQ program was published on February
9, 1994 (59 FR 5979). Public comment is particularly requested on using the same appeals procedure for the IFQ and moratorium
programs. 



Classification 



The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that this proposed rule, if adopted, could have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Based on the EA/RIR/IRFA for the moratorium, total participation
in the moratorium fisheries for a given year is influenced by the annual rate of entrance and exit of vessels. Although
new entrants averaged nearly 900 vessels annually over the period from 1977 through 1991, total participation increased
only 180 vessels per year, on average, because 500 to 1,000 vessels exited the fisheries annually. 

Vessel participation data for 1992 have become available since this analysis was performed. The source of these data
are the State of Alaska fish ticket, NMFS groundfish vessel permit, weekly production report, and catch estimate
databases. 

In 1991, 2,227 vessels fished in Alaska Federal groundfish fisheries, and in 1992, 2,341 vessels fished, for an increase
in 1992 of 114 vessels. Approximately half (46 vessels) of this increase is due to vessels less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA.
Such vessels normally do not make a significant contribution to the overall landings of groundfish. In addition,
vessels less than 26 ft (7.9 m) LOA in the GOA and those less than 32 ft (9.8 m) LOA in the BSAI area would be exempt from the
moratorium. After subtracting such small vessels and considering only those newly permitted vessels that made recorded
groundfish landings in 1992, only about 27 vessels apparently entered the groundfish fishery in 1992 for the first
time, and would not be eligible to fish under the moratorium. With respect to halibut, about 156 ``new'' vessels made
landings for the first time in 1992 (some of these had groundfish and crab landings records also). With respect to BSAI
crab, eight ``new'' vessels made landings for the first time in 1992. Therefore, a total of about 191 vessels apparently
entered the groundfish, halibut, and crab fisheries for the first time in 1992 and may not be eligible for a license
if the moratorium is approved and implemented as proposed. 

The number of ``new'' vessels that entered these fisheries in 1993 and 1994 is unknown because individual vessel catch
data are still preliminary. Assuming that roughly the same number of ``new'' vessels entered these fisheries in 1993
and 1994 as entered in 1992 probably is unrealistic. The Council's moratorium decision occurred midway through 1992.
Most fishermen decide whether to enter a fishery at the beginning of the year. Public knowledge of the Council's action
after June 1992 probably had a negative effect on a decision to enter a ``new'' vessel in 1993 or 1994. According to the
NMFS vessel permit database, about 447 Federal groundfish vessel permits were issued between February 9, 1992, and
March 21, 1994, that had never before obtained a groundfish vessel permit. However, the majority of these ``new''
vessel permits likely were issued to halibut longline vessels, which would be exempt from the moratorium when the
halibut IFQ program is fully implemented in 1995. In addition, some unknown number of these ``new'' groundfish vessel
permits were never used to actually harvest and land groundfish, and others were issued to small vessels that would
be exempt from the moratorium. For the reasons described above, the number is likely more than 35, but less than 100,
based on the available data and knowledge of the fisheries. A copy of the EA/RIR/IRFA may be obtained (see

This rule involves collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) that have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval. Public reporting burden for each year
of this collection is estimated to average 0.5 hours per response for completing each of the six information collection
requests, except for the crab permit application, which is .33 burden hours per response. The six information collection
requests and the estimated number of annual responses are: 1. Crab vessel permit applications, 400; 2. applications
for transfer of moratorium qualification, 715; 3. applications for vessel reconstruction, 143; 4. transfer of a
lost or destroyed vessel's moratorium qualification, 36; 5. salvage of lost or destroyed vessels, 36; and 6. applications
for appeal, 358. These reporting burdens include the time for reviewing the instructions, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden
estimates or any other aspect of the data requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see

West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Disaster Relief 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) has declared that a natural fishery resource disaster exists in the ocean salmon
fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California, due to extremely low stock abundances of chinook
and coho salmon. To alleviate economic hardship, NMFS intends to make grants available to eligible industry participants.
NMFS is requesting written comments, in particular from the fishing industry, Indian tribes, and state fisheries
agencies, regarding appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions it should use in providing the proposed assistance
to persons engaged in commercial fisheries for uninsured losses resulting from the salmon fisheries resource disaster.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Although West Coast salmon stocks experience annual fluctuations in abundance, stock abundances in the last few
years have been exceptionally low. The ocean salmon fisheries off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California
are dependent almost entirely on chinook and coho salmon. For chinook salmon, ocean catches fell from a high of 2,121,999
fish in 1988 to a record low of 444,000 in 1992, an almost 80 percent decline in abundance in only 4 years. The 1993 ocean
catch of 532,999 chinook was also very low relative to historical averages. For coho, the decline has been even more
dramatic, with an ocean catch of 5,334,255 fish in 1976 falling to a record low catch of only 292,000 in 1993_a 95 percent
decline. In 1994, the abundances of many coho stocks are expected to be the lowest on record, and are not expected to
meet spawning escapement goals, even without any ocean salmon fishing. Most chinook stock abundances also are predicted
to be at very low, even record low, levels of abundance. 
Salmon fisheries in the ocean waters off Washington and northern Oregon are closed in 1994. Remaining salmon fisheries
in the ocean waters off central and southern Oregon and California are at reduced levels and are closed to fishing for
coho. It is predicted that 1994 ocean salmon landings will amount to only 289,000 chinook and zero coho. Although fishing
seasons for inside (non-ocean) fisheries have not been completely finalized, they are expected to be the most restrictive
ever imposed in many areas. 
Despite increasingly stringent management measures enacted in recent years to protect these salmon stocks, they
have reached a critical stage of depletion, due in part to environmental conditions unfavorable to salmon survival
that include: (1) An extended drought in California; (2) less than normal snowpack throughout the western United
States; (3) drought followed by extensive flooding in the State of Washington; (4) and an extreme El Ni&ntilde;o ocean
warming event during 1992-1993, which is believed to have been responsible for extremely poor salmon survival.



Impacts on the Industry 


The Pacific Fishery Management Council estimated that, as late as 1988, there were about 5,300 commercial salmon
troll vessels fishing off the West Coast, compared to about 2,300 vessels in 1992_a decline of 57 percent over that
period. 
NMFS' Northwest Region conducted an analysis of economic models that suggest that the 1992 West Coast salmon industry
involved 8,400 full-time work years. However, much of the employment is part time, so that the total number of individuals
impacted by this resource disaster is much greater. Commercial salmon fishermen earned $33.8 million, while marine
recreational anglers spent $79.5 million fishing for West Coast salmon in 1992. In 1992, 140 West Coast processing
plants processed 72 million pounds (32.7 million kg) of finished salmon products, worth approximately $170 million.
These plants employ over 2,000 people for the processing of salmon and other West Coast fish.

Proposed Agency Action 


For the reasons set out above, the Secretary has declared that a natural fishery resource disaster exists under section
308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986 (IFA), as amended (16 U.S.C. 4107). The Secretary has asked
the President to transmit to Congress a request for $12 million to assist those persons affected by the West Coast salmon
fisheries disaster. 
The IFA authorizes the Secretary to award grants to ``persons'' (defined as individuals, corporations, partnerships,
trusts, associations, or other nongovernmental entities) engaged in commercial fisheries impacted by a natural
fishery resource disaster, with the following conditions: 
1. Eligibility for a grant shall be limited to any person that has less than $2 million in gross revenues annually, as
determined by the Secretary. 
2. A person may receive a grant under this subsection for up to 75 percent of any uninsured commercial fishery loss resulting
from the fishery resource disaster (to the extent that such losses have not been compensated by other Federal and state
programs), but shall receive no more than $100,000 in the aggregate for all such losses suffered as a result of the disaster.

NMFS intends to develop specific implementing regulations governing the award of the proposed grants. Section 308(d)
of the IFA requires the Secretary to establish appropriate limitations, terms, and conditions for awarding grants,
including provisions specifying the means by which an applicant must demonstrate claimed losses and limiting the
aggregate amounts that may be paid to persons affiliated with each other or under common ownership. Such limitations,
terms, and conditions are to be established after there has been notice and opportunity for public comment. 
NMFS is seeking comments from the fishing industry regarding the design of an assistance program that will alleviate
economic hardship, including a program that would reduce future levels of fishing effort for resources covered under
the Disaster Declaration. NMFS is considering compensating fishermen who relinquish their state fishing permits
for the lost value of their permits as a result of the fishery resource disaster. Given the pivotal role of the States
of California, Oregon, and Washington in regulating the coastal salmon fisheries, NMFS would need to work closely
with these states in designing an effective program. Although government entities are not eligible under the statute
to receive assistance, NMFS also is requesting comments from Indian tribes, state fisheries agencies, and any other
interested parties. Specific comments and recommendations are requested on the following questions:

1. What would be appropriate goals for the program? How might salmon abundance be increased through this program?

2. Should there be additional eligibility criteria, within statutory constraints, to receive a grant? 
3. NOAA is considering soliciting applications from non-governmental partnerships, trusts, and associations
of fishermen in order to administer significant numbers of awards; do such associations exist? 
4. If fishing permits are relinquished, how can their future reissuance be handled by the states? 
5. What should be the basis for the valuation of the permits, and should inactive permits be valuated differently?
6. What would be appropriate documentation to determine the extent of uninsured losses? 
7. What should be the starting and ending dates of the disaster period for purposes of awarding grants, and what factors
should the Secretary consider in determining these dates? 


Classification 


This advance notice of proposed rulemaking has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

Executive Order 12372 


This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation, which may
require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule entitled Department Programs and Activities
Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this order.



Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed
rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations or policies; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3)
Require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. 


Background 


Pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (the RE Act) (7 U.S.C. 901 

et seq.

), the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) proposes to amend 7 CFR chapter XVII, by revising part 1726, Electric
System Construction Policies and Procedures. This revised part will contain the policies and the procedures applicable
to REA borrowers and contractors when purchasing materials and equipment and constructing electric system facilities
by contract or force account (the REA borrower's own construction crews). 
These policies and the procedures implement certain provisions of the REA standard form of loan documents regarding
the borrower's purchase of materials and equipment and the construction of its electric system by contract or force
account. In order to facilitate the programmatic interests of the RE Act, and, in order to assure that loans made or
guaranteed by REA are adequately secured, REA, as a secured lender, has established certain standards and specifications
for materials, equipment, and the construction of electric systems. The use of standard forms and procurement procedures
helps assure REA that: (1) appropriate standards and specifications are maintained; (2) REA's loan security is not
adversely affected; and (3) loan and loan guarantee funds are used effectively and for the intended purposes.

The current policies and procedures that will be affected are set forth in REA Bulletin 40-6, Construction Methods
and Purchase of Materials and Equipment; REA Bulletin 40-8, Construction Specifications, Drawings and Contract
Forms for Distribution, Transmission and Generation Facilities; REA Bulletin 81-6, Closeout Procedures
and Documents for Contract Construction of Distribution and Transmission Facilities; REA Bulletin 85-1,
Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Contract Construction of Generating Facilities and Associated Buildings;
REA Bulletin 86-1, Closeout Procedures and Documents for the Construction of Buildings Other than Generating
Plants; and REA Bulletin 86-3, Headquarters Facilities for Electric Borrowers. The current policies and procedures
will be changed and updated by this proposal. 
The major substantive proposed changes are as follows: 
(a) This proposal applies to procurement and construction for all projects which will or may be financed, in whole
or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by REA. REA Bulletin 40-6 currently contains the requirements for all
procurement and construction, regardless of the source of funds. 
(b) This proposal would eliminate the current requirement that REA approve subcontracts. (Subcontracts for generating
projects are already exempt from REA approval.) 
(c) This proposal would change the dollar thresholds that determine which procurement procedure is to be used for
a project. 
(d) This proposal would raise the dollar thresholds that determine whether REA approval of a contract is required
and eliminate the requirement of REA approval of certain contract amendments. 
(e) This proposal would eliminate the requirement of REA approval of borrowers' contracts for headquarters facilities.

(f) This proposal would add procedures for procurement of communication and control facilities. 
(g) This proposal would simplify the procedures for the closeout of construction contracts by reducing the number
of forms to be submitted to REA. 
(h) This proposal would revise the REA standard contract forms. The major changes in the contract forms would be as
follows: 
(1) Change the forms to reflect the changes listed above. 
(2) Change the insurance and bonding dollar limits as outlined in 7 CFR part 1788. 
(3) Change the forms to require prequalification of all bidders. 
(4) Change the interest rate on overdue accounts. 
(5) Change the ``Buy American'' provision to include Mexico and Canada in accordance with the North American Free
Trade Agreement Implementation Act of December 8, 1993, Public Law 103-182. 
(6) Change the indemnification clause (also called ``hold harmless clause'') to reflect REA's current policy. 
(7) Incorporate certain technical changes relating to wood treating and right-of-way clearing chemicals. 
In order to reduce printing cost and volume, the forms to be included in this part are condensed, especially the tables.
Also, several forms refer to guide drawings, which do not contain requirements, and, hence, will not be included.
It is intended that once the forms are finalized, REA will reformat these forms similar to their current configuration
(including the tables and drawings) and make them available in that format either from REA or for purchase from the
Government Printing Office. See proposed  1726.300 for a list of the standard forms of electric contracts and
where each may be obtained.

Introduction. 


The policies, procedures and requirements included in this part are intended to implement provisions of the standard
form of loan documents between the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) and its electric borrowers. Unless
prior written approval is received from REA, borrowers are required to comply with REA's policies and procedures
as a condition to REA providing financial assistance for the construction and improvement of electric facilities.
Requirements for REA approval of plans and specifications are contained in part 1724 of this chapter.

Each borrower is responsible for the planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of its electric
system. REA, as a secured lender, has a legitimate interest in accomplishing REA's programmatic objectives, and
in assuring that the costs of construction, materials, and equipment are reasonable and economical and that the property
securing the loans is constructed adequately to serve the purposes for which it is intended. 



 1726.12 

Applicability. 


The requirements of this part apply to the procurement of materials and equipment for use by electric borrowers in
their electric systems and to the construction of their electric systems if such materials, equipment, and construction
will or may be financed, in whole or in part, with loans made or guaranteed by REA. In order for general fund expenditures
for procurement or construction to be eligible for reimbursement from loan funds, in addition to other requirements
of this chapter, the borrower must demonstrate to the satisfaction of REA that the procedures required by this part
were followed. 



 1726.13 

Waivers. 


The Administrator may waive, for good cause on a case by case basis, certain requirements and procedures of this part.
REA reserves the right, as a condition of providing financial assistance, to require any borrower to make any specification,
contract, or contract amendment subject to the approval of the Administrator. The Administrator may, on a case by
case basis, waive certain requirements of this part for major storm damage repair work. 



 1726.14 

Definitions. 


Terms used in this part have the meanings set forth in 7 CFR 1710.2. References to specific REA forms and other REA documents,
and to specific sections or lines of such forms and documents, shall include the corresponding forms, documents,
sections and lines in any subsequent revisions of these forms and documents. In addition to the terms defined in 7 CFR
1710.2, the following terms have the following meanings for the purposes of this part: 



Approval of proposed construction 

means REA approval of a construction work plan or other appropriate engineering study and REA approval, for purposes
of system financing, of the completion of all appropriate requirements of part 1794 of this chapter. 



Architect 

means a registered or licensed person employed by the borrower to provide architectural services for a project and
duly authorized assistants and representatives.

(i) The amendment alters the terms and conditions of the REA Approved Form of Contract; or 
(ii) The underlying contract was made subject to REA approval and the total amended contract price exceeds 120 percent
of the original contract price (excluding any escalation provision contained in the contract). 
(4) If neither of the above two conditions exist, the contract amendment is not subject to REA approval and need not
be submitted to REA unless specifically requested by REA on a case by case basis. 


 1726.25 

Subcontracts.

 1726.26 

Payment to contractor for material delivered. 


When construction is performed under a labor and materials contract, the contractor is responsible for ensuring
that sufficient equipment and materials are on hand at the construction site to allow construction to continue to
completion in an orderly and expeditious manner. However, under certain circumstances beyond the control of the
contractor, it may be necessary to halt construction for an extended period. 
(a) 

Conditions.

 When for reasons which are beyond the control and not the fault of the contractor it becomes necessary to suspend construction
for such an extended period (usually over 30 days), the owner may, at the request of the contractor, consider an amendment
to a construction contract providing for the payment to the contractor of 90 percent of the invoice cost to the contractor
of the equipment or materials delivered to the project site but not installed, provided the contractor warrants that
such materials or equipment are: 
(1) Actually on the site of the project and will remain there until installed in the project. 
(2) In conformance with the contract specifications and not in excess of the quantity required for the project. 
(3) Properly stored and protected from weather, theft, and hazards. 
(4) Capable of being easily inventoried as to the original quantity and each month as to the remaining quantity. 
(b) 

Form of request.

 Requests by contractors for this type of amendment to construction contracts must be submitted by the contractor
to the borrower on REA Form 800, Construction Contract Amendment for Payment. The requests must be prepared in triplicate,
and each copy signed by an authorized agent of the surety. 
(c) 

Approval of request.

 If the borrower agrees to the request, the borrower will sign all three copies in the space provided, and, if the underlying
contract was made subject to REA approval, the borrower will forward all copies to REA for approval. 
(d) 

Payments.

 Payments made under this section are to be made within thirty days after the final approval of the REA Form 800, Construction
Contract Amendment for Payment, provided that the contractor has submitted the proper releases of liens from the
supplier covering such equipment and materials. After construction has resumed, as the contractor is paid for monthly
estimates of assembly units installed, a deduction must be made equal to the invoice cost of equipment and materials
included in such estimates of assembly units installed and for which payment has been made to the contractor pursuant
to the REA Form 800. 


  1726.27-1726.34

Subpart G_Procurement Procedures 



 1726.200

General requirements. 



The borrower must use the procedures described in this subpart where such procedures are required under subparts
B through F of this part. The borrower must ensure that arrangements prior to announcement of the award of the contract
are such that all bidders are treated fairly and no bidder is given an unfair advantage over other bidders. 



 1726.201

Formal competitive bidding. 



The borrower must use the following procedure for Formal Competitive Bidding: 

(a) 

Selection of qualified bidders. 

The borrower, on advice of the engineer, will compile a list of qualified bidders for each proposed contract. The borrower
will send invitations to bid only to persons or organizations on its QBL for the specific project (see  1726.23).


(b) 

Invitations to bid. 

The borrower, acting through its engineer, is responsible for sending out invitations to prospective bidders, informing
them of scheduled bid openings and taking any other action necessary to procure full, free and competitive bidding.
The borrower should send out a sufficient number of invitations in order to assure adequate competition and so that
at least three bids will be received. Subject to the foregoing criteria, the determination of how many and which bidders
will be permitted to bid will be the responsibility of the borrower. 

(c) 

Evaluation basis. 

Any factors, other than lowest dollar amount of the bid, which are to be considered in evaluating the proposals of qualified
bidders (

e.g.,

 power consumption, losses, etc.) must be stated in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders.'' The borrower will,
if applicable, include the relative weight assigned to each such factor and the way in which each factor will be applied.


(d) 

Handling of bids received. 

The borrower or the engineer, as applicable, will indicate, in writing, the date and time of receipt by the borrower
or the engineer on the outside envelope of each bid and all letters and other transmittals amending or modifying the
bids. Any bid received at the designated location after the time specified must be returned to the bidder unopened.


(e) 

Bid openings. 

Bid openings are generally conducted by the engineer in the presence of bidders and a representative of the borrower
and the borrower's attorney. Each bona fide bid must be opened publicly and reviewed for any irregularities, errors,
or exceptions. It must be verified that any addendum or supplement to the specification has been acknowledged by the
bidder. The adequacy of bid bonds or certified checks must be verified at this time. 

(f) 

Conditions affecting acceptability of bids. 

The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist: 

(1) 

Fewer than three bona fide bids received. 

If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract project, the borrower must obtain REA concurrence
prior to awarding the contract. The borrower may, however, elect to return all bids unopened, make changes in the specification
or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids. 






(2) 

Significant error or ambiguity in the specification. 

If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying
interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder
correcting the error or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a
significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject
all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids. 

(3) 

Minor errors or omissions in the specification. 

If minor errors or omissions in the specification are found, the borrower must issue an addendum to each prospective
bidder correcting the error or omission prior to opening any bids. After bid opening, the error or omission must be
corrected following the award of the contract. 

(4) 

Minor errors or irregularities in bid. 

The borrower may waive minor errors or irregularities in any bid, if the borrower determines that such minor errors
or irregularities were made through inadvertence. Any such minor errors or irregularities so waived must be corrected
on the bid in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the borrower. 

(5) 

Non-minor error or irregularity in bid. 

If a bid contains a non-minor error or irregularity, the bid must be rejected and the bid price must not be disclosed.


(6) 

Unbalanced bid. 

If a bid contains disproportionate prices between labor and materials or between various construction units, the
borrower may reject the bid.

(7) 

No acceptable price quoted. 

If none of the bidders quote an acceptable price, the borrower may reject all bids. 

(g) 

Evaluating bids. 

The borrower, acting through the engineer, must conduct the evaluation of bids on the basis of the criteria set out
in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders.'' The contract, if awarded, must be awarded to the bidder with the lowest
evaluated responsive bid. 

(h) 

Announcement of bids. 

If possible, the borrower will announce bids at the bid opening. However, where extensive evaluation is required,
the borrower may elect to adjourn and make formal written announcement to all bidders at a later time. Any discrepancy
in a rejected bid must be indicated in the bid announcement. 

(i) 

Award of contract. 

Upon completion of the bid evaluations and based upon the findings and recommendations of the borrower's management
and engineer, the borrower's board of directors will either: 

(1) Resolve to award the contract to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; or 

(2) Reject all bids. 

(j) 

Certification by the borrower and its engineer. 

The borrower shall certify and the engineer shall certify as follows: ``The procedures for formal competitive bidding,
as described in 7 CFR 1726.201, were followed in awarding this contract.'' The certification executed by and on behalf
of the borrower and its engineer shall be submitted to REA in writing where required by subpart A of this part. 



 1726.202

Informal competitive bidding. 



Informal competitive bidding is limited to major equipment purchases and generation facilities. The borrower must
use the following procedure for informal competitive bidding: 

(a) 

Selection of qualified bidders. 

The borrower, on advice of its engineer, will compile a list of qualified bidders for each proposed contract. The borrower
will send invitations to bid only to persons or organizations on its qualified bidder list for the specific project

The borrower, acting through the engineer, is responsible for sending out invitations to prospective bidders, informing
them of scheduled bid openings and any other action necessary to procure full, free and competitive bidding. In any
event, however, sufficient invitations need to be sent out to assure adequate competition and that at least three
bids will be received. Subject to the criteria in the preceding sentence, the determination of how many and which bidders
will be permitted to bid will be the responsibility of the borrower. 

(c) 

Notice and instructions to bidders. 

The borrower must indicate in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders'' section of the bid documents that bids will
be opened privately. The borrower may elect to conduct clarifying discussions with the bidders. If such clarifying
discussions are held, at least the three apparent low evaluated bidders must be given an equal opportunity to resolve
any questions related to the substance of the bidder's proposal and to arrive at a final price for a responsive bid.


(d) 

Evaluation basis. 

Any factors, other than lowest dollar amount of the bid, which are to be considered in evaluating the proposals of qualified
bidders (

e.g., 

power consumption, losses, etc.) must be stated in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders.'' The borrower will,
if applicable, include the relative weight assigned to each such factor and the way in which each factor will be applied.


(e) 

Handling of bids received. 

The borrower or the engineer, as applicable, will indicate, in writing, the date and time of receipt by the borrower
or the engineer on the outside envelope of each bid and all letters and other transmittals amending or modifying the
bids. Any bid received at the designated location after the time specified must be returned to the bidder unopened.


(f) 

Bid opening. 

The contracting committee will conduct the bid opening in private. The contracting committee will open each bona
fide bid which has been received prior to the deadline, and review it for any irregularities, errors, or exceptions.
It must be verified that any addendum to the specification has been acknowledged by each bidder. The adequacy of bid
bonds or certified checks must also be verified. 

(g) 

Conditions affecting acceptability of bids. 

The borrower must take the following specified action if any of the following exist: 

(1) 

Fewer than three bona fide bids received. 

If fewer than three bona fide bids are received for the contract project, the borrower must obtain REA concurrence
prior to awarding the contract. The borrower may, however, elect to return all bids unopened, make changes in the specification
or the qualified bidders list or both and invite new bids. 













(2) 

Significant error or ambiguity in the specification. 

If a significant error or ambiguity in the specification is found which could result in the bidders having varying
interpretations of the requirements of the bid, the borrower must either issue an addendum to each prospective bidder
correcting the error or ambiguity before bids are received, or reject all bids and correct the specification. If a
significant error or ambiguity in the specification is discovered after the bids are opened, the borrower must reject
all bids, correct the specification and invite new bids. 

(h) 

Clarification of proposals. 

The contracting committee may elect not to hold any clarifying discussions and recommend awarding the contract to
the low responsive bidder. Otherwise, the contracting committee must give at least each of the three apparent lowest
evaluated bidders an equal opportunity to attend discussions for the purpose of resolving questions regarding the
specification and contract terms and to arrive at a final price. Neither prices of other bids nor relative ranking
of any bidder are to be revealed under any circumstances. Upon completion of the clarifying discussions, the contracting
committee will determine the lowest evaluated responsive bid. If no bids are responsive after the contracting committee
has completed clarifying discussions, no contract award can be made under the informal bidding procedure.

Subpart H_Modifications to REA Standard Contract Forms 



 1726.250

General. 



REA provides standard contract forms for procurement of materials, equipment, and construction, for contract amendments
and subcontracts, and various related forms for use by REA borrowers. See  1726.300 for a listing of these forms
and how to obtain them. The standard contract forms shall be used by the borrowers in accordance with the provisions
of this part. REA will give prior approval to certain modifications to these forms without changing the applicable
requirements for REA approval. Such approved modifications are set forth in this subpart. These are the only modifications
given prior REA approval. 



 1726.251

Prior approved contract modification related to price escalation on generation contracts. 



(a) 

General. 

Where the borrower encounters reluctance among manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on
equipment, materials or construction of generation facilities, modifications may be made in the REA standard form
of contracts. These modifications if applicable, may include, as an alternative to the standard form, provisions
for adjusting a base price either upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes between the time
of the bid and the time the work is performed or materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large number
of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower, on the
advice of its engineer, will select the indexes for the particular item to be used in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers'
corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are reported in the BLS's monthly publications entitled
``Employment and Earnings'' and ``Producer Prices and Price Indexes.'' These publications may be ordered through
the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, telephone (202) 720-3238,
or any of the BLS regional offices. 

(b) 

Material and equipment contracts. 

The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the material or equipment
contract forms for generation facilities are as follows: 

(1) Insert new paragraphs in the Notice and Instructions to Bidders as follows:

``Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the
basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either
basis.


Nonfirm prices. 

The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and
material indexes.
A proportion of 

XXX

 percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent
labor cost and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate_

XXX

 [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which
the labor is incorporated in the equipment or materials. The adjustment for labor costs shall be obtained by applying
the percentage of increase or decrease in such index, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the percentage
of the contract prices deemed to represent labor costs. A portion of 

XXX

 percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent
material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, material index 

XXX

 [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the labor cost adjustment.''



(2) Insert the following in the contract documents under the ``Proposal'' section:



``Firm Price $

XXXX


Nonfirm Price $

(3) For generating plant equipment that uses a large quantity of insulating oil, the borrower may insert the following
in the contract documents under the ``Proposal'' section:



``The price for insulating oil shall be adjusted upward or downward based on the change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Refined Petroleum Rate (057) from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the oil is purchased by
the equipment supplier. Contracts shall be evaluated based on an estimated cost of 

XXXX

 cents per gallon [the borrower will enter the appropriate cost] for oil. Such adjustment, if any, shall not change
the contract amount for purpose of applying any other adjustments to the contract prices.''



(c) 

Construction contracts. 

The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the construction
contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:
(1) Insert new paragraphs in the ``Notice and Instructions'' to Bidders as follows:



``Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the
basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either
basis.''


Nonfirm Prices_

The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and
material indexes.
A proportion of 

XXX

 percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent
shop labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings
Rate 

XXX

 [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which bids are opened to the month in which the
work is accomplished. The adjustment for shop labor costs shall be obtained by applying the percentage increase or
decrease in such index, to the percentage of each partial payment deemed to represent shop labor costs. A portion of

 1726.252 

Prior approved contract modification related to liability for special and consequential damages.


This section applies only to major equipment purchases and generation contracts. Where the borrower anticipates
difficulty in obtaining responsive bids on REA standard contract forms due to a lack of limitation with respect to
special and consequential damages, and where the borrower believes that such a modification will encourage competition
through the receipt of an alternative bid which limits the bidder's liability for special and consequential damages,
the borrower may make the following approved phrase modifications in the REA standard contract form on which the borrower
solicits bids:
(a) Insert new paragraphs in the ``Notice and Instructions to Bidders'' as follows:



``Proposals are invited on the basis of alternative Liability Clauses Numbers 1 and 2. The owner will determine on
which Liability Clause basis the award will be made. Any other liability clauses in the proposal or any other modifications
will be considered not responsive and unacceptable. These Liability Clauses are defined as follows:


Liability Clause Number 1. 

This will include unmodified all of the standard terms and conditions of the form of contract furnished by the owner
and attached hereto.


Liability Clause Number 2. 

This will include the following paragraph, in addition to all of the standard terms and conditions, otherwise unmodified,
of the form of contract furnished by the owner and attached hereto:
Except for the seller's willful delay or refusal to perform the contract in accordance with its terms, the seller's
liability for special or consequential damages on account of breach of this contract shall not exceed in total an amount
equal to 

XXX

 percent [the borrower will insert an appropriate percentage between 0 and 100 percent, inclusive] of the contract
price.'''



(b) Insert the following in the contract documents under the ``Proposal'' section:



``Price $ (Based on Liability Clause 1) 

XXXX


Price $(Based on Liability Clause 2) 

XXXX

''



(c) Insert the following in the acceptance section of the standard contract form:



``This contract is based on Liability Clause Number 

XXX

.''


 1726.253 

Prior approved contract modification related to alternative bid provision for payment to contractor for bulk purchase
of materials.


When construction is to be performed over an extended period of time, but large quantities of material are to be purchased
by the contractor at the beginning of the project (

e.g., 

cable for URD installations), the borrower may allow alternative bids providing for payment to the contractor of
90 percent of the cost of such materials within 30 days of delivery of those materials at the job site. The borrower will
retain the right to award the contract with or without the alternative payment provision , however, but the contract
still must be awarded on the basis of the lowest evaluated responsive bid for the alternative accepted. REA Form 800,
Construction Contract Amendment for Payment, must be used by the contractor to obtain payment from the borrower if
this alternative is accepted, and the conditions of  1726.27 (a)(1) through (a)(4) and the payment terms of
 1726.27(d) will also apply to this section.


 1726.254 

Prior approved contract modifications related to REA approval of contracts and amendments.


It will be necessary for borrowers to make certain modifications to various REA contract forms to implement the provisions
of this part. These modifications indicate that certain provisions related to REA approval are not applicable under

 1726.301 

Use of printed forms.



If a REA contract form is required by this part, the borrower shall use the form in the format available from REA or GPO
(photocopying or other exact reproduction is acceptable.) The contract forms are not to be retyped, changed, modified
or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by REA in writing. Any modifications
approved by REA must be clearly shown so to indicate that such are different from the standard form.



 1726.302 

REA approved forms of contract.



If a specific REA contract form is required by a particular section of this part, the borrower shall use that form without
changes or modifications or alterations unless, prior to issuing the bid package to bidders, REA has specifically
approved any such changes to that form for that borrower. Any proposed changes shall not relieve the contractor or
the borrower of the basic responsibilities required by the standard REA contract form, and, shall not alter any terms
and conditions required by law. Changes permitted or required by subpart H of this part or by part 1788, REA Fidelity
and Insurance Requirements for Electric and Telephone Borrowers, of this chapter are approved by REA under the circumstances
indicated.



 1726.303 

Interest on overdue accounts.



Certain REA contract forms contain a provision concerning payment of interest on overdue accounts. Prior to issuing
the invitation to bidders, the borrower must insert an interest rate equal to the lowest ``Prime Rate'' listed in the
``Money Rates'' section of the Wall Street Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued. If no prime rate is published
on that date, the last such rate published prior to that date must be used. The rate must not, however, exceed the maximum
rate allowed by any applicable state law.

filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering

in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed

fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representations or if any of such representations

directions of the Owner. 


(d) The Owner, acting through the Engineer, may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project
make such changes, additions to or subtractions from the Plans and Specifications and sequence of construction provided
for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however,
that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be
granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change is
made. If the cost of the Project to the Bidder to make the change shall be increased or decreased, the contract price
shall be amended by an amount equal to the reasonable cost hereof in accordance with a construction amendment signed
by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator,

1

 but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall
have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or
addition. The reasonable cost of any increase or decrease in the contract price covered by contract amendment as outlined
above, in the absence of other mutual agreement, shall be computed on the basis of the direct cost of materials, f.o.b.
the site of the Project, plus the direct cost of labor necessary to incorporate such materials into the Project (including
actual cost of payroll taxes and insurance, not to exceed ten percent of payroll cost of labor), plus 

XXX

 percent of the direct cost of materials and labor. Labor costs shall be limited to the direct costs for workmen and foremen.
Costs for profit and overhead for subcontractors, if any, Bidder's main office overhead, job office overhead and
superintendence shall not be included. 




Section 4. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted it will make available for use in connection
with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and qualified superintendents and foremen. 



Section 5. Supervision and Inspection. 


a. The Bidder will give sufficient supervision to the work, using its best skill and attention. The Bidder will carefully
study and compare all drawings, specifications and other instructions and will at once report to the Owner any error,
inconsistency or omission which it may discover. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive
constant supervision by a competent superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present
at all times during working hours where construction is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection
with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be
required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent
shall be binding upon the Bidder. 


b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor,
if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the
amount or kinds of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or
Supervisor; but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its
obligations to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. 


c. The manner of construction of the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the
inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required
by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated
in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials,
and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The
Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office
at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions
and instructions of the Owner may be delivered.

Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee of the Bidder at such office shall constitute
delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is
made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 
d. In the event that the Owner through its Engineer, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains
or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have
an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact
nature, extent and location of such defects. 
e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods
as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written
authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days
of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming
work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. 
Section 6. Defective Materials and Workmanship. 
a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment or any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the
subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found to be defective after delivery
or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective before final acceptance of the
construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, including the installation and removal thereof, by
and at the expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site
of the Project by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long
as any defective materials, equipment, or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had
notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. 
b. Notwithstanding the acceptance of workmanship, materials, supplies or equipment, or the giving of any certificate
with respect to the completion of the work, if during the construction or within one year after such completion, or
within such longer period as the Project or any part thereof may be guaranteed by other provisions of the Contract or
the Specifications, the workmanship, materials, supplies or equipment shall be found to be defective or not in conformity
with the requirements of the Specifications, the Bidder shall replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy
any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice of the existence thereof shall have been given
to the Bidder by the Owner. In event of failure by the Bidder so to do, the Owner may replace such defective materials
or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case may be, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner
the cost and expense thereof. 


ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS 


Section 1. Payments to Bidder. 
a. Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for
construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of estimates thereof certified to by
the Bidder, and approved by the Engineer and by the Owner solely for the purpose of payment: Provided, however, that
such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials; and provided further, that in estimating
the amount of construction accomplished, consideration shall be given only to equipment and materials incorporated
into the Project and equipment and materials delivered to the site in accordance with approved shipping schedule.
Only ninety percent (90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the
Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project. Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project,

for his approval and when such approval has been given, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all unpaid amounts
to which the Bidder shall be entitled hereunder unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder. 
b. Interest at the rate of 

XXX

 percent
 (

XX

%) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on all unpaid balances due the Bidder commencing fifteen (15) days
after the due date: Provided that the delay in payment beyond the due date is not caused by any condition within the control
of the Bidder. The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar month provided
(1) the Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of construction completed
during the preceding month, and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall have approved such certification.
If, for any reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been given on or before the fifteenth
day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection ``b'' shall be the fifteenth day of such month notwithstanding
the absence of the approval of the certification.

Owner may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based
upon an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Proposal.

Section 2. Release of Liens and Certificate of Contractor. (See Sample REA Form 224, Waiver and Release of Lien, and

but prior to the payment to the Bidder of any amount in excess of ninety percent (90%) of the total cost of construction,
the Bidder shall deliver to the Owner, in duplicate, releases of all liens and of rights to claim any lien, in the form
attached hereto, from all manufacturers, materialmen, and subcontractors furnishing services or materials for

Section 1. Time and Manner of Work.

(a) The Contractor agrees to commence work on the Project on a date (hereinafter called the ``Commencement Date'')
which shall be determined by the Owner after its acceptance of this Proposal, but in no event will the Commencement
Date be later than 

XXXX

 calendar days after date of acceptance of this Proposal. The Contractor further agrees to prosecute diligently and
to complete clearing in strict accordance with the Specifications and Drawings within 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) calendar days (excluding Sundays) after Commencement Date.

(b) The time for Completion of Clearing shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively
to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor, including acts of God, fires, floods, inability
to obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten
(10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor
shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion
or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall
result in any liability on the part of the Owner.

(c) The sequence of construction shall be as set forth below, the numbers or names being the designations of extensions
or areas (hereinafter called the ``Sections'') corresponding to the numbers or names shown on the maps attached hereto,
or if no Sections are set forth below, the sequence of construction shall be as determined by the Contractor subject
to the approval of the Owner.

(d) The Owner may from time to time during the progress of the work on the Project make such changes in, additions to or
subtractions from the Specifications, Drawings and sequence of work provided for in the previous paragraph which
are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if any change in the work
to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Contractor shall make a
written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change is made. And provided further, that
if the cost to the Contractor of completion of the Project shall be materially increased by any such change or addition,
the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Contract Amendment signed
by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered
unless the Contractor shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection
with such change or addition.

(e) The Contractor will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and
the Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection (a) of this Section 1 shall
not be affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.

Section 2. Environmental Protection. The Contractor shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation
of beauty, conservation of natural resources, and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams.
The Contractor shall not deposit trash in streams or waterways, and shall not deposit herbicides or other chemicals

of the Engineer, the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the Engineer.

Section 3. Supervision and Inspection.

(a) The Contractor shall cause the work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent
(hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where work is
being carried on. The Contractor shall also employ in connection with the Project, capable, experienced and reliable
foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and
instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Contractor.

(b) The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right
to require the Contractor to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools
and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner
to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of its obligations to complete the work within the time
and in the manner specified in this Proposal.

(c) The manner of performance of the work, and all equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection and approval
of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of the Contractor relevant
to the work. The Contractor will provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection. The Contractor
shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner,
when any other inspection is made.

(d) In the event that the Owner shall determine that the work contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall be the
duty of the Contractor and the Contractor's Surety or Sureties to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by
the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such defects.

(e) The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Contractor suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or
periods as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Contractor to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Contractor shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without
written authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number
of days of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Contractor to comply with any
of the provisions of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Contractor with the consent of the Owner,
the Contractor before resuming work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours' notice thereof in writing.

Section 4. Unsuitable Workmanship. The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude
the subsequent rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be unsuitable. Workmanship found unsuitable
before final acceptance of the work shall be remedied, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall
not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any unsuitable workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the
Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied.

the Owner. Upon the approval of such certificate, the Owner shall make payment to the Contractor of all amounts to which
the Contractor shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid.

(b) The Contractor shall be paid on the basis of the number of clearing units actually completed at the direction of
the Owner shown by the Final Inventory: Provided, however, that the total cost shall not exceed the total contract

the Owner based upon an alleged failure of the Contractor to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions
of the Contract.

in the course of work on the Project the Contractor shall at its own expense restore any or all of such damaged property
immediately to as good a state as before such damage occurred. 

(d) Where the right-of-way of the Project traverses cultivated lands, the Contractor shall limit the movement of
his crews and equipment so as to cause as little damage as possible to crops, orchards, or property and shall endeavor

(ii) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Contractor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's
directors, officers, and employees from all liens and claims filed or asserted against Owner, its directors, officers,

or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price.

ARTICLE V_REMEDIES 


Section 1. Completion on Contractor's Default. If default shall be made by the Contractor or by any subcontractor
in the performance of any of the terms of this Proposal, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable
remedies in the circumstances, may serve upon the Contractor and the Surety, if any, a written notice requiring the
Contractor to cause such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within twenty (20) days after the service of such
notice upon the Contractor and the Surety, if any, such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction
thereof satisfactory to the Owner shall be made, the Owner may take over the work on the Project and prosecute the same
to completion by contract or otherwise for the account and at the expense of the Contractor, and the Contractor shall
be liable to the Owner for any cost or expense in excess of the contract price occasioned thereby. In such event the Owner
may take possession of and utilize, in completing the Project, any materials, tools, supplies, equipment, appliance,
and plant belonging to the Contractor or any of its subcontractors, which may be situated at the site of the Project.
The Owner in such contingency may exercise any rights, claims, or demands which the Contractor may have against third
persons in connection with this Proposal and for such purpose the Contractor does hereby assign, transfer, and set
over unto the Owner all such rights, claims, and demands. 
Section 2. Liquidated Damages. The time of the Completion of Clearing is of the essence of the Contract. Should the
Contractor neglect, refuse or fail to complete the clearing within the time herein agreed upon, after giving effect
to extensions of time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with
exactness damages caused by such delay, the Owner shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such monies which
may be then due, or which may become due and payable to the Contractor the sum of 

XXXX

 dollars (

XXXX

) per day for each and every day that such work is delayed in its completion beyond the specified time, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty; if the amount due and to become due from the Owner to the Contractor is insufficient to pay
in full any such liquidated damages, the Contractor shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment
in full: Provided, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Contractor in writing of the manner in which the
amount retained, deducted or claimed as liquidated damages was computed. 
Section 3. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner shall be cumulative,
shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute and the pursuit
of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election: Provided, however, that the provision of Section 2 of this
Article shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the Contractor to complete the clearing within the
time herein agreed upon.

Description of Units 


Right-of-Way Clearing Units: 
R1-10. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 10 feet in width (to be measured on one side of the pole line) of actual
clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required
so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps which shall not exceed 

XXXX

 in height, shall be clear from the ground up of the width specified on one side of the line of poles carrying primary conductors.
This unit does not include clearing or trimming associated with secondaries or services which is included with conductor
units. The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between stakes
and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line. All trees and underbrush across
the width of the right-of-way, as designated by the Engineer shall be considered to be grouped together as a single
length in measuring the total length of clearing. Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed
or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together
and divided by 1,000, shall give the number of 1,000-foot R1-10 units of clearing. This unit includes the removal
or topping, at the option of the Contractor; of danger trees outside of the right-of-way when so designated by the Engineer.
(Danger trees are defined as dead or leaning trees which, in falling, will affect the operation of the line.) The Contractor
shall not remove or trim shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless so directed by the Engineer. 
R1-20. This unit is identical with R1-10 except that width is 20 feet (to be measured 10 feet on each side
of the pole line). 
R1-30. This unit is identical with R1-10 except that width is 30 feet (to be measured 15 feet on each side
of the pole line). 
R1-40. This unit is identical with R1-10 except that width is 40 feet (to be measured 20 feet on each side
of the pole line). 
RC1-10, RC1-20, RC1-30, RC1-40. These units are identical to the respective R1 units except
that chemical treatment of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming.

TM-12. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing
of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps
which shall not exceed 

XXXX

 in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line poles carrying conductors. (See Detail A, Drawing
TM-12-2A). The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the
ground line (See Detail B, Drawing TM-12-2A). All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way
shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail
C, Drawing TM-12-2A). Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush
cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000
shall give the number of TM-12 units of clearing. The Contractor shall not remove or trim shade, fruit or ornamental
trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing. 
TM-12 (1). This unit is identical with TM-12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet wide (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures) (See Detail D, Drawing TM-12-2A.) 
TMC-12, TMC-12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment
of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming. 
TM-13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer
will select those trees of the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Contractor
in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Contractor shall remove or top such trees at his option except that
the Contractor shall trim and not remove shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer
in writing (See Drawings TM-12-2A and TM-13 for examples of danger trees). 
The measurement of length of right-of-way to be cleared shall be considered as a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures, such measurement of length to be based on maximum dimension of foliage
(not trunk) projected to the ground line (See Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing TM-12-2A). Dead trees having
no foliage shall be measured across the maximum dimension and multiplied by two. (See Detail F, Drawing TM-12-2A).
Each tree so removed shall be added together to determine the total length of clearing. All length thus arrived at,
added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of TM-13 units (Example: Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing
TM-12-2A, total .1 of a TM-13 unit). 
TM-14. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on one side of right-of-way center line) of actual clearing of right-of-way. Trees and underbrush should be
cleared from the ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be
cleared to provide ``undulating'' boundaries. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in the right-of-way to the
extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the access road. 
The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or
center line of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail
B, Drawing TM-12-2A). All trees and underbrush cleared across the right-of-way shall be considered to
be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail C, Drawing TM-12-2A).
Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted
from the total measurement. 
TM-14 (1). This unit is identical with TM-14 except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet wide (See Detail D, Drawing TM-12-2A). 
TM-15. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on one side of the right-of-way center line) of actual clearing of the right-of-way. Trees and underbrush should
be cleared from ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be cleared
to provide a ``feathered'' appearance in the right-of-way. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in the right-of-way
to the extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the access road. 
The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or
center line of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to ground line. (See Detail
B, Drawing TM-12-2A). All trees and underbrush cleared across the right-of-way shall be considered to
be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail C, Drawing TM-12-2A).
Spaces along the right-of-way, in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted
from the total measurement.

skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given
to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. 
(b) The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor,
if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the
amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor;
but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations
to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this proposal. 
(c) The manner of carrying out the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection,
tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by the
Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated
in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials,
and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the Project. The Bidder shall provide
all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office at the site of the Project,
with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions and instructions of the
Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee of the Bidder at such
office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany the Engineer
when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 
(d) In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the work contains or may contain numerous
defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection made by
an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and
location of such defects. 
(e) The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods
as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written
authority from the Owner to do so. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days
of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming
work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. 


Section 4._Unsuitable Workmanship


The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof
if such workmanship shall be found to be unsuitable. Workmanship found unsuitable before final acceptance of the
work shall be remedied, by and at the expense of the Bidder. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder
so long as any unsuitable workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not
have been remedied.

ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS 
Section 1._Payments to Bidder


(a) Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for
work accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed rights-of-way clearing units furnished
and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment:
Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent
(90%) of each such estimate shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however,
that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the

subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full. Upon completion by the Bidder of the Project, the
Engineer will prepare a Final Inventory of the Project showing the total number and character of rights-of-way clearing
units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder, will certify it to the Owner, together with a certificate
of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the approval of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator,
the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall

because of the fault of the Bidder. 
(b) The Bidder shall be paid on the basis of the number of rights-of-way clearing units actually completed at the direction
of the Owner shown by the inventory based on the staking sheets or structure lists; Provided, however, that the total
cost shall not exceed the maximum contract price for the construction of the Project as set forth in the Acceptance,
unless such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Administrator. 
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1(a) above, the Bidder may, by giving written notice thereof to the
Owner elect to receive payment in full for any Section of the Project upon: 
(1) Completion of such Section as certified by the Engineer and approved by the Owner and the Administrator; 
(2) Submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the releases of lien and the certificate referred to in Section
2 hereof; 
(3) Approval by the Owner and the Administrator of the inventory in respect of such Section; and 
(4) Submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the consent in writing by the Surety or Sureties, if any, on the
Contractor's Bond to payment in full for such Section prior to Completion of Project. 
If no Sections are designated in Article II, Section 1(c), the term ``Section'' shall mean for purposes of this subsection
(a) and Article IV, Section 3(b) only, a part of the Project as designated by the Owner which represents at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the maximum Contract price as stated in Article III, Section 1. 
(d) Interest at the rate of 

XXXX

 percent

 (

XXXX

%) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on all unpaid balances due on monthly estimates, commencing fifteen

the control of the Bidder. The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar
month provided: (1) The Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of rights-of-way
clearing units completed during the preceding month and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall
have approved such certification. If, for reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been
given on or before the fifteenth day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection (d) shall be the fifteenth
day of such month notwithstanding the absence of the approval of the certification. 




(e) Interest at the rate of 

XXXX

 percent

4

 (

XXXX

%) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on the final payment for the Project or any completed Section thereof,
commencing fifteen (15) days after the due date. The due date for purposes of such final payment shall be the date of
approval by the Administrator of all of the documents requiring such approval, as a condition precedent to the making
of final payment, or ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the
Certificate of Completion, whichever date is earlier. 




(f) No payment shall be due while the Bidder is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Contract and the
Owner may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based
upon an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.



Section 2._Release of Liens and Certificate of Contractor


(See sample REA Form 224, Waiver and Release of Lien and sample REA Form 231, Certificate of Contractor.) Upon the Completion
of Clearing by the Bidder (or any Section thereof if the Bidder shall elect to receive payment in full for any section
when completed as provided above) but prior to final payment to the Bidder the Bidder shall deliver to the Owner, in
duplicate, releases of all liens and of rights to claim any lien, in the form attached hereto from all manufacturers,
materialmen, and subcontractors furnishing services or materials for the Project or such Section and a certificate

any such parallel, converging and intersecting lines, joint line poles, highways or other property are damaged in
the course of the construction of the Project, the Bidder shall at its own expense restore any or all of such damaged
property immediately to as good a state as before such damage occurred. 
(e) Where the right-of-way of the Project traverses cultivated lands, the Bidder shall limit the movement of its crews
and equipment so as to cause as little damage as possible to crops, orchards or property and shall endeavor to avoid
marring the lands. All fences which are necessarily opened or moved during the construction of the Project shall be

not limited to Bidder's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment

ARTICLE V_REMEDIES 


Section 1. Completion of Bidder's Default. If default shall be made by the Bidder or by any subcontractor in the performance
of any of the terms of this Proposal, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the
circumstances, may serve upon the Bidder and the Surety or Sureties, if any, upon the Contractor's Bond or Bonds a written
notice requiring the Bidder to cause such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within twenty (20) days after
the service of such notice upon the Bidder such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction thereof
satisfactory to both the Owner and the Administrator shall be made by the Bidder or its Surety or Sureties if any, the
Owner may take over the Project and prosecute the same to completion by contract or otherwise for the account and at
the expense of the Bidder, and the Bidder and its Surety or Sureties if any, shall be liable to the Owner for any cost or

in completing the construction of the Project, any materials, tools, supplies, equipment, appliances, and plant
belonging to the Bidder or any of its subcontractors, which may be situated at the site of the Project. The Owner in such
contingency may exercise any rights, claims or demands which the Bidder may have against third persons in connection
with this contract and for such purpose the Bidder does hereby assign, transfer and set over unto the Owner all such
rights, claims and demands. 
Section 2. Liquidated Damages. The time of the Completion of the Project is of the essence of the Contract. Should the
Bidder neglect, refuse or fail to complete the Project within the time herein agreed upon, after giving effect to extensions
of time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating with exactness damages
caused by such delay, the Owner shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys which may be then due,
or which may become due and payable to the Bidder the sum of 

XXXX

 dollars (

XXXX

) per day for each and every day that such construction is delayed in its completion beyond the specified time, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty; if the amount due and to become due from the Owner to the Bidder is insufficient to pay in
full any such liquidated damages, the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full;
Provided, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount retained,
deducted or claimed as liquidated damages was computed. 
Section 3. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner or the Government
or the Administrator shall be cumulative, shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or by statute and the pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election: Provided,
however, that the provision of Section 2 of this Article shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the
Bidder to complete the Project within the time herein agreed upon.

Description of Units 


TM-12. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing
of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps
which shall not exceed 

XXX

 in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line of poles carrying conductors (See Detail A, Drawing
TM-12-2A.) The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the
ground line (See Detail B, Drawing TM-12-2A.) All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way
shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail
C, Drawing TM-12-2A.) Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush
cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All lengths thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000
shall give the number of TM-12 units of clearing. The Bidder shall not remove or trim shade, fruit, or ornamental
trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing. 
TM-12 (1). This unit is identical with TM-12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXX

 feet wide (to be measured 

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures) (See Detail D, Drawing TM-12-2A.) 
TM-13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer
will select those trees off the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Bidder
in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Bidder shall remove or top such trees at his option except that the
Bidder shall trim and not remove shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer in writing
(See Drawings TM-12-2A and TM-13 for examples of danger trees.) 
The measurement of length of right-of-way to be cleared shall be considered as a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures, such measurement of length to be based on maximum dimension of foliage
(not trunk) projected to the ground line (See Details E, F, G and H, Drawing TM-12-2A.) Dead trees having
no foliage shall be measured across the maximum dimension and multiplied by two. (See Detail F, Drawing TM-12-2A.)
Each tree so removed shall be added together to determine the total length of clearing. All lengths thus arrived at,
added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of TM-13 units (Example: Details E, F, G and H, Drawing
TM-12-2A, total 0.10 of a TM-13 unit.) 
TMC-12, TMC-12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment
of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming. 
TM-14. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet on one side of right-of-way center line) of actual clearing of right-of-way. Trees and underbrush should be
cleared from the ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be
cleared to provide ``undulating'' boundaries. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in the right-of-way to the
extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the service road. 
The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or
center line of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail
B, Drawing TM-12-2A.)

Trees and underbrush should be cleared from ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark
the trees and brush to be cleared to provide a ``feathered'' appearance in the right-of-way. Low growing trees and
brush are to be left in the right-of-way to the extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the
service road. 

The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or
center line of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to ground line (See Detail
B, Drawing TM-12-2A). All trees and underbrush cleared across the right-of-way shall be considered to

Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted
from the total measurement. 

TM-15 (1). This unit is identical to TM-15 except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXX

 (

Proposal and Acceptance, and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and shall become informed as
to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities, the kind and character of
the soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and during the construction of the Project,
general local conditions, and all other matters that may affect the cost and the time of completion of the Project.
Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including those pertaining
to the licensing of contractors and the so-called ``Kick-Back'' Statute (48 Stat. 948) and regulations issued pursuant
thereto. 

5. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal. 
6. Time of Completion of Construction: The time of completion of construction of the Project shall be as specified
by the Architect in the Proposal. 
7. Bid Bond: Each proposal must be accompanied by a bid bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is
a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder shall agree, provided its proposal is one of the three low proposals, that
by filing its proposal together with such bid bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering
such proposal, said proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such bid bond or check shall be held
by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) is furnished
by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty
(60) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such
proposal is not one of the three low proposals, the bid bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period
of ten (10) days to the respective Bidder. 

8. Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts
of the Proposal and to furnish: 
(a) For contracts in amounts in excess of $100,000, a Contractor's Bond in the form attached to the Proposal with sureties
listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than the contract price.

(b) For contracts in amounts of $100,000 or less, either a Contractor's Bond or a Builder's Risk Policy, whichever
the Owner has specified below: (Check One)

 Contractor's Bond


XXX

 Builder's Risk Policy



9. Failure to Furnish Contractor's Bond or Builder's Risk Policy: Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to furnish
a Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk Policy) satisfactory to the Owner within fifteen (15) days after written notification
of the acceptance of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such
event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check
has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference between the
amount of the Proposal and such larger amounts for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct
the Project. The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder whose proposal is accepted after
another Bidder has previously refused or has failed to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (or Builder's Risk
Policy). 

10. Contract Is Entire Agreement: The contract, effected by acceptance of the Proposal, shall be deemed to include
the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting
from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.


11. Minor Irregularities: The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in the Proposal,
if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities
or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal prior to its acceptance by the Owner. 

12. Rejection of Proposals: The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all proposals.

13. Discrepancies: Where a discrepancy appears between the sum of the Base Bids of each building and the Total Base
Bid, the correct addition of the Base Bid price for each building shall control. 
14. The Owner Represents: 
(a) If by provisions of the Proposal, the Owner shall have undertaken to furnish any materials for the construction
of the Project, such materials are on hand at locations which may be determined by the bidders' inquiry of the Architect,
or if such materials are not on hand, they will be made available by the Owner to the successful Bidder before the time
such materials are required for incorporation into the Project. 
(b) Title to the property on which the Project is to be constructed has been obtained. 
(c) All funds necessary for prompt payment of the construction of the Project will be available.

If the Owner should fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representations or if any
such representations shall be incorrect, the Bidder will be entitled to an extension of the time of completion of Construction
for a period equal to the delay, if any, caused by the failure of the Owner to comply with such undertakings or by any such
incorrect representations; provided the Bidder shall have promptly notified the Owner in writing of its desire to
extend the time of completion in accordance with the foregoing, and provided further that such extension, if any,
of the time of completion shall be the sole remedy of the Bidder for the Owner's failure to comply with any of the foregoing
representations.

(c) The time for Completion of Construction herein set forth shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay
which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including acts of God, fires,
floods, direction by the Architect to cease construction during periods when in the judgment of the Architect it is
impractical to perform any operation of construction and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for
which the Owner is solely responsible, provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted
the Bidder unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension
of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner and provided further, that no delay in such
time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes or from any changes in construction
which may be made pursuant to Subsection (d) of this Section shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. 


(d) The Owner, acting through the Architect and with the approval of the Administrator, if approval of the Administrator
is required, may from time to time during the progress of construction make revisions in the Project. If the revision
is such as to require an extension in the time of construction, a reasonable extension shall be granted if the Bidder
shall make a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such revision.
If the cost of the Project to the Bidder to make revision shall be increased or decreased, the contract price shall be
amended by an amount equivalent to the reasonable cost thereof by a Construction Contract Amendment signed by the
Owner and the Bidder, and approved by the Administrator, if approval of the Administrator is required; but no claim
for additional compensation for any revision will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request
therefore to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such revision. The reasonable cost of any
increase or decrease in the contract amendment as outlined above, in the absence of any other mutual agreement, shall
be computed on the basis of the direct cost of materials, F.O.B. the site of the Project, plus the direct cost of labor
necessary to incorporate such materials into the Project (including actual cost of payroll taxes and insurance)
plus twenty-five percent (25%) of the direct cost of materials and labor. Labor cost shall be limited to the direct
costs for workmen and foremen. Costs for Bidder's main office overhead, job office overhead and superintendence
shall not be included. 


Section 2. Supervision: The Bidder will give sufficient supervision to the work, using his best skill and attention.
He will carefully study and compare all drawings, specifications and other instructions, and report at once to the
architect any error, inconsistency or omission which he may discover. The Bidder will make available during construction
a competent superintendent and any necessary assistants, all satisfactory to the architect. The superintendent
shall not be changed except with the consent of the Architect unless the superintendent proves to be unsatisfactory
to the Bidder and ceases to be his employ. The superintendent shall represent the Bidder in his absence and all directions
given to him shall be as binding as if given to the Bidder. When requested, such directions shall be confirmed in writing.



Section 3. Shop Drawings: The Bidder, after reviewing, will submit to the Architect, with such promptness as to cause
no delay in the work two copies of all shop or setting drawings and schedules required for the work of the various trades,
and the Architect shall pass on them with reasonable promptness, requesting corrections required thereto to be made.
The Bidder will make any corrections required and file with the Architect three corrected copies and furnish such
other copies as may be needed. The Architect's approval of such drawings or schedules shall not relieve the Bidder
of responsibility for deviations from the Plans and Specifications. The Bidder will keep one copy of the contract
documents on the site, in good order, available to the Architect. All drawings and specifications will be returned
to the Architect upon completion of construction.

Section 4. Samples: The Bidder will furnish for approval, all samples as directed by the Architect, and will perform
the work in accordance with such approved samples. 

Section 5. Inspection and Tests: The manner of construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used or
to be used therein shall be subject to the inspection, tests and approval of the Architect and the Administrator, and
the Bidder will furnish all information required by the Architect or the Administrator concerning the nature or source
of materials. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor
relevant to the work. The Bidder will make available at the site of the Project, telephone service where obtainable,
the payroll, invoices of material and other data and records of the Bidder relevant to the work. The Bidder will provide
all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests. If the specifications, the Architect's instructions,
laws, ordinances or any public authorities require any work to be specially tested or approved, the Bidder will give
the Architect timely notice of its readiness for observation by the Architect or inspection by an authority other
than the Architect, and if the inspection is by such other authority, of the date fixed for such inspection, testing
or approval. The Bidder will bear all costs of such inspections, tests and approvals unless otherwise provided, obtain
required certificates and deliver them to the Architect. Observations by the Architect shall be promptly made, and
where practicable at the source of supply. If any work should be covered without approval or consent of the Architect,
it must, if required by the Architect, be uncovered for examination at the Bidder's expense. Re-examination of questioned
work may be ordered by the Architect and if so ordered the work must be uncovered by the Bidder. If such work be found in
accordance with the contract documents the Owner shall pay the cost of re-examination and replacement. If such work
be found not in accordance with the contract documents the Bidder will pay such cost. 

Section 6. Employees: The Bidder will at all times enforce strict discipline and good order among his employees and
shall not employ any unfit person or anyone not skilled in the task assigned him. The Architect and the Owner shall have
the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder or subcontractor if in their judgment
such removal shall be necessary to protect the interest of the Owner. 

Section 7. Defective Workmanship and Materials: Notwithstanding the acceptance of workmanship, materials (except
owner-furnished materials) or equipment or the giving of any certificate with respect to the Completion of Construction,
if during the construction or within one year after such completion, or within such longer period as the Project or
any part thereof may be guaranteed by other provisions of this Proposal, the workmanship, materials or equipment
shall be found to be defective or not in conformity with the requirements of the Plans and Specifications, the Bidder
will remedy or replace such workmanship, materials or equipment within thirty (30) days after written notice of the
failure of the Bidder to conform with the applicable provisions of the contract documents shall have been given to
the Bidder by the Owner. 



ARTICLE III_PAYMENT AND RELEASES OF LIENS 



Section 1. Payments to Bidder: 

(a) On or before the fifth (5) day of each Calendar Month, the Bidder will make application for payment, and the Owner,
on or before the fifteenth (15) day of such month, shall make partial payment to the Bidder for construction accomplished
during the preceding Calendar Month and partial payment for materials not incorporated in the Project. The payment
shall be made on the basis of a schedule of values and receipts or other vouchers, submitted by the Bidder to, and approved
by, the Architect, showing payments for labor and materials, payments to subcontractors, and such other evidence
of the Bidder's right to payment for construction accomplished, and bills of sale or such other procedure as will establish
the Owner's title to materials not incorporated in the Project but delivered and suitably stored on the site or at any
other location agreed upon in writing by the Owner. Approval by the Architect of the application for payment is solely
for the purposes of payment and shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent (90%)
of each such estimate of the cost for construction accomplished and approved and fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
materials not incorporated in the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder prior to Completion of Construction.
The Bidder will, before the first application, submit to the Architect, a schedule of values of the various parts of
the work, including quantities, aggregating the total contract price, divided so as to assist in determining the
accuracy of payments to subcontractors and of the applications for payment. 

(b) Upon Completion of Construction, the Architect shall inspect the Project, and if he shall find the work acceptable
and all provisions hereunder fully performed, he shall furnish the Owner two copies of a Certificate of Completion,
on forms satisfactory to the Administrator, and shall certify thereon the final Contract Price. The Certificate
of Completion shall show thereon the Acceptance of the Contractor. Upon acceptance of the Certificate of Completion
by the Owner, the Owner shall make final payment to the Bidder of all unpaid amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled
hereunder, except that, for contracts requiring approval of the Administrator, the Owner shall submit one copy of
the Certificate of Completion to the Administrator for approval. Upon notice of approval by the Administrator, the
Owner shall make final payment to the Bidder.

such month shall have approved such certification. If, for reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval of
the Architect shall not have been given on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of such month, the due date for purposes
of this Subsection shall be the fifteenth (15th) day of such month notwithstanding the absence of the Architect's
approval of the certification.

approval thereof is required by the Administrator. 




(e) No payments shall be due while the Bidder is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Proposal, and the
Owner may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based
upon an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Proposal.

Section 2. Release of Liens: Upon Completion of Construction of the Project, but prior to the payment to the Bidder
of any amount withheld in accordance with Section 1, (a) of Article III, the Bidder shall furnish the Owner, on forms
satisfactory to the Administrator releases of all liens, and of all rights to claim any lien from manufacturers, materialmen
and subcontractors who have furnished materials or services for the construction of the Project, and a Certificate
of Contractor on a form satisfactory to the Administrator, to the effect that all labor used on or for the Project has
been paid and that all such releases have been submitted to the Owner. 


ARTICLE IV_PARTICULAR UNDERTAKINGS OF THE BIDDER 


Section 1. Protection to Persons and Property: The Bidder will, at all times, take all reasonable precautions for

comply with all applicable provisions of Federal, State and Municipal safety laws and building and construction
codes. 
The Bidder will protect from loss or damage all materials and equipment to be incorporated in the Project, whether

(b) The Project from its commencement to completion, or to such earlier date or dates when the Owner may take possession
and control in whole or in part as hereinafter provided, will be under the charge and control of the Bidder and during
such period of control by the Bidder all risks in connection therewith and the materials to be used therein will be borne
by the Bidder. The Bidder will make good and fully repair all injuries and damages to the Project or any portion thereof
under the control of the Bidder, by reason of any act of God or other casualty or cause, whether or not the same shall have
occurred by reason of the Bidder's negligence. 
(i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors,

or Owner's property or facilities, for services performed or materials or equipment furnished by Bidder, its subcontractors
and suppliers of any tier, and from all losses, demands, and causes of action arising out of any such lien or claim. Bidder
shall promptly discharge or remove any such lien or claim by bonding, payment, or otherwise and shall notify Owner

if it deems necessary or advisable, correct such violation at the Bidder's expense without such prior notices to the
Bidder. 
(g) The Bidder will be responsible for all construction means, methods, techniques, sequences, and procedures and
for coordinating all portions of the construction of the Project. 
Section 2. Insurance. The Bidder shall take out and maintain throughout the contract period insurance of the following

subject to the workers' compensation laws. 
(b) Public liability insurance covering all operations under the contract shall have limits for bodily injury or
death of not less than $1 million each occurrence, limits for property damage of not less than $1 million each occurrence,

(c) Automobile liability insurance on all motor vehicles used in connection with the contract, whether owned, nonowned,
or hired, shall have limits for bodily injury or death of not less than $1 million per person and $1 million per occurrence,
and property damage limits of $1 million for each occurrence. This required insurance may be in a policy or policies
of insurance, primary and excess including the umbrella or catastrophe form. 
The Owner shall have the right at any time to require public liability insurance and property damage liability insurance
greater than those required in subsection ``b'' and ``c'' of this Section. In any such event, the additional premium
or premiums payable solely as the result of such additional insurance shall be added to the Contract price. 
The policies of insurance shall be in such form and issued by such insurer as shall be satisfactory to the Owner. The
Bidder shall furnish the Owner a certificate evidencing compliance with the foregoing requirements which shall
provide not less than (30) days prior written notice to the Owner of any cancellation or material change in the insurance.

Section 3. Purchase of Materials: The Bidder will purchase all materials (except owner-furnished materials) and
supplies outright and not subject to any conditional sales agreements, bailment lease or other agreement reserving
unto the seller any right, title or interest therein. All materials and supplies shall become the property of the Owner
when erected in place or at such earlier time as the parties may agree pursuant to Section 1(a) of Article III. Unless
otherwise specified, all materials shall be new. 
Section 4. Assignment of Guarantees: The Bidder will obtain from manufacturers, materialmen, and subcontractors
and furnish to the Owner all guarantees and will transfer or assign to the Owner such guarantees as run in favor of the
Bidder, prior to the time the Bidder receives final payment. The guarantees shall be in addition to and not limited
by any other provisions of the contract documents, guarantee or remedy required by law. 
Section 5. Royalties and Patent Infringement: The Bidder will pay all royalties and license fees, and will hold harmless
and indemnify the Owner from any and all claims, suits, and proceedings for the infringement of any patent or patents
covering any equipment, materials, supplies or construction methods used in the work. 
Section 6. Compliance with Statutes and Regulations: The Bidder will comply with all applicable statutes, ordinances,
rules and regulations pertaining to the work. The Bidder acknowledges that it is familiar with The Rural Electrification
Act of 1936, as amended, the so-called ``Kick-Back'' Statute (48 Stat. 948), and all regulations issued pursuant
thereto, and 18 U.S.C.   287, 1001 as amended. The Bidder understands that the obligations of the parties
hereunder are subject to the applicable regulations and orders of Governmental agencies having jurisdiction in
the premises. 
Section 7. Delivery of Possession and Control to Owner: Upon written request of the Owner, the Bidder shall deliver
to the Owner full possession and control of any portion of the Project provided the Bidder shall have been paid at least
90 percent (90%) of the cost of construction of such portion. Upon such delivery of the possession and control of such
portion of the Project to the Owner, the risks and obligations of the Bidder as set forth in Section 1(b), Article IV
hereof with respect to such portion so delivered to the Owner shall be terminated; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall relieve the Bidder of any liability with respect to defective workmanship or materials as
provided in Section 7, Article II. 
Section 8. Occupancy Before Completion: Exception as provided in Section 7, the Owner shall not occupy any portion
of the Project prior to the time of completion without the written approval of the Bidder. It is agreed that such occupancy
of any such portion of the Project will not constitute acceptance of workmanship or materials used in construction
of the Project as provided in Section 7, Article II, and that such occupancy will not relieve the Bidder from his obligation
to complete any part of the Project in compliance with the contract. The Owner agrees to permit the Bidder to fulfill
the requirements of the contract in accordance with instructions issued to the Bidder by the Architect upon occupancy
by the Owner. 


ARTICLE V_REMEDIES 


Section 1. Liquidated Damages: The time of Completion of Construction of the Project is of the essence of this Contract.
Should the Bidder neglect, refuse or fail to complete construction within the time herein agreed upon, after giving
effect to extensions of time, if any herein provided for, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating
with exactness damages caused by such delay, the Owner shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys
which may be then due or which may become due and payable to the Bidder, the sum of 

XXXX

 Dollars ($

XXXX

) per day of each and every day that such construction is delayed in its completion beyond the specified time, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty. If the amount due and to become due from the Owner to the Bidder is insufficient to pay in
full any such liquidated damages, the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full;
provided, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount retained,
deduced or claimed as liquidated damages was computed.

such action with respect to any subcontract or purchase order as the administering agency may direct as a means of enforcing
such provisions, including sanctions for noncompliance. Provided, however, that in the event Bidder becomes involved

 all as more fully described in the Plans, Specifications for Construction, Construction Drawings and Contractor's
Proposal therefore hereinafter referred to. 

3. Owner Furnished Materials. The unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal should include provisions for Owner Furnished
Materials since as stated in Article I, Section 3 of the Contractor's Proposal, the value of the Owner Furnished Materials,
if any, will be deducted from payments to the Bidder for completed Construction Units. 

4. Obtaining and Transferring Documents. The Plans, Specifications for Construction and Construction Drawings
together with all necessary forms and other documents for bidders may be obtained from the Owner, or from the Engineer


XXXX

 at the latter's office at

Contract (if the Project is to be financed in whole or in part, pursuant to a Loan Contract) between the Owner and the
United States of America acting through the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration (hereinafter
called the ``Administrator'') and of the loan contract between the Owner and any other lender may be examined at the
office of the Owner. Each set of Plans, Specifications for Construction and Construction Drawings will have a serial

will be permitted, unless made before submission, and initialed and dated. 

6. Familiarity with Conditions. Prior to the submission of the Proposal the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to
have made a careful examination of the site of the Project and of the Plans, Specifications for Construction, Construction
Drawings, and forms of Contractor's Proposal and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and with
the Engineer, and shall become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation
facilities, the kind and character of soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and
during the construction of the Project, general local conditions and all other matters that may affect the cost and
the time of completion of the Project. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations,
etc., including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors, and the so-called ``Kickback Statute'' (48 Stat.
948) and regulations issued pursuant thereto. 

7. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal. 

8. Alternate Designs. The Owner reserves the right to confine its consideration of the several bids to one type of design
regardless of alternate types of design which may be specified in the Plans and Specifications for Construction and
offered in the Proposals. 

9. The time for Completion of Construction of the Project shall be as specified by the Engineer in the Proposal. 

10. Bid Bond. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is
a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder agrees, provided its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, that, by
filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering
such Proposal, said Proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such Bid Bond or check shall be held
by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond is furnished (where required) by the
successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60)
days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal
is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10)
days to the Bidder furnishing same.

11. Contractor's Bond. The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal
and, for a Contract in excess of $100,000, to furnish a Contractor's Bond in triplicate in the form attached hereto
with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than
the contract price. 

12. Failure to Furnish Contractor's Bond. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to execute such counterparts
or to furnish a Contractor's Bond (where required) within ten (10) days after written notification of the acceptance
of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner
shall be entitled (a) to enforce the bid bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered
with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check the difference (not exceeding the amount of the
certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith contract
with another party to construct the Project. The term ``successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder
whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the counterparts
or to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (where required.) 

13. Contract is Entire Agreement. The Contract to be effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall be deemed to include
the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting
from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.


14. Minor Irregularities. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Propose,
if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities
or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the Owner.


15. Rejection of Bids. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals. The attention of Bidders is specially
called to the desirability of a proper balance between prices for labor and materials and between the total prices
for the respective Construction Units. Lack of such balance may be considered as a reason for rejecting a Proposal.


16. Discrepancy in Unit Prices. Where the unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal are separated into three columns
designated as ``Labor,'' ``Materials'' and ``Labor and Materials,'' and where a discrepancy appears between the
sum shown in the ``Labor and Materials'' column and the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column
and the ``Materials'' column, the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column and the ``Materials''
column shall control. 

17. Bidding and Acceptance. If the Project includes more than one substation, bidders may bid on one or more substations.
The Owner may award (1) a contract for all of the substations on the basis of the low total bid or, (2) separate contracts
for one or more substations based on the low bids for the respective substations. 

18. Definition of Terms. The terms ``Administrator,'' ``Engineer,'' ``Supervisor,'' ``Project,'' ``Completion
of Construction'' and ``Completion of the Project'' as used throughout this Contract shall be as defined in Article
VI, Section 1, of the Contractor's Proposal. 

19. The Owner represents: 

a. If by provisions of the Contractor's Proposal the Owner shall have undertaken to furnish any materials for the construction
of the Project, such materials are on hand at locations specified or if such materials are not on hand they will be made
available by the Owner to the successful Bidder at the locations specified before the time such materials are required
for construction. 

b. Title to the property on which the Project is to be constructed has been obtained. 

c. All funds necessary for prompt payment for the construction of the Project will be available. 

If the Owner shall fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representations or if any
of such representations shall be incorrect, the Bidder will be entitled to an extension of time of completion for a
period equal to the delay, if any, caused by the failure of the Owner to comply with such undertakings or by any such incorrect
representation; provided the Bidder shall have promptly notified the Owner in writing of its desire to extend the
time of completion in accordance with the foregoing, and provided further that such extension, if any, of the time
of completion shall be the sole remedy of the Bidder for the Owner's failure, because of conditions beyond the control
and without the fault of the Owner, to furnish materials in accordance with subparagraph a. hereof.

Section 3. Owner-Furnished Materials. The Bidder understands and agrees that, if this Proposal is accepted, the
Owner will furnish to the Bidder the material set forth in the attached ``List of Owner's Materials on Hand'' (see page
10) and the Bidder will give a receipt (see page 12) therefore in writing to the Owner. The Bidder, further, will on behalf
of the Owner accept delivery of such of the materials set forth in the attached ``List of Materials Ordered by Owner
but Not Delivered'' (see page 11) as may be subsequently delivered and will promptly forward to the Owner for payment
the supplier's invoice, together with the Bidder's receipt in writing for such materials. The materials referred
to are on hand at, or will be delivered to, the locations specified in the Lists and the Bidder will use such materials
in constructing the Project. 

The value of the completed Construction Units certified by the Bidder each month pursuant to Article III, Section

the preceding month which have been furnished by the Owner or the delivery of which has been accepted by the Bidder on
behalf of the Owner. Only ninety percent (90%) of the remainder shall be paid prior to the Completion of the Project.
The value of such materials shall be computed on the basis of the unit prices stated in the Lists. Materials, if any,
not required for the Project, which have been furnished to the Bidder by the Owner or delivery of which has been accepted
by the Bidder on behalf of the Owner, shall be returned to the Owner by the Bidder upon Completion of Construction of
the Project. The value of all materials not installed in the Project nor returned to the Owner shall be deducted from
the final payment to the Bidder. 

The Owner shall not be obligated to furnish materials in excess of the quantities, size, kind and type set forth in the
attached Lists. If the Owner furnishes, and the Bidder accepts, materials in excess thereof, the values of such excess
materials shall be their actual cost as stated by the Owner. 

Information on the shipping schedules of materials on the ``List of Materials Ordered by Owner But Not Delivered''
will be furnished to the Bidder as necessary during progress of the work. Upon delivery the Bidder shall promptly receive,
unload, transport and handle all materials and equipment on the ``List of Materials Ordered by Owner But Not Delivered''
at its expense and shall be responsible for demurrage, if any. 

Section 4. Purchase of Materials Not Furnished by Owner. The Bidder will purchase all materials and equipment (other
than owner-furnished materials) outright and not subject to any conditional sales agreements, bailment, lease
or other agreement reserving unto the seller any right, title or interest therein. All such materials and equipment
shall become the property of the Owner when erected in place. 

Section 5. Proposal on Unit Basis. The Bidder understands and agrees that the various Construction Units on which
bids are made are defined by symbols and descriptions in this Proposal, that all said bids are on a unit basis, and that
the Owner may specify any number or combination of Construction Units that the Owner may deem necessary for the construction
of the Project. Separate Construction Units are designated for each different arrangement which may be used in the
construction of the Project. This Proposal is based on a consideration of each unit in place and includes only the materials
listed on the corresponding Construction Drawings or description of unit where no drawing exists. 

Section 6. Familiarity with Conditions. The Bidder has made a careful examination of the site of the Project to be constructed
and of the Plans, Specifications for Construction, Construction Drawings, and form of Contractor's Bond attached
hereto, and has become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities,
the kind and character of soil and terrain to be encountered, and the kind of facilities required before and during
the construction of the Project, and has become acquainted with the labor conditions, state and local laws and regulations
which would affect work on the proposed construction.

Section 8. The Bidder warrants that this Proposal is made in good faith and without collusion or connection with any
person or persons bidding for the same work. 

Section 9. The Bidder warrants that it possesses adequate financial resources and agrees that in the event this Proposal
is accepted and a Contractor's Bond is required, it will furnish a Contractor's Bond in the form attached hereto, in
a penal sum not less than the maximum Contract price, with a surety or sureties listed by the United States Treasury
Department as Acceptable Sureties. 

In the event that the surety or sureties on the performance bond delivered to the Owner contemporaneously with the
execution of the Contractor on any bond or bonds delivered in substitution therefor or in addition thereto shall at
any time become unsatisfactory to the Owner or the Administrator, the Bidder agrees to deliver to the Owner another
or an additional bond.

Section 10. Taxes. The unit prices for Construction Units in this Proposal include provisions for the payment of all
monies which will be payable by the Bidder or the Owner in connection with the construction of the Project on account
of taxes imposed by any taxing authority upon the sale, purchase or use of materials, supplies and equipment, or services
or labor of installation thereof, to be incorporated in the Project as part of such Construction Units. The Bidder
agrees to pay all such taxes, except taxes upon the sale, purchase or use of owner-furnished materials and it is understood
that, as to owner-furnished materials, the values stated in the attached ``List of Owner's Materials on Hand'' and
``List of Materials Ordered by Owner But Not Delivered'' include taxes upon the sale, purchase or use of owner-furnished
materials, if applicable. The Bidder will furnish to the appropriate taxing authorities all required information
and reports pertaining to the Project, except as to the owner-furnished materials.

Section 11. Changes in Quantities. The Bidder understands and agrees that the quantities called for in this Proposal
are approximate, and that the total number of units upon which payment shall be made shall be as set forth in the inventory.
If the Owner changes the quantity of any unit or units specified in this Proposal by more than 15%, and the materials
cost to the Bidder is increased thereby to an extent which would not be adequately compensated by application of the
unit prices in this Proposal to the revised quantity of such unit or units, such change, to the extent of the quantities
of such units in excess of such 15%, shall be regarded as a change in the construction within the meaning of Article II,
Section 1(d) of this Proposal.

to perform any construction on such days when in the judgment of the Engineer snow, rain, or wind, or the results of snow,
rain, or frost make it impracticable to perform any operation of construction and to the extent of the time lost due
to the conditions described herein and approved in writing by the Engineer, the time of completion set out above will
be extended if the Bidder makes a written request therefor to the Owner as provided in subsection b of this Section 1.

b. The time for Completion of Construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively
to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to
obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10)
days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made
a request therefore in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress
of the work which results from any of the above causes, except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability
on the part of the Owner. 
c. The sequence of construction shall be as set forth below, the numbers or names being the designations of substations
or other major facilities (hereinafter called the ``Stations'') corresponding to the numbers or names shown on the
maps attached hereto, or if no Stations are set forth below, the sequence of construction shall be as determined by

 may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project make such changes, additions to or subtractions
from the Plans, Specifications for Construction, Construction Drawings, List of Materials and sequence of construction
provided for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided,
however, that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension
will be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change
is made. And provided further, that if the cost to the Bidder of construction of the Project shall be materially increased
by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Bidder for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Construction
Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator,

2

 but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall
have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or
addition. 





e. The Bidder will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the
Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection a of this Section 1 shall not be
affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection nor by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.

Section 2. Environmental Protection. The Bidder shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation beauty,
conservation of natural resources and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams. The
Bidder shall not deposit trash in streams or waterways, and shall not deposit herbicides or other chemicals or their

Engineer, the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the Engineer. 
Section 3. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted it will make available for use in connection
with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and qualified superintendents and foremen. 
Section 4. Changes in Construction. The Bidder agrees to make changes in construction previously installed in the
Project by the Bidder as required by the Owner. The compensation for such changes shall be as agreed upon in writing
by the Bidder and the Owner prior to commencement of work in connection with such changes. 
No payment shall be made to the Bidder for materials or labor involved in correcting errors or omissions on the part
of the Bidder which result in construction not in accordance with the Plans and Specifications for Construction.

Section 5. Construction Not in Proposal. The Bidder also agrees that when it is necessary to construct units not shown
in the Proposal it will construct such units for a price arrived at as follows: 
a. The cost of materials shall be determined by the invoices. 
b. The cost of labor shall be the reasonable cost thereof, as agreed upon by the Owner and Bidder prior to the commencement
of work. 
Section 6. Supervision and Inspection. 
a. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent
(hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction
is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced
and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions
and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. 
b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor,
if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the
amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor;
but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations
to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal.

c. The manner of construction of the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the
inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required
by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated
in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials,
and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The
Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests. The Bidder shall have an
authorized agent accompany the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the owner, when any other
inspection is made. 
d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain
numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection
made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent
and location of such defects. 
e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods
as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written
authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days
of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming
work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. 
Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship. 
a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner
or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship
shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found
defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the
expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project
by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective
materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not
have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. 
b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner or the Engineer, if any materials, equipment
(except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract
shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Bidder shall replace
such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice
in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Bidder shall be called upon to replace
any defective materials or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested
by the Bidder shall deenergize that portion of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Bidder
so to do, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the
case maybe, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. 


ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS 


Section 1. Payments to Bidder. 
a. Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for
construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed Construction Units furnished
and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer, and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment:
Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent
(90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder
prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination
of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum Contract price has been completed, the Owner may elect,
in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full.
Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare an inventory of the Project
showing the total number and character of Construction Units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder,
will certify it to the Owner together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the approval
of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all amounts to
which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid, provided, however, that such final payment
shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project as specified
in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder.

(15) days after the due date; provided the delay in payment beyond the due date is not caused by any condition within
the control of the Bidder. The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar
month provided (1) the Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of Construction
Units completed during the preceding month and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall have
approved such certification. If, for reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been given
on or before the fifteenth day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection d shall be the fifteenth day
of such month notwithstanding the absence of the approval of the certification. 





e. Interest at the rate of 

XX

commencing fifteen (15) days after the due date. The due date for purposes of such final payment shall be the date of
approval by the Administrator of all of the documents requiring such approval, as a condition precedent to the making
of final payment, or ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the
Certificate of Completion, whichever date is earlier. 





f. No payment shall be due while the Bidder is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Contract and the Owner
may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based upon
an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.


Section 2. Release of Liens and Certificate of Contractor. (See sample REA Form 224, Waiver and Release of Lien and
sample REA Form 231, Certificate of Contractor.) Upon the completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project
(or any Station thereof if the Bidder shall elect to receive payment in full for any Station when completed as provided
above) but prior to final payment to the Bidder, the Bidder shall deliver to the Owner, in duplicate, releases of all
liens and of rights to claim any lien, in the form attached hereto from all manufacturers, materialmen, and subcontractors
furnishing services or materials for the Project or such Station and a certificate in the form attached hereto to the
effect that all labor used on or for the Project or such Station has been paid and that all such releases have been submitted

ARTICLE V_REMEDIES 



Section 1. Completion on Bidder's Default. If default shall be made by the Bidder or by any subcontractor in the performance
of any of the terms of this Proposal, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the
circumstances, may serve upon the Bidder and the Surety or Sureties, if any, upon the Contractor's Bond or Bonds a written
notice requiring the Bidder to cause such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within twenty (20) days after

in the ground nor to perform any construction on such days when in the judgement of the Owner snow, rain, or wind, or the
results of snow, rain, or frost make it impracticable to perform any operation of construction; provided further
that the Contractor will not perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable on public roads or highways
if there are more than two (2) inches of frost in the ground. To the extent of the time lost due to the conditions described
herein and approved in writing by the Owner, the time of completion set out above will be extended. The time for completion
shall be extended for a period of any reasonable delay (other than a delay resulting from the failure of the Contractor
to secure sufficient labor) which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor
including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials, direction of the Owner to cease construction
as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten
(10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor
shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion
or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall
result in any liability on the part of the Owner. 


Section 2_Changes in Plans, Specifications and Drawings. The Owner may, from time to time during the progress of the
construction of the Project, make such changes in, additions to, or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications,
and Construction Drawings as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if the cost to the Contractor shall
be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost
thereof in accordance with a construction contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim
for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Contractor shall have made
a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition.

Section 3_Supervision and Inspection. 


a. The Contractor shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent
superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours
where construction is being carried on. The Contractor shall also employ, in connection with the construction of
the Project, capable, experienced, and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various
classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent by the Owner shall be binding
upon the Contractor.

b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgement
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right
to require the Contractor to increase the number of his employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools
and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner
to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligations to complete the work within the time
and in the manner specified in this Proposal. 


c. The manner of construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection,
tests, and approval of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of

and tests. The Contractor shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and,
if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 


d. In the event that the Owner shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall
be the duty of the Contractor, if requested by the Owner, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner
for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent, and location of such defects. 


Section 4_Defective Materials and Workmanship. 


a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner
shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship shall be found
to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found defective
before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the expense
of the Contractor. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project
by the Contractor at the Contractor's expense. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long
as any defective materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Contractor shall have
had notice, shall not have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be. 


b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner, if any materials, equipment (except owner-furnished
materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract shall be discovered within
one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Contractor shall replace such defective materials
or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice in writing of the existence
thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Contractor shall be called upon to replace any defective materials
or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested by the Contractor shall
deenergize that section of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Contractor to do so, the
Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the case may be,
and in such event the Contractor shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. 


Section 5_Materials Removed. The Contractor will return to the Owner or reuse in the construction of other assembly
units all materials removed from the lines under Section H_Conversion Assembly Units and Section I_Removal Assembly
Units. Upon completion of each Section of the Project the Contractor will return to the Owner all materials, including
usable materials as well as scrap, furnished by the Owner in excess of those required for the construction of the Section
as determined from the Final Inventory approved by the Owner. The Contractor will reimburse the Owner at the current
invoice cost to the Owner for loss and for breakage through Contractor's negligence of materials furnished by the
Owner to the Contractor and for materials removed from the lines by the Contractor. 


Section 6_Term of Contract. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract,
the Contractor will not be required to commence any construction after the expiration of one year following acceptance

<TEXT>
 

Work included in these sections shall be performed under a schedule of deenergization and operating procedures as
set forth by the Owner at the time of release of any Section involving work on existing lines. The Contractor will so
plan and perform its work that it will be possible to safely reenergize all lines involved at the expiration of the time
limits set up in the schedule to resume service to all consumers being served prior to deenergization. Prior to commencement
of work each day on lines to be deenergized, and upon completion of work each day on such lines, the Contractor will notify
the Owner thereof in writing or in such other manner as the circumstances permit. 


Section H_Conversion Assembly Units 


Conversion assembly units are pole-top assemblies and cover the furnishing of all labor and additional materials
for changing an existing assembly unit to a new assembly unit, utilizing certain items of materials of the existing
assembly unit on poles to be left in place. Any materials removed from the existing assembly units which are not required
in the construction of the conversion assembly unit are to be reused by the Contractor in the construction of other
assembly units, or returned to Owner's warehouse, as directed by the Owner. 
Conversion assembly units are specified by the prefix H with the new construction assembly unit designation shown
first and the existing assembly unit designation shown last. For example, an H B1-A1 signifies the conversion
of an existing A1 assembly unit to a B1 assembly unit (as was defined in the description of construction assembly units).
In this instance the Contractor utilizes the existing pintype insulator, single upset bolt and neutral spool and
furnishes the additional crossarm, crossarm pins, braces, machine bolt, carriage bolts, lag screw, and insulator
required for the new unit. The Contractor transports the pole-top pin and two machine bolts to the warehouse or uses
them on the Project as directed by the Owner. 
The Conversion assembly units also include the furnishing of all labor and materials in the transferring, resagging
and retying of conductors from one position on the pole to a different position on the pole where such transfers are
required. Where replacement of conductor is required, the existing conductor will be removed under Section I and
the new conductor installed under Section N. 
Where replacement of a pole is required, the existing pole and pole-top assembly will be removed under Section I and
the new pole and pole-top assembly will be installed according to Section N and no H units will be involved. 
Conversion assemblies are listed in three subsections for converting pole-top assemblies from single to V phase,
single to three phase, and V to three phase. The following descriptions apply to only those conversion units not sufficiently
explicit:

Section I_Removal Assembly Units


Removal assembly units cover the furnishing of all labor for the removal of existing units of construction from existing
lines, disassembling into material items, and all labor and transportation for the returning of all materials to
the warehouse of the Owner in an orderly manner or transporting elsewhere to the site of the Project for reuse in the
prosecution of this Contract as directed by the Owner. All materials removed remain the property of the Owner. The
provisions for Owner-Furnished materials in the Proposal shall apply if such materials are reused for construction
of the Project.
The unit removal prices shall include all materials and labor required to reinstall in accordance with specifications
any conductors temporarily detached. The Contractor will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by
him for his own convenience.
The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly
unit to be removed. For example, an I-A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes
apply to specific removal units:
a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I-30-foot
pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Contractor is not required under this unit to remove from
the pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes
in a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused.
b. Pole-top Assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly
will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused.
The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap
lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the
specifications; for example, an I-A5-4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing
off the tap line at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary
to the new tap assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section
N.
c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling
it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Contractor or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to
the Contractor reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The removal unit for each size of conductor
or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type; thus an I-D 6ACWC signifies the removal
unit for 1,000 feet of 6 A Copperweld-copper conductor.
d. Guys. All guys regardless of length, type of attachment, or size of guy strand are specified by the same unit; thus
an I-E signifies the removal of any guy.
e. Anchors. Only anchor rods are to be removed by the Contractor in anchor removal units. The anchors will be left in
the ground; thus an I-F signifies the removal of any anchor rod. If the rod cannot be unscrewed, the end of the rod
shall either be cut off or bent down so that the rod will be at least 18 inches below ground.

f. Transformers. The unit for removal of transformer assembly units is divided into two sections, (1) Conventional
Transformer Assembly, and (2) Self-protected Transformer Assembly. Only one unit is specified for each type, and
all sizes of transformers from 1 to 15 kVA within each group will be covered by the same unit. ``Self-protected'' refers
to transformers where all protective equipment is mounted on or within the transformer. ``Conventional'' refers
to transformers where protective equipment is mounted separately from the transformer. The unit is designated by
the prefix I followed by the description of the unit to be removed; thus I-G Conventional signifies the removal
of a conventional transformer assembly for any size transformer from 1 to 15 kVA.
g. Secondary Units. The unit for removal of secondary assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of secondary conductor or cables where existing
secondary conductor or cable is to be reused.
In addition, the unit for removal of the secondary assembly includes the handling or holding of any conductor at tap
lines where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such tap conductor in accordance with the specifications.
h. Service Unit. The unit for removal of service assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself,
all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of service conductor or cable where existing service
conductor or cable is to be reused.
The following descriptions apply only to those removal units not sufficiently explicit:









Section N_New Assembly Units


The purpose of this section is to list complete new units of construction where such units are to be added to existing
lines or installed in replacing lines.
The units as covered by this section are the same as the units described in Construction Units_New Construction, except
that these units are prefixed by the letter N.
For example, an N40-6 unit covers the furnishing of all material and labor for the installation of a 40-6
pole either in an existing distribution line being operated by the Owner or in a new line being constructed to replace
an existing distribution line being operated by the Owner.
The following descriptions apply only to those new units not sufficiently explicit:

d. A statement that all required easements and rights-of-way have been obtained from the owners of the properties
across which the Section is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably be expected to object to such construction).

e. A statement that all necessary staking has been completed. 
f. A statement that all necessary funds for prompt payment for the construction of the Section will be available. 
g. Specific instruction as to location and extent of work to be performed on energized lines, if any. 
The Contractor will not be required to dig holes, set poles, install anchors, install underground conduit, perform
any plowing for the installation of underground cable, or dig trenches if there are more than six (6) inches of frost
in the ground nor to perform any construction on such days when in the judgment of the Owner snow, rain, or wind or the
results of snow, rain, or frost make it impracticable to perform any operations of construction; provided further
that the contractor will not perform any plowing for the installation of underground cable on public roads or highways
if there are more than two (2) inches of frost in the ground. To the extent of the time lost due to the conditions described
herein and approved in writing by the Owner, the time of completion set out above will be extended. The time for completion
shall be extended for a period of any reasonable delay (other than a delay resulting from the failure of the Contractor
to secure sufficient labor) which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Contractor
including acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials, direction of the Owner to cease construction
as herein provided, and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Contractor unless within ten
(10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Contractor for such an extension of time the Contractor
shall have made a written request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of
completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes, except acts or omissions of the
Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. 
Section 2_Changes in Plans, Specifications and Drawings. The Owner may, from time to time during the progress of the
construction of the Project, make such changes in, additions to, or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications,
and Construction Drawings as conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if the cost to the Contractor shall
be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Contractor for the reasonable cost
thereof in accordance with a construction contract amendment signed by the Owner and the Contractor, but no claim
for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Contractor shall have made
a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition.

Section 3_Supervision and Inspection. 
a. The Contractor shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent
superintendent (hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours
where construction is being carried on. The Contractor shall also employ, in connection with the construction of
the Project, capable, experienced, and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various
classes of work to be performed. Directions and instructions given to the Superintendent by the Owner shall be binding
upon the Contractor. 
b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Contractor if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right
to require the Contractor to increase the number of his employees and to increase or change the amount or kind of tools
and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner; but the failure of the Owner
to give any such directions shall not relieve the Contractor of his obligations to complete the work within the time
and in the manner specified in this Proposal. 
c. The manner of performance of the work, and all equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection, tests,
and approval of the Owner. The Owner shall have the right to inspect all payrolls and other data and records of the Contractor
relevant to the work. The Contractor will provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests.
The Contractor shall have an authorized agent accompany the inspector when final inspection is made and, if requested
by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 
d. In the event that the Owner shall determine that the construction contains or may contain numerous defects, it shall
be the duty of the Contractor, if requested by the Owner, to have an inspection made by an engineer approved by the Owner
for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent, and location of such defects. 
Section 4_Defective Workmanship. The acceptance of any workmanship by the Owner shall not preclude the subsequent
rejection thereof if such workmanship shall be found to be defective after installation, and any such workmanship
found defective before final acceptance of the work or within one (1) year after completion shall be remedied or replaced,
as the case may be, by and at the expense of the Contractor. In the event of failure by the Contractor so to do, the Owner
may remedy such defective workmanship and in such event the Contractor shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof.
The Contractor shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective workmanship, in respect of the
Project, of which the Contractor shall have had notice, shall not have been remedied or replaced, as the case may be.

Section 5_Materials. At or prior to the commencement of construction of each Section, the Owner shall make available
to the Contractor all materials for such Section which the Owner has on hand, and from time to time as such additional
deliveries of materials, if any, are received by the Owner, the Owner shall make such materials available to the Contractor:
Provided, however, that the Contractor or his authorized representative will give to the Owner a receipt in such form
as the Owner shall approve for all materials furnished by the Owner to the Contractor. The Contractor will return to
the Owner or reuse in the construction of other assembly units all materials removed from the lines under Section H_Conversion
Assembly Units and Section I_Removal Assembly Units. Upon completion of each Section of the Project the Contractor
will return to the Owner all materials, including usable materials as well as scrap, furnished by the Owner in excess
of those required for the construction of the Section as determined from the Final Inventory approved by the Owner.
The Contractor will reimburse the Owner at the current invoice cost to the Owner for loss and for breakage through Contractor's
negligence of materials furnished by the Owner to the Contractor and for materials removed from the lines by the Contractor.

Section 6_Term of Contract. It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Contract,
the Contractor will not be required to commence any construction after the expiration of 1 year following acceptance
of this Proposal by the Owner.

Construction Units_Line Changes 


The general heading of Line Changes applies to the changing of existing lines or portions thereof from their existing
phasing, wire size, and type to new phasing, wire size, and type and the removal of existing lines or portions thereof
and replacing with new lines in close proximity thereto. In general line changes involve three types of assembly units
as follows: 
Section H_Conversion assembly units; 
Section I_Removal assembly units; 
Section N_New construction assembly units on existing lines or in replacing lines. 
The assembly units that are included in Sections H, I, and N are defined by symbols and descriptions which follow together
with the applicable descriptions included under New Construction. Where the descriptions are not correct or sufficiently
explicit, or when special units are not covered by Construction Drawings, descriptions have been provided by the
Owner in the respective sections. 
Work included in these sections shall be performed under a schedule of deenergization and operating procedures as
set forth by the Owner at the time of release of any Section involving work on existing lines. The Contractor will so
plan and perform its work that it will be possible to safely reenergize all lines involved at the expiration of the time
limits set up in the schedule to resume service to all consumers being served prior to deenergization. Prior to commencement
of work each day on lines to be deenergized, and upon completion of work each day on such lines, the Contractor will notify
the Owner thereof in writing or in such other manner as the circumstances permit. 


SECTION H_CONVERSION ASSEMBLY UNITS 


Conversion assembly units are pole-top assemblies and cover the furnishing of all labor for changing an existing
assembly unit to a new assembly unit, utilizing certain items of materials of the existing assembly unit on poles to
be left in place. Any materials removed from the existing assembly units which are not required in the construction
of the conversion assembly unit are to be reused by the Contractor in the construction of other assembly units, or returned
to Owner's warehouse, as directed by the Owner. 
Conversion assembly units are specified by the prefix H with the new construction assembly unit designation shown
first and the existing assembly unit designation shown last. For example, an H B1-A1 signifies the conversion
of an existing A1 assembly unit to a B1 assembly unit (as was defined in the description of construction assembly units).
In this instance the Contractor utilizes the existing pin-type insulator, single upset bolt and neutral spool and
installs the additional crossarm, crossarm pins, braces, machine bolt, carriage bolts, lag screw, and insulator
supplied by the Owner required for the new unit. The Contractor transports the pole-top pin and two machine bolts to
the warehouse or uses them on the Project as directed by the Owner. 

The Conversion assembly units also include the furnishing of all labor in the transferring, resagging and retying
of conductors from one position on the pole to a different position on the pole where such transfers are required. Where
replacement of conductor is required, the existing conductor will be removed under section I and the new conductor
installed under section N. 
Where replacement of a pole is required, the existing pole and pole-top assembly will be removed under section I and
the new pole and pole-top assembly will be installed according to section N and no H units will be involved. 

Conversion assemblies are listed in three subsections for converting pole-top assemblies from single to V phase,
single to three phase, and V to three phase. The following descriptions apply to only those conversion units not sufficiently
explicit: 







Subsection H (B-A) 1 Phase to V Phase 





 

Subsection H (C-A) 1 Phase to 3 Phase

Subsection H (C-B) V Phase to 3 Phase 





SECTION I_REMOVAL ASSEMBLY UNITS 



Removal assembly units cover the furnishing of all labor for the removal of existing units of construction from existing
lines, disassembling into material items, and all labor and transportation for the returning of all materials to
the warehouse of the Owner in an orderly manner or transporting elsewhere to the site of the Project for reuse in the
prosecution of this Contract as directed by the Owner. 

The unit removal prices shall include all labor required to reinstall in accordance with specifications any conductors
temporarily detached. The Contractor will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by him for his own convenience.
The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly
unit to be removed. For example, an I-A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes
apply to specific removal units: 

a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I-30-foot
pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Contractor is not required under this unit to remove from
the pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes
in a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused. 

b. Pole-top assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly
will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused. 

The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap
lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the
Specifications; for example, an I-A5-4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing
off the tap line at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary
to the new tap assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section
N. 

c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling
it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Contractor or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to
the Contractor reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The removal unit for each size of conductor
or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type; thus an I-D 6ACWC signifies the removal
unit for 1,000 feet of 6 A Copperweld-copper conductor.

<TEXT>
 

d. Guys. All guys regardless of length, type of attachment, or size of guy strand are specified by the same unit; thus
an I-E signifies the removal of any guy. 
e. Anchors. Only anchor rods are to be removed by the Contractor in anchor removal units. The anchors will be left in
the ground; thus an I-F signifies the removal of any anchor rod. If the rod cannot be unscrewed, the end of the rod
shall either be cut off or bent down so that the rod will be at least 18 inches below ground. 
f. Transformers. The unit for removal of transformer assembly units is divided into two sections, (1) Conventional
Transformer Assembly, and (2) Self-protected Transformer Assembly. Only one unit is specified for each type, and
all sizes of transformers from 1 to 15 kVA within each group will be covered by the same unit. ``Self-protected'' refers
to transformers where all protective equipment is mounted on or within the transformer. ``Conventional'' refers
to transformers where protective equipment is mounted separately from the transformer. The unit is designated by
the prefix I followed by the description of the unit to be removed; thus, I-G Conventional signifies the removal
of a conventional transformer assembly for any size transformer from 1 to 15 kVA. 
g. Secondary units. The unit for removal of secondary assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of secondary conductor or cables where existing
secondary conductor or cable is to be reused. 
In addition, the unit for removal of the secondary assembly includes the handling or holding of any conductor at tap
lines where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such tap conductor in accordance with the Specifications. 
h. Service unit. The unit for removal of service assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself,
all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of service conductor or cable where existing service
conductor or cable is to be reused. 
The following descriptions apply only to those removal units not sufficiently explicit: 









SECTION N_NEW ASSEMBLY UNITS 


The purpose of this section is to list complete new units of construction where such units are to be added to existing
lines or installed in replacing lines. 
The units as covered by this section are the same as the units described in Construction Units_New Construction, except
that these units are prefixed by the letter N. 
For example, an N40-6 unit covers the furnishing of all labor for the installation of a 40-6 pole either
in an existing distribution line being operated by the Owner or in a new line being constructed to replace an existing
distribution line being operated by the Owner. 
The following descriptions apply only to those new units not sufficiently explicit:

 and are more fully described in the Plans, Specifications, and Contractor's Proposal. For work in these locations
the Bidder must provide personnel capable of working on energized lines. All such work shall be performed to meet at
least the safety rules and regulations prescribed by the Owner for its own employees including the use of rubber gloves,
hot sticks and associated protective equipment, a copy of which rules and regulations may be examined at the office
of the Owner.

4. Owner-furnished materials. The unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal should include provisions for Owner-Furnished
Materials since as stated in Article I, Section 3 of the Contractor's Proposal, the value of the Owner-Furnished Materials,
if any, will be deducted from payments to the Bidder for completed Construction Units.

5. Obtaining and transferring documents. The Plans, Specifications and Construction Drawings, together with all
necessary forms and other documents for bidders may be obtained from the Owner, or from the Engineer 

XXXX

 at the latter's office at 

XXXX

 upon the payment of ten dollars ($10), which payment will not be subject to refund. The Plans, Specifications, and
Construction Drawings may be examined at the office of the Owner or at the office of the Engineer. A copy of the Loan Contract
(if the Project is to be financed, in whole or in part, pursuant to a loan contract) between the Owner and the United States
of America acting through the Administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration and of the loan contract
between the Owner and any other lender may be examined at the office of the Owner. Each set of Plans, Specifications
and Construction Drawings will have a serial number, given by the Engineer, and the number of each set with the name
of the purchaser will be recorded by the Engineer. Bids will be accepted only from the original purchaser.

6. Manner of submitting proposals. Proposals and all supporting instruments must be submitted on the forms furnished
by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its
license number if a license is required by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope
in which the Proposal is submitted. Proposals must be filled in in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations
will be permitted, unless made before submission, and initialed and dated.

7. Familiarity with conditions. Prior to the submission of the Proposal the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to
have made a careful examination of the site of the Project and of the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings,
and forms of Contractor's Proposal and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and with the Engineer,
and shall become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities,
the kind and character of soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and during the
construction of the Project, general local conditions and all other matters that may affect the cost and time of completion
of the Project. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including those
pertaining to the licensing of contractors, and the so-called ``Kick-Back Statute'' (48 State. 948) and regulations
issued pursuant thereto.

8. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal.

9. Alternate designs. The Owner reserves the right to confine its consideration of the several bids to one type of design
regardless of alternate types of design which may be specified in the Plans and Specifications and offered in the Proposals.

10. Proposals for distribution and transmission facilities. If the Project includes both distribution and transmission
facilities, bidders shall bid on both of the facilities and the Owner will evaluate the Proposals on the basis of low
total bid for both facilities.

11. The Time for Completion of Construction of the Project shall be as specified by the Engineer in the Proposal.

12. Bid bond. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is
a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder agrees, provided its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, that, by
filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the Owner's receiving and considering
such Proposals, said Proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such Bid Bond or check shall be held
by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond is furnished (where required) by the
successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60)
days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal
is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10)
days to the Bidder furnishing same.

13. Contractor's bond. The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal
and, for a Contract in excess of $100,000, to furnish a Contractor's Bond in triplicate in the form attached hereto
with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than
the contract price.

14. Failure to furnish contractor's bond. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to execute such counterparts
or to furnish a Contractor's Bond (where required) within ten (10) days after written notification of the acceptance
of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner
shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered
with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check, the difference (not exceeding the amount of
the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith
contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``Successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any
Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the counterparts
or to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (where required.)

15. Contract is entire agreement. The Contract to be effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall be deemed to include
the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modifications thereof resulting
from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.

16. Minor irregularities. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal,
if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities
or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the Owner.

17. Balanced bid. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals. The attention of Bidders is specially
called to the desirability of a proper balance between prices for labor and materials and between the total prices
for the respective Construction Units. Lack of such balance may be considered as a reason for rejecting a Proposal.

18. Discrepancy in unit prices. Where the unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal are separated into three columns
designated as ``Labor,'' ``Materials,'' and ``Labor and Materials,'' and where a discrepancy appears between the
sum shown in the ``Labor and Materials'' column and the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column
and the ``Materials'' column, the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column and the ``Materials''
column shall control.

19. Definition of terms. The terms 

Administrator, Engineer, Supervisor, Project, Completion of Construction,

 and 

Completion of the Project

 as used throughout this Contract shall be as defined in Article VI, Section 1, of the Contractor's Proposal.

20. The owner represents:

a. If by provisions of the Contractor's Proposal the Owner shall have undertaken to furnish any materials for the construction
of the Project, such materials are on hand at locations specified or if such materials are not on hand they will be made
available by the Owner to the successful Bidder at the locations specified before the time such materials are required
for construction.

b. All easements and rights-of-way, except as shown on maps included in the Plans and Specifications, have been obtained
from the owners of the properties across which the Project is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably
be expected to object to such construction). The remaining easements and rights-of-way, if any, will be obtained
as required to avoid delay in construction.

c. All staking, except as shown on the maps included in the Plans and Specifications, has been completed and sufficient
staking crews will be available to maintain stakes at all times in advance of construction.

d. Where underground distribution construction is required, permission has been obtained from state and local highway
and road authorities to install underground distribution power facilities and set pedestals, if any, on the highway
and road right-of-way in the Project area. Notwithstanding such permission granted to the Owner, each Bidder is responsible
for ascertaining that the equipment, methods of construction, and repair proposed to be used on the Project will meet
all requirements of public authorities having jurisdiction over highway and road right-of-way. The successful
Bidder will be required to furnish proof satisfactory to the Owner of compliance with this requirement. If required
by highway or road authorities, the successful Bidder will furnish to such authorities a bond or meet other guaranty
requirements to assure the prompt repair of all damages to highways and roads and their associated rights-of-way
caused by the Bidder during construction of the Project. This requirement is in addition to and independent of the
Contractor's Bond required under this Contract. The acceptance of a bid from any Bidder is not to be construed as approval
of the Bidder's equipment or proposed construction methods by or on behalf of the highway and road authorities. Bidders
may obtain information concerning the requirements of highway and road authorities by communicating with the following


XXXX

.

e. All funds necessary for prompt payment for the construction of the Project will be available.

If the Owner shall fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representation or if any of
such representations shall be incorrect, the Bidder will be entitled to an extension of time of completion for a period
equal to the delay, if any, caused by the failure of the Owner to comply with such undertakings or by any such incorrect
representation; provided the Bidder shall have promptly notified the Owner in writing of its desire to extend the
time of completion in accordance with the foregoing; provided, however, that such extension, if any, of the time of
completion shall be the sole remedy of the Bidder for the Owner's failure, because of conditions beyond the control
and without the fault of the Owner, to furnish materials in accordance with subparagraph a. above.

Section 1. Time and Manner of Construction 
a. The Bidder agrees to commence construction of the Project on a date (hereinafter called the ``Commencement Date'')
which shall be determined by the Engineer after notice in writing from the Bidder that the Bidder has sufficient materials
to warrant commencement and continuation of construction, but in no event will the Commencement Date be later than


XXX

 calendar days after date of approval of the Contract by the Administrator. The Bidder further agrees to prosecute
diligently and to complete construction in strict accordance with the Plans, Specifications and Construction Drawings
within 

XXX

 (

XXX

) calendar days (excluding Sundays) after Commencement Date: Provided, however, that the Bidder will not be required
to dig holes, set poles, install anchors, install underground conduit, perform any plowing for the installation
of underground cable, or dig trenches if there are more than six (6) inches of frost on the ground nor to perform any construction
on such days when in the judgment of the Engineer snow, rain, or wind, or the results of snow, rain, or frost make it impracticable
to perform any operation of construction; provided further that the Bidder will not be required to perform any plowing
for the installation of underground cable on public roads or highways if there are more than two (2) inches of frost
in the ground. To the extent of the time lost due to the conditions described herein and approved in writing by the Engineer,
the time of completion set out above will be extended if the Bidder makes a written request therefore to the Owner as
provided in subsection b of this Section 1. 
b. The time for Completion of Construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively
to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including Acts of God, fires, floods, inability to
obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10)
days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made
a request therefore in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress
of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability

d. The Owner, acting through the Engineer may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project
make such changes, additions or subtractions from the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings, List of Materials
and sequence of construction provided for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as
conditions may warrant: Provided, however, that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension
of time, a reasonable extension will be granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefore to the Owner within
(10) days after any such change is made. And provided further, that if the cost to the Bidder of construction of the project
shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Bidder for the reasonable cost
thereof in accordance with a Construction Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder, but no claim for additional
compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request
therefore to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. 

e. The Bidder will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the
Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection a of this Section 1 shall not be
affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection nor by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.


Section 2. Environmental Protection. The Bidder shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation of
beauty, consideration of natural resources and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams.
The Bidder shall not deposit trash in streams or waterways, and shall not deposit herbicides or other chemicals or
their containers in or near streams, waterways or pastures. The Bidder shall follow the criteria relating to environmental
protection as specified herein by the Engineer. 

Section 3. Tools, Equipment, and Qualified Personnel. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted
it will make available for use in connection with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and
qualified superintendents and foremen. 

Section 4. Changes in Construction. The Bidder agrees to make such changes in construction previously erected in
the Project by the Bidder as required by the Owner for prices arrived at as follows: 

a. For substations and other units where only a portion of the complete unit is affected by the change, the compensation
for such change shall be as agreed upon in writing by the Bidder and the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection
with such change. 

b. For all other units, the compensation for such change shall be the reasonable cost thereof as agreed upon by the Bidder
and the Owner, but in no event shall it exceed two (2) times the labor price quoted in the Proposal for the installation
of the unit to be changed. Such compensation shall be in lieu of any other payment for the installation and removal of
the original unit. (If a new or replacing unit is installed, payment for such new or replacing unit shall be made as shown
in the final inventory.) 

No payment shall be made to the Bidder for materials or labor involved in correcting errors or omissions on the part
of the Bidder which result in construction not in accordance with the Plans and Specifications. 

Section 5. Construction Not in Proposal. The Bidder also agrees that when it is necessary to construct units not shown
in the Proposal it will construct such units for a price arrived at as follows: 

a. The cost of materials shall be determined by the invoices. 

b. The cost of labor shall be the reasonable cost thereof, but in no event shall it exceed an amount determined by calculating
the ratio of the total labor costs to the total material costs in the section of the Proposal involved, and multiplying
the cost of materials for the unit in question by this ratio: Provided, however, that in respect of sections H, M, and
N, the ratio shall be calculated for only those units of the section which are similar to the new unit for which a price
is to be determined. 

Section 6. Supervision and Inspection. 

a. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent
(hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction
is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced
and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions
and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. 

b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor,
if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the
amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor;
but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations
to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. 

c. The construction of the Project and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the inspection,
tests, and acceptance by the Owner and the Administrator and the Bidder shall furnish all information required by
the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated
in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials,
and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The
Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office
at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions
and instructions of the Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee
of the Bidder at such office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany
the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 

d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain
numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection
made by an engineer approved by the Owner for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent and location of such
defects.

e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods
as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written
authority from the Owner so to do. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days
of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming
work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. 

Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship. 

a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except Owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner
or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship
shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found

ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS



Section 1. Payments to Bidder 

a. Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for
construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed Construction Units furnished
and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment:
Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent
(90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder
prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination
of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the maximum Contract price has been completed, the Owner may elect,
in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full.
Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare an inventory of the Project
showing the total number and character of Construction Units and, after checking such inventory with the Bidder,
will certify it to the Owner. Upon the approval by the Owner and the Administrator of a Certificate of Completion_Contract
Construction, REA Form 187, showing the total cost of the construction performed, the Owner shall make payment to
the Bidder of all amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid: Provided,
however, that such final payment shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction
of the Project, as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder.


b. The Bidder shall be paid on the basis of the number of Construction Units actually installed at the direction of the
Owner shown by the inventory based on the staking sheets or structure lists; Provided, however, that the total cost
shall not exceed the maximum Contract price for the construction of the Project as set forth in the Acceptance plus
the costs of any additional change orders, unless such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Owner. 

c. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.a above, the Bidder may, by giving written notice thereof to the Owner,
elect to receive payment in full for any Section of the Project upon: 

(1) completion of such Section as certified by the Engineer and approved by the Owner; 

(2) submission to the Owner of the releases of lien and the certificate referred to in Section 2 hereof; 

(3) approval by the Owner of the inventory in respect of such Section; and 

(4) submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the consent in writing by the Surety or Sureties, if any, on the
Contractor's Bond to payment in full for such Section prior to Completion of the Project. 

If no Sections are designated in Article II, section 1c, the term 

Section

 shall mean for purposes of this subsection c and Article IV, section 3b only, a part of the Project as designated by the
Owner which represents at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the maximum Contract price as stated in Article III,
Section 1, and which is capable of being energized and operated by the Owner.

Provided, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount retained,
deducted or claimed as liquidated damages was computed.

SECTION H_CONVERSION ASSEMBLY UNITS 



Conversion assembly units are pole-top assemblies and cover the furnishing of all labor and additional materials
for changing an existing assembly unit to a new assembly unit, utilizing certain items of materials of the existing
assembly unit on poles to be left in place. The unit prices for materials should include only additional material that
is required to complete the new unit, less suitable allowance for material removed. 

Any materials removed from the existing assembly units which are not required in the construction of the conversion
assembly unit become the property of the Bidder and may, with the permission of the Engineer, be reused by the Bidder
in the construction of other assembly units called for in the Construction Contract. Conversion assembly units are
specified by the prefix H with the new construction assembly unit designation shown first and the existing assembly
unit designation shown last. For example, a H B1-A1 signifies the conversion of an existing A1 assembly unit
to a B1 assembly unit (as was defined in the description of construction assembly units). In this instance the Bidder
utilizes the existing pin-type insulator, single upset bolt and neutral spool in the construction of the new assembly
unit. The Bidder furnishes the additional crossarm, crossarm pins, braces, machine bolt, carriage bolts, lag screw,
and insulator required for the new unit. The Bidder takes possession of the pole-top pin and two machine bolts and with
the permission of the Engineer may reuse these elsewhere in the construction of the Project. The Bidder will not be
held accountable to the Owner for the materials he so acquires. 

The Conversion assembly units also include the furnishing of all labor and materials in the transferring, resagging
and retying of conductors from one position on the pole to a different position on the pole where such transfers are
required. Where replacement of conductor is required, the existing conductor will be removed under section I and
the new conductor installed under section N. Where replacement of a pole is required, the existing pole and pole-top
assembly will be removed under section I and the new pole and pole-top assembly will be installed according to section
N and no H units will be involved. 

Conversion assemblies are listed in three subsections for converting pole-top assemblies from single to V phase,
single to three phase, and V to three phase. The following descriptions apply to only those units not sufficiently
explicit.

SECTION I_REMOVAL ASSEMBLY UNITS 



Removal assembly units cover the furnishing of all labor for the removal of existing units of construction from existing
lines, disassembling into material items, and all labor and transportation for the returning of all materials to
the warehouse of the Owner in an orderly manner or transporting elsewhere to the site of the Project for reuse in the
prosecution of this Contract as approved by the Engineer. 

The Bidder will be charged by the Owner for the full value of all materials removed under this section at the value shown
in Table C. Such charges will be placed against the Bidder as units are removed and the value will be deducted from the
total value of installed assembly units for determination of the work accomplished for purposes of monthly progress
payments to the Bidder. 

Of the materials listed in Table C to be removed from existing lines, certain materials will be reused in the construction
of the Project. Such materials to be reused are listed in Table C-1. Materials other than those listed in Table
C-1 shall, if not damaged in handling, be returned to the Owner for full credit at the values shown in Table D. The
Bidder will be allowed full credit for all material items, other than those listed in Table C-1, returned to the
Owner which, in the opinion of the Engineer, were not damaged by the Bidder in removal and handling even though the materials
may not be reusable for reasons of obsolescence or deterioration. Such credits shall be allowed the Bidder as materials
are returned to the Owner's warehouse and shall be added to the total value of installed assembly units for determination
of the work accomplished for purposes of monthly progress payments to the Bidder.

The unit removal prices shall include all material and labor required to reinstall in accordance with specifications
any conductors temporarily detached. The Bidder will reinstall at his own expense any other units removed by him for
his own convenience. 
The removal units are specified by the prefix I and followed by the assembly unit designation of existing assembly
unit to be removed. For example, an I-A1 signifies the removal of an A1 assembly unit. The following special notes
apply to specific removal units: 

XXXX

.
a. Poles. All poles of the same height, regardless of pole class, are designated by the same unit. Thus an I-30-foot
pole signifies the removal of a 30-foot pole of any class. The Bidder is not required under this unit to remove from the
pole any ground wire or pole numbering attached to the pole. This unit includes the refilling and tamping of holes in
a workmanlike manner unless they are to be reused. 
b. Pole-Top Assemblies. The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, any necessary handling, resagging, and retying of conductors in those cases where an existing pole-top assembly
will be removed and replaced by a new pole-top assembly and where any existing conductor is to be reused. 
The unit of removal of pole-top assemblies also includes any holding or handling of mainline or tap conductors at tap
lines, angles, and deadends where such is involved, and reinstalling of such conductor in accordance with the specifications;
for example, an I-A5-4 will include the disconnection of the tap conductors, snubbing off the tap line
at the nearest practical point and the reconnection and resagging of these tap conductors if necessary to the new tap
assembly when installed. The new unit of construction, however, will be specified separately in Section N. 
c. Conductor. The conductor removal unit covers the removal of 1,000 feet of conductor or cable and reeling or coiling
it in a workmanlike manner in such a way that it can be reused by the Bidder or the Owner. The Owner will furnish to the Bidder
reels if it is to be returned to the Owner's warehouse on reels. The Bidder will retain possession of all jumpers, tie
wire, armor rods, connectors, and other conductor accessories removed. These items will not be returned to the Owner.
The removal unit for each size of conductor or cable is shown by the prefix I followed by D and the conductor or cable type;
thus an I-D-6ACWC signifies the removal unit for 1,000 feet of 6A Copperweld-copper conductor. 
d. Guys. All guys regardless of length, type of attachment, or size of guy strand are specified by the same unit; thus
an I-E signifies the removal of any guy. 
e. Anchors. Only anchor rods are to be removed by the Bidder in anchor removal units. The anchor will be left in the ground;
thus an I-F signifies the removal of any anchor rod. If the rod cannot be unscrewed, the end of the rod shall either
be cut off or bent down so that the rod will be at least 18 inches below ground. 
f. Transformers. The unit for removal of transformer assembly units is divided into two sections, (1) Conventional
Transformer Assembly, and (2) Self-Protected Transformer Assembly. Only one unit is specified for each type, and
all sizes of transformers from 1 to 25 kVA within each group will be covered by the same unit. ``Self-protected'' refers
to transformers where all protective equipment is mounted on or within the transformer. ``Conventional'' refers
to transformers where protective equipment is mounted separately from the transformer. The unit is designated by
the prefix I followed by the description of the unit to be removed; thus IG Conventional signifies the removal of a conventional
transformer assembly for any size transformer from 1 to 25 kVA. 
g. Secondary units. The unit for removal of secondary assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly
itself, all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of secondary conductor or cables where existing
secondary conductor or cable is to be reused. 
In addition, the unit for removal of the secondary assembly includes the handling or holding of any conductor at tap
lines where such is involved, and the reinstalling of such tap conductor in accordance with the specifications. 
h. Service unit. The unit for removal of service assemblies includes, in addition to the removal of the assembly itself,
all necessary handling such as untying, resagging, and retying of service conductor or cable where existing service
conductor or cable is to be reused.

XXXX

 ( 

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXXX

 ( 

XXXX

) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing
of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps
which shall not exceed 

XXXX

 in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line of poles carrying conductors. (See Detail A, Drawing
TM-12-2A.) The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the
ground line. (See Detail B, Drawing TM-12-2A.) All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way
shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing. (See Detail
C, Drawing 
TM-12-2A.) Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared
shall be omitted from the total measurement. All length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000 shall
give the number of 1,000-foot TM-12 units of clearing. The Bidder shall not remove or trim shade, fruit, or ornamental
trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing. 

TM-12 (1). This unit is identical with TM-12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet wide (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures). (See Detail D, Drawing TM-12-2A.) 

TMC-12, TMC-12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment
of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming. 

TM-13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer
will select those trees off the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Bidder
in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Bidder shall remove or top such trees at his option except that the
Bidder shall trim and not remove shade, fruit, or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer in writing.
(See Drawings TM-12-2A and TM-13 for examples of danger trees.)

The measurement of the length of clearing off the right-of-way shall be considered as a straight line parallel to the
horizontal line between poles or centerline of structures, such measurement of length to be based on maximum dimension
of foliage (not trunk) projected to the ground line. (See Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing TM-12-2A.) Dead
trees having no foliage shall be measured across the maximum dimension and multiplied by two. (See Detail F, Drawing
TM-12-2A.) Each tree so removed shall be added together to determine the total length of clearing. All
length thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000, shall give the number of TM-13 units. (Example:
Details E, F, G, and H, Drawing TM-12-2A, total .1 of a TM-13 unit.) 

TM-14. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXX

 (

XXX

XXX

 (

XXX

) feet on one side of right-of-way centerline) of actual clearing of right-of-way. Trees and underbrush should be
cleared from the ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark the trees and brush to be
cleared to provide ``undulating'' boundaries. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in the right-of-way to the
extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the access road. 
 
The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or
centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail
B, Drawing TM-12-2A.) All trees and underbrush cleared across the right-of-way shall be considered to

5. Manner of submitting proposals. Proposals and all supporting instruments must be submitted on the forms furnished
by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its
license number if a license is required by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope
in which the Proposal is submitted. Proposals must be filled in in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations
will be permitted, unless made before submission, and initialed and dated. 
6. Familiarity with conditions. Prior to the submission of the Proposal the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to
have made a careful examination of the site of the Project and of the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings,
and forms of Contractor's Proposal and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and with the Engineer,
and shall become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities,
the kind and character of soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and during the
construction of the Project, general local conditions and all other matters that may affect the cost and the time of
completion of the Project. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including
those pertaining to the licensing of contractors, and the so-called ``Kick-back Statute'' (48 Stat. 948) and regulations
issued pursuant thereto. 
7. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal. 
8. Alternate designs. The Owner reserves the right to confine its consideration of the several bids to one type of design
regardless of alternate types of design which may be specified in the Plans and Specifications and offered in the Proposals.

9. The Time for Completion of Construction of the Project shall be as specified by the Engineer in the Proposal. 
10. Bid bond. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is
a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent
(10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder agrees, provided its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, that, by
filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the owner's receiving and considering
such Proposals, said Proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such Bid Bond or check shall be held
by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond is furnished (where required) by the
successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60)
days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal
is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10)
days to the Bidder furnishing same. 
11. Contractor's bond. The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal
and, for a Contract in excess of $100,000, to furnish a Contractor's Bond in triplicate in the form attached hereto
with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than
the contract price. 
12. Failure to furnish contractor's bond. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to execute such counterparts
or to furnish a Contractor's Bond (where required) within ten (10) days after written notification of the acceptance
of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner
shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered
with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check, the difference (not exceeding the amount of
the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith
contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``Successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any
Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the counterparts
or to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (where required.) 
13. Contract is entire agreement. The Contract to be effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall be deemed to include
the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting
from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.

14. Minor irregularities. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal,
if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities
or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the Owner.

15. Balanced bid. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals. The attention of Bidders is specially
called to the desirability of a proper balance between prices for labor and materials and between the total prices
for the respective Construction Units. Lack of such balance may be considered as a reason for rejecting a Proposal.

16. Discrepancy in unit prices. Where the unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal are separated into three columns
designated as ``Labor,'' ``Materials'' and ``Labor and Materials,'' and where a discrepancy appears between the
sum shown in the ``Labor and Materials'' column and the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column
and the ``Materials'' column, the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column and the ``Materials''
column shall control.

17. Definition of terms. The terms 

Administrator, Engineer, Supervisor, Project, Completion of Construction 

and 

Completion of the Project 

as used throughout this Contract shall be as defined in Article VI, section 1, of the Contractor's Proposal. 

18. The Owner Represents: 

a. If by provisions of the Contractor's Proposal the Owner shall have undertaken to furnish any materials for the construction
of the Project, such materials are on hand at locations specified or if such materials are not on hand they will be made
available by the Owner to the successful Bidder at the locations specified before the time such materials are required
for construction. 

b. All easements and rights-of-way, except as shown on maps included in the Plans and Specifications, have been obtained
from the owners of the properties across which the Project is to be constructed (including tenants who may reasonably
be expected to object to such construction). The remaining easements and rights-of-way, if any, will be obtained
as required to avoid delay in construction. 

c. All staking, except as shown on the maps included in the Plans and Specifications, has been completed and sufficient
staking crews will be available to maintain stakes at all times in advance of construction. 

d. Prompt payment for the construction of the Project will be made with funds pursuant to the Loan Contract, or with
funds otherwise available to the Owner. 

If the Owner shall fail to comply with any of the undertakings contained in the foregoing representations or if any
of such representations shall be incorrect, the Bidder will be entitled to an extension of time of completion for a
period equal to the delay, if any, caused by the failure of the Owner to comply with such undertakings or by any such incorrect
representation; provided the Bidder shall have promptly notified the Owner in writing of its desire to extend the
time of completion in accordance with the foregoing; provided, however, that such extension, if any, of the time and
completion shall be the sole remedy of the Bidder for the Owner's failure, because of conditions beyond the control
and without the fault of the Owner, to furnish materials in accordance with subparagraph a hereof.

Section 1. Time and Manner of Construction 



a. The Bidder agrees to commence construction of the Project on a date (hereinafter called the ``Commencement Date'')
which shall be determined by the Engineer after notice in writing of approval of the Contract by the Administrator
and notice in writing from the Bidder that the Bidder has sufficient materials to warrant commencement and continuation
of construction, but in no event will the Commencement Date be later than 

XXXX 

 calendar days after date of approval of the Contract by the Administrator. The Bidder further agrees to prosecute
diligently and to complete construction in strict accordance with the Plans, Specifications and Construction Drawings
within 

XXXX 

 (

XXXX 

) calendar days (excluding Sundays) after Commencement Date: Provided, however, that the Bidder will not be required
to dig holes, set poles or install anchors if there are more than six (6) inches of frost in the ground nor to perform any
construction on such days when in the judgment of the Engineer snow, rain, or wind, or the results of snow, rain, or frost
make it impracticable to perform any operation of construction and to the extent of the time lost due to the conditions
described herein and approved in writing by the Engineer, the time of completion set out above will be extended if the
Bidder makes a written request therefor to the Owner as provided in subsection b of this section 1. 

b. The time for Completion of Construction shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively
to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including Acts of God, fires, floods, inability to
obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible:
Provided, however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10)
days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made
a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress
of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omissions of the Owner, shall result in any liability
on the part of the Owner. 

c. The sequence of construction shall be as set forth below, the numbers or names being the designations of extensions
or areas (hereinafter called the ``Sections'') corresponding to the numbers or names shown on the maps attached hereto,
or if no Sections are set forth below, the sequence of construction shall be as determined by the Bidder, subject to

d. The Owner, acting through the Engineer and with the approval of the Administrator,
 may from time to time during the progress of the construction of the Project make such changes in, additions to or subtractions
from the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings, List of Materials and sequence of construction provided
for in the previous paragraph which are part of the Contractor's Proposal as conditions may warrant: Provided, however,
that if any change in the construction to be done shall require an extension of time, a reasonable extension will be
granted if the Bidder shall make a written request therefor to the Owner within ten (10) days after any such change is
made. And provided further, that if the cost to the Bidder of construction of the Project shall be materially increased
by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Bidder for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Construction
Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator,
 but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall
have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or
addition. 






e. The Bidder will not perform any work hereunder on Sundays unless there is urgent need for such Sunday work and the
Owner consents thereto in writing. The time for completion specified in subsection a of this Section 1 shall not be
affected in any way by inclusion of this subsection nor by the Owner's consent or lack of consent to Sunday work hereunder.


Section 2. Environmental Protection. The Bidder shall perform work in such a manner as to maximize preservation of
beauty, conservation of natural resources and minimize marring and scarring of the landscape and silting of streams.
The Bidder shall not deposit trash in streams or waterways, and shall not deposit herbicides or other chemicals or
their containers in or near streams, waterways or pastures. The Bidder shall follow, under the general direction
of the Engineer, the criteria relating to environmental protection as specified herein by the Engineer. 

Section 3. The Bidder agrees that in the event this Proposal is accepted it will make available for use in connection
with the proposed construction all necessary tools and equipment and qualified superintendents and foremen. 

Section 4. Changes in Construction. The Bidder agrees to make such changes in construction previously installed
in the Project by the Bidder as required by the Owner for prices arrived at as follows: 

a. For substations and other units where only a portion of the complete unit is affected by the change, the compensation
for such change shall be as agreed upon in writing by the Bidder and the Owner and approved by the Administrator

3

 prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change. 





b. For all other units, the compensation for such change shall be the reasonable cost thereof as agreed upon in writing
by the Bidder and the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change, but in no event shall it
exceed two (2) times the labor price quoted in the Proposal for the installation of the unit to be changed. Such compensation
shall be in lieu of any other payment for the installation and removal of the original unit. (If a new or replacing unit
is installed, payment for such new or replacing unit shall be made as shown in the final inventory.) 

No payment shall be made to the Bidder for materials or labor involved in correcting errors or omissions on the part
of the Bidder which result in construction not in accordance with the Plans and Specifications. 

Section 5. Construction Not in Proposal. The Bidder also agrees that when it is necessary to construct units not shown
in the Proposal it will construct such units for a price arrived at as follows:

<TEXT>
 

a. The cost of materials shall be determined by the invoices. 

b. The cost of labor shall be the reasonable cost thereof, but in no event shall it exceed an amount determined by calculating
the ratio of the total labor costs to the total material costs in the section of the Proposal involved, and multiplying
the cost of materials for the unit in question by this ratio. 



Section 6. Supervision and Inspection



a. The Bidder shall cause the construction work on the Project to receive constant supervision by a competent superintendent
(hereinafter called the ``Superintendent'') who shall be present at all times during working hours where construction
is being carried on. The Bidder shall also employ, in connection with the construction of the Project, capable, experienced
and reliable foremen and such skilled workmen as may be required for the various classes of work to be performed. Directions
and instructions given to the Superintendent shall be binding upon the Bidder. 

b. The Owner reserves the right to require the removal from the Project of any employee of the Bidder if in the judgment
of the Owner such removal shall be necessary in order to protect the interest of the Owner. The Owner or the Supervisor,
if any, shall have the right to require the Bidder to increase the number of its employees and to increase or change the
amount or kind of tools and equipment if at any time the progress of the work shall be unsatisfactory to the Owner or Supervisor;
but the failure of the Owner or Supervisor to give any such directions shall not relieve the Bidder of its obligations
to complete the work within the time and in the manner specified in this Proposal. 

c. The manner of construction of the Project, and all materials and equipment used therein, shall be subject to the
inspection, tests and approval of the Owner and the Administrator, and the Bidder shall furnish all information required
by the Owner or by the Administrator concerning the nature or source of any materials incorporated or to be incorporated
in the Project. The Owner and the Administrator shall have the right to inspect all payrolls, invoices of materials,
and other data and records of the Bidder and of any subcontractor, relevant to the construction of the Project. The
Bidder shall provide all reasonable facilities necessary for such inspection and tests and shall maintain an office
at the site of the Project, with telephone service where obtainable and at least one office employee to whom directions
and instructions of the Owner may be delivered. Delivery of such directions or instructions in writing to the employee
of the Bidder at such office shall constitute delivery to the Bidder. The Bidder shall have an authorized agent accompany
the Engineer when final inspection is made and, if requested by the Owner, when any other inspection is made. 

d. In the event that the Owner, or the Administrator, shall determine that the construction contains or may contain
numerous defects, it shall be the duty of the Bidder and the Bidder's Surety or Sureties, if any, to have an inspection
made by an engineer approved by the Owner and the Administrator for the purpose of determining the exact nature, extent
and location of such defects. 

e. The Engineer may recommend to the Owner that the Bidder suspend the work wholly or in part for such period or periods
as the Engineer may deem necessary due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as are considered unfavorable
for the satisfactory prosecution of the work or because of the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of the Contract: Provided, however, that the Bidder shall not suspend work pursuant to this provision without written
authority from the Owner to do so. The time of completion hereinabove set forth shall be increased by the number of days
of any such suspension, except when such suspension is due to the failure of the Bidder to comply with any of the provisions
of this Contract. In the event that work is suspended by the Bidder with the consent of the Owner, the Bidder before resuming
work shall give the Owner at least twenty-four (24) hours notice thereof in writing. 



Section 7. Defective Materials and Workmanship



a. The acceptance of any materials, equipment (except owner furnished materials) or any workmanship by the Owner
or the Engineer shall not preclude the subsequent rejection thereof if such materials, equipment, or workmanship
shall be found to be defective after delivery or installation, and any such materials, equipment or workmanship found
defective before final acceptance of the construction shall be replaced or remedied, as the case may be, by and at the
expense of the Bidder. Any such condemned material or equipment shall be immediately removed from the site of the Project
by the Bidder at the Bidder's expense. The Bidder shall not be entitled to any payment hereunder so long as any defective
materials, equipment or workmanship in respect to the Project, of which the Bidder shall have had notice, shall not
have been replaced or remedied, as the case may be.

b. Notwithstanding any certificate which may have been given by the Owner or the Engineer, if any materials, equipment
(except owner-furnished materials) or any workmanship which does not comply with the requirements of this Contract
shall be discovered within one (1) year after Completion of Construction of the Project, the Bidder shall replace
such defective materials or equipment or remedy any such defective workmanship within thirty (30) days after notice
in writing of the existence thereof shall have been given by the Owner. If the Bidder shall be called upon to replace
any defective materials or equipment or to remedy defective workmanship as herein provided, the Owner, if so requested
by the Bidder shall deenergize that section of the Project involved in such work. In the event of failure by the Bidder
to do so, the Owner may replace such defective materials or equipment or remedy such defective workmanship, as the
case may be, and in such event the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the cost and expense thereof. 



ARTICLE III_PAYMENTS AND RELEASE OF LIENS

Section 1. Payments to Bidder 



a. Within the first fifteen (15) days of each calendar month, the Owner shall make partial payment to the Bidder for
construction accomplished during the preceding calendar month on the basis of completed Assembly Units furnished
and certified to by the Bidder, recommended by the Engineer and approved by the Owner solely for the purposes of payment:
Provided, however, that such approval shall not be deemed approval of the workmanship or materials. Only ninety percent
(90%) of each such estimate approved during the construction of the Project shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder
prior to Completion of the Project: Provided, however, that at any time after work, which, in the sole determination
of the Engineer, amounts to fifty percent (50%) of the Maximum Contract Price has been completed, the Owner may elect,
in lieu of paying ninety percent (90%) of each such subsequent estimate, to pay each such subsequent estimate in full.
Upon completion by the Bidder of the construction of the Project, the Engineer will prepare a Final Inventory of the
Project showing the total number and character of Assembly Units and, after checking such Inventory with the Bidder,
will certify it to the Owner, together with a certificate of the total cost of the construction performed. Upon the
approval of such certificates by the Owner and the Administrator, the Owner shall make payment to the Bidder of all
amounts to which the Bidder shall be entitled thereunder which shall not have been paid: Provided, however, that such
final payment shall be made not later than ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project,
as specified in the Certificate of Completion, unless withheld because of the fault of the Bidder. 

b. The Bidder shall be paid on the basis of the number of Construction Units actually installed at the direction of the
Owner shown by the inventory based on the staking sheets or structure lists; Provided, however, that the total cost
shall not exceed the maximum Contract price for the construction of the Project as set forth in the Acceptance, unless
such excess shall have been approved in writing by the Administrator. 

c. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1a above, the Bidder may, by giving written notice thereof to the Owner,
elect to receive payment in full for any Section of the Project upon: 

(1) completion of construction of such Section as certified by the Engineer and approved by the Owner and the Administrator;


(2) submission to the Owner and the Administrator of the releases of lien and the certificate referred to in Section
2 hereof; 

(3) approval by the Owner and the Administrator of the inventory in respect of such section; and

the control of the Bidder. The due date for purposes of such monthly payment shall be the fifteenth day of each calendar
month provided (1) the Bidder on or before the fifth day of such month shall have submitted its certification of Construction
Units completed during the preceding month and (2) the Owner on or before the fifteenth day of such month shall have
approved such certification. If, for reasons not due to the Bidder's fault, such approval shall not have been given
on or before the fifteenth day of such month, the due date for purposes of this subsection d shall be the fifteenth day
of such month notwithstanding the absence of the approval of the certification. 





e. Interest at the rate of 

XXXX

 percent

5

 (

XXXX

%) per annum shall be paid by the Owner to the Bidder on the final payment for the Project or any completed Section thereof,
commencing fifteen (15) days after the due date. The due date for purposes of such final payment shall be the date of
approval by the Administrator of all of the documents requiring such approval, as a condition precedent to the making
of final payment, or ninety (90) days after the date of Completion of Construction of the Project, as specified in the
Certificate of Completion, whichever date is earlier. 





f. No payment shall be due while the Bidder is in default in respect of any of the provisions of this Contract and the Owner
may withhold from the Bidder the amount of any claim by a third party against either the Bidder or the Owner based upon
an alleged failure of the Bidder to perform the work hereunder in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.


Section 2. Release of Liens and Certificate of Contractor. (See sample REA Form 224, Waiver and Release of Lien and
sample REA Form 231, Certificate of Contractor.) Upon the completion by the Bidder of the Project (or any Section thereof
if the Bidder shall elect to receive payment in full for any Section when completed as provided above) but prior to final
payment to the Bidder, the Bidder shall deliver to the Owner, in duplicate, releases of all liens and of rights to claim
any lien, in the form attached hereto from all manufacturers, materialmen, and subcontractors furnishing services
or materials for the Project or such Section and a certificate in the form attached hereto to the effect that all labor
used on or for the Project or such Section has been paid and that all such releases have been submitted to the Owner for

damages to the Project or any portion thereof under the control of the Bidder by reason of any Act of God or other casualty
or cause whether or not the same shall have occurred by reason of the Bidder's negligence. 

(i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors,
officers, and employees from all claims, causes of action, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees) for personal loss, injury, or death to persons (including but not limited to Bidder's employees)
and loss, damage to or destruction of Owner's property or the property of any other person or entity (including but
not limited to Bidder's property) in any manner arising out of or connected with the Contract, or the materials or equipment
supplied or services performed by Bidder, its subcontractors and suppliers of any tier. But nothing herein shall
be construed as making Bidder liable for any injury, death, loss, damage, or destruction caused by the sole negligence
of Owner. 

(ii) To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bidder shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner and Owner's directors,
officers, and employees from all liens and claims filed or asserted against Owner, its directors, officers, and employees,

or otherwise, Owner shall have the right (but shall not be obligated) to pay all sums necessary to obtain any such discharge
or release and to deduct all amounts so paid from the amount due Bidder. 

(iii) Bidder shall provide to Owner's satisfaction evidence of Bidder's ability to comply with the indemnification
provisions of subparagraphs i and ii above, which evidence may include but may not be limited to a bond or liability
insurance policy obtained for this purpose through a licensed surety or insurance company. 

g. Any and all excess earth, rock, debris, underbrush and other useless material shall be removed by the Bidder from
the site of the Project as rapidly as practicable as the work progresses. 

h. Upon violation by the Bidder of any of the provisions of this Section, after written notice of such violation given
to the Bidder by the Engineer or the Owner, the Bidder shall immediately correct such violation. Upon failure of the
Bidder so to do the Owner may correct such violation at the Bidder's expense:

of any of the terms of this Proposal, the Owner, without in any manner limiting its legal and equitable remedies in the
circumstances, may serve upon the Bidder and the Surety or Sureties, if any, upon the Contractor's Bond or Bonds a written
notice requiring the Bidder to cause such default to be corrected forthwith. Unless within twenty (20) days after
the service of such notice upon the Bidder such default shall be corrected or arrangements for the correction thereof
satisfactory to both the Owner and the Administrator shall be made by the Bidder or its Surety or Sureties, if any, the
Owner may take over the construction of the Project and prosecute the same to completion by Contract or otherwise for
the account and at the expense of the Bidder, and the Bidder and its Surety or Sureties, if any, shall be liable to the
Owner for any cost or expense in excess of the Contract price occasioned thereby. In such event the Owner may take possession
of and utilize, in completing the construction of the Project, any materials, tools, supplies, equipment, appliances,
and plant belonging to the Bidder or any of its subcontractors, which may be situated at the site of the Project. The
Owner in such contingency may exercise any rights, claims or demands which the Bidder may have against third persons
in connection with this Contract and for such purpose the Bidder does hereby assign, transfer and set over unto the
Owner all such rights, claims and demands. 
Section 2. Liquidated Damages. The time of the Completion of Construction of the Project is of the essence of the Contract.
Should the Bidder neglect, refuse or fail to complete the construction within the time herein agreed upon, after giving
effect to extensions of time, if any, herein provided, then, in that event and in view of the difficulty of estimating
with exactness damages caused by such delay, the Owner shall have the right to deduct from and retain out of such moneys
which may be then due, or which may become due and payable to the Bidder the sum of 

XXXX

 dollars (

XXXX

) per day for each and every day that such construction is delayed in its completion beyond the specified time, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty; if the amount due and to become due from the Owner to the Bidder is insufficient to pay in
full any such liquidated damages, the Bidder shall pay to the Owner the amount necessary to effect such payment in full;
Provided, however, that the Owner shall promptly notify the Bidder in writing of the manner in which the amount retained,
deducted or claimed as liquidated damages was computed. 
Section 3. Cumulative Remedies. Every right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Owner or the Government
or the Administrator shall be cumulative, shall be in addition to every right and remedy now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or by statute and the pursuit of any right or remedy shall not be construed as an election: Provided,
however, that the provisions of Section 2 of this Article shall be the exclusive measure of damages for failure by the
Bidder to complete the construction of the Project within the time herein agreed upon.

Section 7_Right-of-Way Clearing Units 


TM-12. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on one side of pole line or centerline of structures) of actual clearing of right-of-way. This includes clearing
of underbrush, tree removal, and such tree trimming as is required so that the right-of-way, except for tree stumps
which shall not exceed 

XXXX

 in height, shall be clear from the ground up on one side of the line of poles carrying conductors (See Detail A, Drawing
TM-12-2A.) The length of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line, parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the
ground line (See Detail B, Drawing TM-12-2A.) All trees and underbrush across the width of the right-of-way
shall be considered to be grouped together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail
C, Drawing TM-12-2A.) Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush
cleared shall be omitted from the total measurement. All lengths thus arrived at, added together and divided by 1,000
shall give the number of TM-12 units of clearing. The Bidder shall not remove or trim shade, fruit, or ornamental
trees unless so directed by the Engineer in writing. 
TM-12 (1). This unit is identical with TM-12, except the full width of the right-of-way to be cleared shall
be 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet wide (to be measured 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet on each side of the pole line or centerline of structures) (See Detail D, Drawing TM-12-2A.) 
TM-13. The unit, for purpose of quoting, is 1,000 feet in length of clearing off the right-of-way. The Engineer
will select those trees off the right-of-way that he deems to be a hazard to the line and will designate them to the Bidder
in writing as danger trees. When so designated, the Bidder shall remove or top such trees at his option except that the
Bidder shall trim and not remove shade, fruit or ornamental trees unless otherwise directed by the Engineer in writing
(See Drawings TM-12-2A and TM-13 for examples of danger trees.) 
The measurement of length of right-of-way to be cleared shall be considered as a straight line parallel to the horizontal
line between poles or centerline of structures, such measurement of length to be based on maximum dimension of foliage
(not trunk) projected to the ground line (See Details E, F, G and H, Drawing TM-12-2A.) Dead trees having
no foliage shall be measured across the maximum dimension and multiplied by two. (See Detail F, Drawing TM-12-2A.)
Each tree so removed shall be added together to determine the total length of clearing. All lengths thus arrived at,
added together and divided by 1,000 shall give the number of TM-13 units (Example: Details E, F, G and H, Drawing
TM-12-2A, total 0.10 of a TM-13 unit.) 
TMC-12, TMC-12 (1). These units are identical to the respective TM units except that chemical treatment
of stumps is required in addition to the clearing of underbrush, tree removal and tree trimming. 
TM-14. The unit is 1,000 feet in length and 

XXXX

 (

XXXX

) feet in width (to be measured feet on one side of right-of-way center line) of actual clearing of right-of-way. Trees
and underbrush should be cleared from the ground up within 10 feet of any structure location. The Engineer will mark
the trees and brush to be cleared to provide ``undulating'' boundaries. Low growing trees and brush are to be left in
the right-of-way to the extent it will not be hazardous to the line or will not interfere with the service road. The length
of actual clearing shall be measured in a straight line parallel to the horizontal line between poles or center line
of structures and across the maximum dimension of foliage cleared projected to the ground line (See Detail B, Drawing
TM-12-2A.) All trees and underbrush cleared across the right-of-way shall be considered to be grouped
together as a single length in measuring the total length of clearing (See Detail C, Drawing TM-12-2A.)
Spaces along the right-of-way in which no trees are to be removed or trimmed or underbrush cleared shall be omitted
from the total measurement.

Section 8_Substation Assembly Units 


Description of Construction Units. Each Construction Unit consists of a complete installation of the designated
portion of a substation as specified on the drawings, together with connections to associated equipment. Each Construction
Unit represents all labor and material including necessary accessories completely installed and tested in satisfactory
operation. Full identification of each Construction Unit and all necessary specifications of the installation
is shown on the drawings. 
Items of material in each Construction Unit shall be of the designated size, rating, type, voltage, or other specification
in accordance with the drawings. The bill of material drawing for each substation shows the identification of the
Construction Units under which the material is to be installed and shows which items of material may be partly or entirely
found in the lists of owner-furnished materials. 
All items of equipment, unless otherwise specified, are mounted on a structure which shall be a Construction Unit
of Group A. Each Construction Unit is designated by the letter of the Group to which it belongs and an identifying number.
The same item of equipment carries the same Construction Unit designation in all the substations. Items of equipment
designated by the same Construction Unit in one substation are of only one kind as to voltage, type and other specifications.

The tabulation of construction units for each substation is separate and contains all units necessary for construction
of that substation.
