<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Survey of American Indian and Alaska Native Government Administrative Records.


Form Number(s): 

AIANAR.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

188 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

569.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

20 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Census Bureau plans to conduct the Survey of American Indian and Alaska Native Government Administrative Records
as part of a program of research and development (R&D) to assist in formulating policy and design options for the
Year 2000 Decennial Census. A major part of this R&D is the investigation of the potential of administrative records
to improve coverage in the census. The use of American Indian and Alaska Native government administrative records
has the potential to improve coverage by reducing the coverage differential on reservations and trust lands and improving
coverage in Alaska Native villages. All Federally-recognized tribal governments will be contacted to provide information
about their administrative records. The records themselves will not be obtained as part of the survey. Data collection
for this survey will be conducted under contract by Westat, Inc. Information gathered in this survey will help to determine
whether administrative records held by tribal governments would be effective in improving coverage in the Year 2000
Decennial Census.


Affected Public: 

State or local governments.


Frequency: 

One time only.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Mandatory.


OMB Desk Officer:

DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

1995 Census Test - Prelist.


Form Number(s): 

DG-101A, DG-101B, DG-169.


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

1,340 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

52,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

1.5 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Census Bureau is planning to test various methods for address list compilation and update in conjunction with
the 1995 Census Test. The Census Bureau uses two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass
and prelist. In the urban test areas, the Census Bureau will create a Master Address File (MAF) by extracting addresses
from the Census Bureau's 1990 Address Control File (ACF) and updating the extract using the United States Postal Service
Delivery Sequence File. Then the Census Bureau will update the address list during the precanvass operation. For
the rural test sites, the Census Bureau will create an address file through a prelist operation; the address list will
be used in the subsequent update/leave operation to deliver the census questionnaires. During prelist, census enumerators
canvass an area and list all housing units within the assigned area. The prelist operation is designed to identify
and collect complete physical location address, mailing address, and name of householder for all living quarters.
This will enable an enumerator to return to the living quarters to update the address and to deliver a questionnaire
during the update/leave operation. It will also provide the information needed to conduct the local government review
of the census address list.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

One-time only.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Mandatory.

Needs and Uses: 

The Bureau of the Census plans to conduct the National Training Survey (NTS) for the Center for Educational Quality
of the Workforce (EQW), a group of social scientists funded by the National Center for Education Statistics to study
the workplace in America. The NTS will provide unique information on employer-provided training by identifying
relationships between the training and economic characteristics of the establishment. The EQW will incorporate
the results of this survey into a larger five-year examination of the American workplace and will coordinate
its efforts with similar studies and groups in other countries and with the World Bank. This examination will provide
planners and policy-makers in government and the private sector with information on how our workforce compares
and competes with other countries in South America and the Far East. The Census Bureau will also study ways of incorporating
establishment data gathered in the NTS into our Longitudinal Research Database.

Needs and Uses: 

In October 1993, the Census Bureau, with approval from OMB, surveyed all members of Congress to determine how we can
better meet their needs for Census Bureau data. We are requesting OMB clearance to conduct a similar survey of Congressional
committees/subcommittees. The survey will identify which committees/subcommittees use our data, which do not
want any census data, and which would like a briefing on how to use Census Bureau data. This information is needed to
determine how the Census Bureau can revise and improve the current program it uses to disseminate data to committees/subcommittees
of Congress. This information will enable us to provide committees/subcommittees of Congress only the data for which
they have a specific need, and will reduce the amount of data currently being sent that is not being used.

Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone_Palm Beach County, FL; Application and Public Hearing 



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Palm Beach County Department
of Airports, on behalf of the Board of Commissioners of the County of Palm Beach, Florida, requesting authority to
establish a general-purpose foreign-trade zone at sites in Palm Beach County, within the West Palm Beach Customs
port of entry. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 23, 1994. The applicant
is authorized to make the proposal under Section 288.36, Florida Statutes Annotated (1991). 
The proposed zone would be the second general-purpose zone in the West Palm Beach Customs port of entry area. The existing
zone, FTZ 135, is located at the Port of Palm Beach (Grantee: Port of Palm Beach, Board Order 348, 52 FR 9903, 3/27/87).

The proposed foreign-trade zone would consist of sites (306 acres) at the Palm Beach International Airport and at
the new North Palm Beach County Airport, both located in Palm Beach County, Florida. 

Site 1 

(24 acres) is at the Palm Beach International Airport, and includes the Air Cargo Facility (Site 1a-3 acres); a proposed
air cargo facility (Site 1b-5 acres); and a future industrial park type site (Site 1c-16 acres). 

Site 2 

(282 acres-3 parcels) is at the North Palm Beach County Airport, Beeline Highway and Route 786. The sites are owned
by Palm Beach County. 

The application contains evidence of the need for additional zone services in the Palm Beach County area. Several
firms have indicated an interest in using zone procedures within the proposed project for warehousing/distribution
of such items as 
electronic components, peripherals of data processing machines, lock components and ceramic tile. Specific manufacturing
approvals are not being sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis. 
In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790-50808, 10-8-91), a member of the FTZ Staff
has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board. 
As part of the investigation, the Commerce examiner will hold a public hearing on June 23, 1994, at 9 a.m., in the Thomas
McCaddy Room, 12th Floor, Governmental Center, 301 N. Olive Avenue, West Palm Beach, Florida. 

Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall
be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The 
closing period for their receipt is August 2, 1994. Rebuttal comments in response to material submitted during the
foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to August 17, 1994). 

A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available during this time for public inspection at the
following locations:

Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review Gray Portland Cement and Clinker From Mexico



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

International Trade Administration/Import Administration/Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of preliminary results of antidumping duty administrative review.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on gray portland
cement and clinker from Mexico. The review covers exports of this merchandise to the United States during the period
August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993, and one firm, CEMEX, S.A. The results of this review indicate the existence of
dumping margins for the period.



We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On August 3, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41239) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' for the August 1, 1992, through July 31,
1993, period of review (POR) of the antidumping duty order on gray portland cement and clinker from Mexico (55 FR 35371,
August 29, 1990). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22, CEMEX, S.A. (CEMEX) and the petitioners, the Ad Hoc Committee of
AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement and the National Cement Co. of California, Inc.,
requested a review. On September 30, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping Review''
for CEMEX (58 FR 51053). Thus, the Department is now conducting a review of this respondent pursuant to section 751
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). 



Scope of Review



The products covered by this review include gray portland cement and clinker. Gray portland cement is a hydraulic
cement and the primary component of concrete. Clinker, an intermediate material product produced when manufacturing
cement, has no use other than of being ground into finished cement. Gray portland cement is currently classifiable
under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 2523.29, and cement clinker is currently classifiable under
number 2523.10. Gray portland cement has also been entered under number 2523.90 as ``other hydraulic cements.''
The HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service (the Customs Service) purposes only. The
written description remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. 



Best Information Available 



On October 14, 1993, we sent CEMEX a standard antidumping questionnaire which instructed CEMEX to report U.S. sales
and home market sales of such or similar merchandise. 

In a letter dated November 16, 1993, CEMEX requested that it be excused from reporting home market sales of Type I cement,
merchandise similar but not identical to Type II and Type V cement. CEMEX noted that during the POR it had sold only Type
II and Type V cement in the United States, and stated that it had sufficient home market sales of these types of cement
in the home market for a fair value comparison. CEMEX argued that, in accordance with statutory requirements and the
Department's practice, fair value comparisons should, wherever possible, be based upon sales of identical merchandise,
and therefore there was no need to report home market sales of Type I cement. 

In a letter dated November 29, 1993, we denied CEMEX's request. We noted that in the second administrative review,
covering the period August 1, 1991, through July 31, 1992, we had found that CEMEX's home market sales of Type II and
Type V cement had not been made in the ordinary course of trade and we had disregarded those sales for comparison purposes.
We noted that, given such a finding in a previous review, it was possible that a similar situation might exist with regard
to home market sales of Type II and Type V cement in the instant review. We therefore required CEMEX to report home market
sales of Type I cement. 

On January 10, 1994, CEMEX responded to our standard questionnaire. In its response, CEMEX did not provide the required
information regarding home market sales of Type I cement. Rather, CEMEX argued that in its view its home market sales
of Type II and Type V cement had always been made in the ordinary course of trade, and constituted sufficient basis for
a fair value comparison. 

On February 4, 1994, we issued a supplementary questionnaire to CEMEX that, among other things, reiterated the requirement
that CEMEX report its home market sales of Type I cement. We emphasized that these sales relevant to CEMEX's claim that
its home market sales of Type II and Type V cement had been made in the ordinary course of trade during the period of the
third review. We noted in the cover letter that lack or incompleteness of response might result in our relying on best
information available (BIA).

On March 1, 1994, CEMEX responded to our supplementary questionnaire. Again, CEMEX failed to report its home market
sales of Type I cement. CEMEX reiterated its contention that its sales of identical merchandise satisfied all statutory
criteria for use in calculating foreign market value (FMV). CEMEX argued that there was not yet any evidence on the
record of the instant review to refute this contention, and that it was not incumbent on CEMEX to establish that its
home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were made in the ordinary course of trade CEMEX stated that, given its position
it was not willing to incur the expense necessary to provide complete Type I cement sales data.

Given the Department's finding that home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were made outside the ordinary course
of trade in the period of the second review, we have been concerned about the possibility that CEMEX's home market sales
of type II and Type V cement might also have been made outside the ordinary course of trade during the instant POR.

Section 773(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act and section 353.46(a) of the Department's regulations provide that FMV shall
be based on the price at which ``such or similar merchandise'' is sold in the exporting country in the ``ordinary course
of trade for home consumption''. Section 771(15) of the Tariff Act defines ``ordinary course of trade'' as ``the conditions
and practices which, for a reasonable time prior to the exportation of the merchandise which is the subject of an investigation,
have been normal in the trade under consideration with respect to merchandise of the same class or kind'' (see also
19 CFR 353.46(b)).

In the previous review, 

i.e.,

 the second review, where CEMEX reported home market sales of Type I, Type II, Type V cement, petitioners made an allegation
that CEMEX's have market sales of Type II and Type V cement were outside the ordinary course of trade. In the final results
of the second review we compared CEMEX's home market sales of Type II and Type V cement with sales of similar merchandise
(namely, Type I cement) within the same class or kind.

Based on this comparison and on other factors raised by petitioners, we concluded in the second review that CEMEX's
home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were not made in the ordinary course of trade, and we did not use them for
the purposes of calculating FMV (See Gray Portland Cement and Clinker for Mexico: Final Results of Antidumping Duty
Administrative Review; 58 FR 47253 (September 8, 1993)).

Based on this finding, we believe that it is necessary to compare Type II and Type V cement sales with Type I cement sales
to determine whether the same conditions existed during the instant review, 

i.e.,

 the third review. However, after several requests for information, CEMEX has not reported Type I cement sales data
that would permit such a comparison.



Preliminary Results of Review



While CEMEX argues that it is not incumbent upon it to provide the Type I cement sales data, its refusal to provide essential
information has prevented the Department from determining whether home market sales of Type II and Type V cement were
sold in the ordinary course of trade. Therefore, we must resort to the use of BIA, is accordance with section 776(c)
of the Traffic Act. For a detailed analysis of this issue, see the Memorandum from the Office Director to the Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Compliance, dated May 18, 1994, which is on file in room B-099 of the Department's main
building.

As for the choice of BIA, we note that we have an established ``two-tier'' system:

1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes the proceedings, we
use as BIA the higher of (a) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the
same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative review or (b) the highest
rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind or merchandise in the same country of origin.

2. When a company substantially cooperated with our request for information, but failed to provide the information
requested in a timely manner or in the form required, we use as BIA the higher of (a) the highest rate (including the ``all
others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from either the LTFV investigation
or a prior administrative review, or (b) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the class or kind
of merchandise from the same country of origin.

See Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From France, 

et. al.

; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, 57 FR 28360, 28379 (June 24, 1992). In this case, we are
using first-tier BIA because CEMEX was uncooperative. The BIA rate is the highest of the rates found for any firm for
the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin in the LTFV investigation, 

i.e.,

 CEMEX's rate of 60.33 percent (55 FR 29244, July 18, 1990). Thus, as a result of our review, we preliminarily determine
the dumping margin for CEMEX for the period August 1, 1992, through July 31, 1993, to be 60.33 percent.

Case briefs and/or written comments from interested parties may be submitted no later than 30 days after the date of
publication of this notice. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in the case
briefs and comments, may be filed no later than 37 days after the date of publication of this notice. 

Within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice, interested parties to this proceeding may request a disclosure
and/or a hearing. The hearing, if requested, will take place no later than 44 days after publication of this notice.
Persons interested in attending the hearing should ascertain with the Department the date and time of the hearing.


The Department will subsequently publish the final results of this administrative review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or a hearing. 

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion
of this review. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of review,
as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be the rate
determined in the final results of review; (2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above,
the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the
exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a prior review, or the original LTFV investigation, but the manufacturer
is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise;
and (4) the cash deposit rate for all other manufacturers or exporters will be 59.91 percent, as explained below. 

On May 25, 1993, the CIT in Floral Trade Council v. United States, 822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and Federal-Mogul v. United
States, 839 F. Supp. 864 (CIT 1993), determined that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can
only be changed through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these
decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate
as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping
duty orders for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. 

Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for this order will be 59.91
percent, which was the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice of the LTFV investigation by the Department
(55 FR 29244, July 18, 1990). 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review. 

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of report availability and request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 7, 1993, NMFS made a determination that the eastern North Pacific (California) stock of gray whale (

Eschrictius

 

robustus

) had recovered and should be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (List) under the Endangered
Species Act (ESA). Section 4(g) requires NMFS to implement a system to monitor the status, for at least 5 years, of any
species that has recovered and is removed from the List. This notice announces the availability of the draft Gray Whale
Research and Monitoring Plan (Plan), that was prepared under section 4(g) of the ESA, for review and comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




NMFS issued a proposed determination on November 22, 1991 (56 FR 58869) that the California population of gray whales
should be removed from the List. After a 104-day comment period, NMFS issued a final determination on January 7, 1993
(58 FR 3121).
Under section 4(a) of the ESA, NMFS has the responsibility to monitor the status of the California gray whale for a period
of at least 5 years following delisting. The purpose of monitoring populations following delisting is to evaluate
the validity of the status determination used in the delisting process and to determine whether the status of the population
has deteriorated within a 5-year period subsequent to delisting. If at any time during this period NMFS finds that
the species' well-being is at risk, the ESA (section 4(b)(7)) requires NMFS to issue emergency protective regulations
to ensure the conservation of the species.
NMFS is making available for comment its proposed Plan. The Plan was developed by the staff of the National Marine Mammal
Laboratory in coordination with the NMFS Gray Whale Monitoring Task Group, which is composed of scientists and managers
who have specific responsibilities for coordinating activities involving gray whales. The Task Group was asked
to develop a plan, monitor research activities after the plan is implemented, and also to serve as a quick response
advisory team in the event of any catastrophic event affecting gray whales.
The following research is recommended for the first 5-year monitoring plan, in order of priority:
(1) Estimation of abundance from biennial surveys (or other appropriate sampling period) during the southbound
migration;
(2) Estimation of calf production during the northbound migration;
(3) Determination of potential biases in methods used to estimate abundance and calf production;
(4) Determination of trends in pregnancy rates from animals taken in any subsistence harvests that may be conducted
by Russia on behalf of its natives in Siberian Arctic;
(5) Estimation of the number of animals killed in any subsistence harvests that may be conducted by Russia on behalf
of its natives in Siberian Arctic;
(6) Use of Bayesian synthesis to evaluate current status of the population;
(7) Determination of the degree to which anthropogenic factors (e.g., chemical contaminants, marine noise) may
compromise the viability of this population (including its habitat).

Solid Waste Management Facility, Andersen AFB, Guam; Notice of Availability 
Draft Environmental Impact Statement 




The United States Air Force announces the availability of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the construction
of a new solid waste management facility at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The new facility will provide for recycling,
composting, and disposal of asbestos, rubble (hardfill), and municipal solid waste. The purpose of the proposed
action is to manage the solid waste generated by Andersen AFB (12,000 tons per year) after the existing on-base unlined
landfill reaches capacity in approximately 2 years. The preferred alternative for municipal solid waste disposal
is vertical expansion of the existing landfill. The proposed action is considered an interim measure, designed not
to exceed 10 years, to accommodate Air Force needs until an island-wide solid waste management system can be implemented;
however, the proposed action does have the capability for limited extension in the event that an island-wide system
does not become available at the end of 10 years. Specifically, it is proposed that a new landfill be constructed on
top of the existing one in such a manner that the liner system for the new facility will serve as a cap for the old facility.
Provisions will be made for the collection, removal, and treatment of leachate, and for groundwater monitoring.
Other alternatives considered include: a new landfill constructed at one of seven alternate sites on Andersen AFB,
use of the Government of Guam Ordot Landfill, use of a proposed Government of Guam waste-to-energy facility, future
use of an island-wide Government of Guam and Department of Defense landfill, incineration on base, use of the Navy
landfill at the Apra Harbor Complex, and no action. 
Two major environmental issues affect the selection of a preferred alternative. First, the majority of Andersen
Air Force Base overlies the Northern Guam Lens, which has been designated a sole source aquifer under the Safe Drinking
Water Act. The Guam Environmental Protection Agency has established a groundwater protection zone that constrains
activities in areas overlying the aquifer or serving as recharge zones. Second, the forested area along the cliffline
on the east, north, and west boundaries of Andersen Air Force Base is habitat for endangered species. The primary endangered
species of concern are the Mariana crow and the Mariana fruit bat. The principal threat to these species is predation
on eggs and young by an introduced species, the brown tree snake. The proposed action includes engineering controls
(a double liner with leachate collection, removal, and treatment) to minimize the likelihood of impacts to the aquifer.
Furthermore, by capping the existing landfill, the proposed action will reduce the production of leachate from previously
landfilled materials. Potential effects on the biota, and endangered species in particular, are unlikely because
the proposed action will take place at a site that is already disturbed and has minimal habitat value. 
The United States Air Force invites comments and suggestions from all interested parties on the findings of the Environmental
Impact Statement, and has tentatively scheduled a public hearing for May 1994. Notice of the exact time and place of
the hearing will be published in the news media. If concerned persons are not able to attend the public hearing, written
comments and suggestions will be accepted. To ensure that the Air Force will have sufficient time to fully consider
public contributions, written comments must be received no later than forty-five (45) days from the publication
of today's notice. Comments or requests for further information concerning this Environmental Impact Statement
should be addressed to Mr. Roy N. Tsutsui, Chief, Environmental Flight, Andersen AFB, Guam, 633 CES/CEV, Bldg. 18001,

action:

 Notice; recommendation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board has made a recommendation to the Secretary of Energy pursuant to 42 U.S.C.
2286a concerning improved schedule for remediation in the defense nuclear facilities complex. The Board requests
public comments on this recommendation.





</SUMMARY>
<SIGNER>
John T. Conway, 


</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Chairman.



Improved Schedule for Remediation in the Defense Nuclear Facilities Complex



The halt in production of nuclear weapons and materials to be used in nuclear weapons froze the manufacturing pipeline
in a state that, for safety reasons, should not be allowed to persist unremediated. The Board has concluded from observations
and discussions with others that imminent hazards could arise within two to three years unless certain problems are
corrected. 

We are especially concerned about specific liquids and solids containing fissile materials and other radioactive
substances in spent fuel storage pools, reactor basins, reprocessing canyons, processing lines, and various buildings
once used for processing and weapons manufacture. 

It is not clear at this juncture how fissile materials produced for defense purposes will eventually be dealt with
long term. What is clear is that the extant fissile materials and related materials require treatment on an accelerated
basis to convert them to forms more suitable for safe interim storage. 

The Board is especially concerned about the following situations:

 Several large tanks in the F-Canyon at the Savannah River Site contain tens of thousands of gallons of solutions
of plutonium and trans-plutonium isotopes. The trans-plutonium solutions remain from californium-252 products;
they include highly radioactive isotopes of americium and curium. These tanks, their appendages, and vital support
systems are old, subject to deterioration, prone to leakage, and are not seismically qualified. If an earthquake
or other accident were to breach the tanks, F-Canyon would become so contaminated that cleanup would be practically
impossible. Containment of the radioactive material under such circumstances would be highly uncertain.

 The K-East Basin at the Hanford Site contains hundreds of tons of deteriorating irradiated nuclear fuel from
the N-Reactor. This fuel has been heavily corroded during its long period of storage under water, and the bottom of
the basin is now covered by a thick deposit of sludge containing antinide compounds and fission products. The basin
is near the Columbia River. It has leaked on several occasions, is likely to leak again, and has design and construction
defects that make it seismically unsafe.

<TEXT>
 

 The 603 Basin at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) contains deteriorating irradiated reactor
fuel from a number of sources. This basin also contains sludge from corrosion of the reactor fuel. The seismic competence
of the 603 Basin is not established.

 Processing canyons and reactor basins at the Savannah River Site contain large amounts of deteriorating irradiated
reactor fuel stored under conditions similar to those at the 603 Basin at INEL.

 There are thousands of containers of plutonium-bearing liquids and solids at the Rocky Flats Plant, the Hanford
Site, the Savannah River Site, and the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These materials were in the nuclear-weapons-manufacturing
pipeline when manufacturing ended. Large quantities of plutonium solutions are stored in deteriorating tanks,
piping, and plastic bottles. Thousands of containers at the Rocky Flats Plant hold miscellaneous plutonium-bearing
materials classed as ``residuals'', some of which are chemically unstable. Many of the containers of plutonium metal
also contain plastic and, in some at the Rocky Flats Plant, the plastic is believed to be in intimate contact with the
plutonium. It is well known that plutonium in contact with plastic can cause formation of hydrogen gas and pyrophoric
plutonium compounds leading to a high probability of plutonium fires.

We note that removal of fissile materials from the 603 Basin at INEL has begun. We are also following the plans for remedying
several of the other situations listed. In general these plans are at an early stage. In addition, we are aware of steps
DOE has taken to assess spent fuel inventories and vulnerabilities. We also note that a number of environmental assessments
are being conducted in relation to the situations we have listed above. Finally, we note that a draft DOE Standard has
been prepared for methods to be used in safe storage of plutonium metal and plutonium oxide.

These actions notwithstanding, the Board is concerned about the slow pace of remediation. The Board believes that
additional delays in stabilizing these materials will be accompanied by further deterioration of safety and unnecessary
increased risks to workers and the public.

Therefore the Board recommends:

(1) That an integrated program plan be formulated on a high priority basis, to convert within two to three years the
materials addressed in the specific recommendations below, to forms or conditions suitable for safe interim storage.
This plan should recognize that remediation will require a systems engineering approach, involving integration
of facilities and capabilities at a number of sites, and will require attention to limiting worker exposure and minimizing
generation of additional waste and emission of effluents to the environment. The plan should include a provision
that, within a reasonable period of time (such as eight years), all storage of plutonium metal and oxide should be in
conformance with the draft DOE Standard on storage of plutonium now being made final.

(2) That a research program be established to fill any gaps in the information base needed for choosing among the alternate
processes to be used in safe conversion of various types of fissile materials to optimal forms for safe interim storage
and the longer term disposition. Development this research program should be addressed in the program plan called
for by (1) above.

(3) That preparations be expedited to process the dissolved plutonium and trans-plutonium isotopes in tanks in the
F-Canyon at the Savannah River Site into forms safer for interim storage. The Board considers this problem to be especially
urgent.

(4) That preparations be expedited to repackage the plutonium metal that is in contact with, or in proximity to, plastic
and to eliminate the associated existing hazard in any other way that is feasible and reliable. Storage of plutonium
materials generated through this remediation process should be such that containers need not be opened again for
additional treatment for a reasonably long time.

(5) That preparations be expedited to process the containers of possibly unstable residues at the Rocky Flats Plant
and to convert constituent plutonium to a form suitable for safe interim storage.

(6) That preparations be expedited to process the deteriorating irradiated reactor fuel stored in basins at the Savannah
River Site into a form suitable for safe interim storage until an option for ultimate disposition is selected.

(7) That the program be accelerated to place the deteriorating reactor fuel in the K-East Basin at the Hanford Site
in a stable configuration for interim storage until an option for ultimate disposition is chosen. This program needs
to be directed toward storage methods that will minimize further deterioration.

(8) That those facilities that may be needed for future handling and treatment of the materials in question be maintained

ACTION:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service, invites comments on proposed information collection
requests as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide
interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB
may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval
process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere
with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. .




The Acting Director, Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice with the attached proposed
information collection request prior to submission of this request to OMB. This notice contains the following information:
(1) Type of review requested, 

e.g.,

 expedited; (2) Title; (3) Abstract; (4) Additional Information; (5) Frequency of collection; (6) Affected public;
and (7) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden. Because an expedited review is requested, a description of the information
to be collected is also included as an attachment to this notice.

Type of Review: 

Emergency



Title: 

Report of Financial Need and Certification for the Jacob K. Javits Fellows Program



Abstract: 

The Report is designed to collect required information from institutions of higher education regarding graduate
participants of the Jacob K. Javits Fellows Program. The data collected is required in order that continued funding
may be requested for the fellows.

Budget. The Department's requested approval date is May 31, 1994. This collection requirement expires on May 31,
1994. If this happens, the Department would have no legal means of collecting the information from institutions in
which the successful applicants plan to enroll, and therefore would not be able to obligate the funds appropriated
for this purpose in FY 1994.

One time



Affected Public: 

Individuals or households; Non-profit institutions

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of an Amendment/Extension of an Experimental Use Permit for a Transgenic Plant Pesticide </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 5, 1994, EPA issued an amendment/extension for Experimental Use Permit (524-EUP-73) to Monsanto
Company to conduct field testing of a transgenic plant pesticide. The first EUP on this organism was issued April 10,
1992. The Agency has determined that this may be of national or regional significance. Therefore, in accordance with
40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting public comments on this application. 




Dates

: Written comments must be received on or before July 5, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Monsanto Company experimental use program proposes to assess the effectiveness of six different versions of
delta-endotoxin when expressed in several varieties of cotton and to introduce the delta-endotoxin genes into other
cotton cultivars. An extension of the experimental use permit was granted May 18, 1993. An additional amendment was
granted December 1993, for the purposes of adding two sites in Puerto Rico. The purpose of this amendment/extension
is to conduct an additional 12 experiments on 120 sites in 15 states (four additional states to include Florida, Maryland,
Missouri, and Virginia) and the territory of Puerto Rico. Total transgenic B.t.k. cotton plantings at all sites combined
will not exceed 1,665 acres. Cotton lines for the additional sites contain the plasmid vectors PV-GHBKO3, PV-GHBKO4,
and PV-GHBKO7. 


EPA's scientific staff has evaluated the potential for adverse effects on nontarget species and the environment
as a result of this EUP amendment. According to Monsanto, the B.t.k. delta-endotoxin is expected to occur in roots,
stems, leaves, bolls and seeds of the cotton plant; the NPT II marker enzyme is expected to occur in stems and seeds.
Neither protein was detected by Monsanto in the pollen, nectar or lint of the genetically-engineered cotton plants.
The Agency does not foresee any human health risks or effects resulting from the proposed field tests because there
will be minimal human exposure. 
Several microbial pesticides containing nonengineered B.t.k. proteins have been registered over the last few years
for which extensive avian, aquatic, and beneficial insect testing has failed to demonstrate any significant toxicity
to these nontarget organisms. Monsanto, however, is using a truncated form of delta-endotoxin in three of its seven
genetically-engineered cotton plants; it is possible that the truncated forms of B.t.k. proteins may affect a greater
range of organisms than the full-length, nonengineered B.t.k. proteins present in wettable powder or oil flowable
microbial pesticide formulations. This is not a concern, however, due to the limited exposure for nontarget organisms
with the EUP amendment. 
Because the field tests will be conducted in areas of the States where no known population of endangered lepidopteran
species exist, no risk is expected as a result of the additional sites. In addition, because of the low exposure due
the limited acreage and duration of the EUP, EPA feels that there will not be a situation warranting a formal review
under the Endangered Species Act for any endangered mammals, birds, invertebrates, plants, or aquatic species.
Comments on this EUP amendment should be submitted by July 5, 1994.

<USDEPT>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare Environmental Impact Statement for New Federal Courthouse in Savannah, GA</DOCTITLE>




Pursuant to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C.A. 4321 to 4370d),
and the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508), as implemented by General Services
Administration (GSA) Order PBS P 1095.4B, GSA announces its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for the siting and construction of a new Federal Courthouse within the Central Business Area (CBA) of Savannah,
Georgia.


The EIS will examine the short and long term impacts from constructing and operating a New Courthouse in the Savannah
CBA, on the natural and human environments. This includes but is not limited to impacts on historic and cultural resources,
traffic and parking, and socioeconomics (including the impacts on local businesses and neighborhoods). The EIS
will also examine measures to mitigate unavoidable adverse impacts of the proposed action. Concurrent with NEPA
implementation, GSA will also implement its consultation requirements under Section 106 (36 CFR 800) of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470), regarding the impacts on historic properties as a result of undertaking
the proposed action. GSA is very much aware of the potential for adverse affects on historic resources as a result of
proposed action, and will make every effort to identify and take into account such affects when siting this project.


The New Courthouse will house 331 employees in an approximately 250,000 gross square foot structure that will meet
the 10-year space requirements of the US Courts. The project will contain five courtrooms, and office space for Court-related
agencies, as well as space for GSA and the Postal Service. This information is presented only as a summary of the project's
space requirements: GSA has not designed the facility even in concept. Design of the facility will not begin until
after a site has been selected and procured. The site itself will not be procured until after the EIS and the NEPA process
is completed.


Although a specific site has not yet been determined, there are two important locational considerations for this
project. First, Executive Order 12072 (16 AUG 1978, 43 FR 36869) requires Federal agencies to give primary consideration
to the CBA when acquiring space in an urban area unless the Federal agency has operational needs requiring it to locate
outside the CBA. The purpose of this Executive Order is to encourage the location of Federal facilities where they
will serve to strengthen the nation's cities and to make them attractive places to live and work. In this case, the Court
has no need to locate outside of the CBA.


Second, the Court does have an operational need that would be best served if the New Courthouse is located adjacent
to the existing Federal Building-Courthouse at 125 Bull Street. This location would considerably reduce the security
risk, as well as the administrative and operational inefficiencies of ``splitting'' the Courts, by minimizing the
distance between two locations. An adjacent location is strongly preferred by the Courts and GSA; however, it is a
preference only, and does not preclude consideration of an alternative CBA site.


As part of NEPA and Section 106 implementation, GSA is actively seeking public input into the decision-making process,
including the identification of issues to be examined in the EIS, and the identification of ``reasonable'' alternatives
to the proposed action. Reasonable, in this case, means that the alternative must still satisfy GSA's basic project
goals. These goals are to satisfy the Courts' operational requirements, and house its 10-year space requirement,
in a cost-effective manner, in Government-owned space.


GSA has tentatively identified the following alternatives, some of which may not be technically feasible, to be examined
in the EIS:


 ``No Action,'' that is, undertake no new construction.


 Construction adjacent to the existing Federal Building-Courthouse at one of the following potential locations:






_On a parcel bounded by State, Bull, Broughton, and Whitaker Streets (preferred alternative).

_On a parcel bounded by York, Bull, Oglethorpe, and Whitaker Streets.

_On a parcel bounded by Broughton, Barnard, State, and Whitaker Streets.

_On a parcel bounded by State, Barnard, York, and Whitaker Streets.

_On a parcel bounded by Barnard, York, Whitaker, and Oglethorpe Streets.







 Identification and consideration of other feasible sites that will satisfy the stated goals of the project
in the CBA will be determined through the scoping process and by Solicitation for Offers by GSA.


As part of the public scoping process, you are encouraged to contact GSA in writing at the following address with your
concerns and comments regarding the proposed project: Mr. Philip Youngberg, Regional Environmental Officer_4PL,
401 West Peachtree Street, NW., Suite 2500, Atlanta, GA 30365-2550; or FAX your comments to Mr. Youngberg at
404-331-7169. Comments should be postmarked no later than July 5, 1994.


GSA also intends to conduct a Public Scoping Meeting to solicit verbal comments, and address general questions concerning
the project, NEPA, and Section 106. A Notice of this meeting and all subsequent public meetings conducted by GSA for
this project will appear in the Savannah News-Press at lest two weeks prior to the meeting date. Notices announcing
the availability and review periods for the Draft EIS and Final EIS will also be published in the Savannah News-Press.
Persons and organizations on the mailing list will be notified of all meetings and publications by mail. Persons who
would like to be added to the mailing list should write or call GSA at the address or phone number listed in this notice.

Requests for Nominations of Members of Clinical Practice; Guideline Panel on Acute Myocardial Infarction 


The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) has announced a request for proposals and intends to award a
contract to a non-profit organization to develop a clinical practice guideline and to develop related medical review
criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures for Acute Myocardial Infarction. The contractor will
establish a panel of health care experts and consumers to assist in developing a clinical practice guideline on Acute
Myocardial Infarction and to assist in developing medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance
measures. The AHCPR, on behalf of the contractor, invites nominations of qualified individuals to serve as chairperson(s)
and members of the panel. 


Background 


The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-239) added a new title IX to the Public Health Service
Act (the Act), which established the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) to enhance the quality, appropriateness,
and effectiveness of health care services, and access to such services. (See 42 U.S.C. 299-299c-6 and 1320b-12.)
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Reauthorization Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-410), enacted on October
13, 1992, extended the authorization of AHCPR and amended certain provisions related to the development of clinical
practice guidelines. In keeping with its legislative mandates, AHCPR is arranging for the development, periodic
review, and updating of clinically relevant guidelines that may be used by physicians, other health care practitioners,
educators, and consumers to assist in determining how diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can most
effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, and clinically managed. Medical review criteria,
standards of quality, and performance measures are then developed based on the guidelines produced. 
Section 912 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-1(b)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, requires that the guidelines:

1. Be based on the best available research and professional judgment; 
2. Be presented in formats appropriate for use by physicians, other health care practitioners, medical educators,
medical review organizations, and consumers; 
3. Be presented in treatment-specific or condition-specific forms appropriate for use in clinical practice, educational
programs, and reviewing quality and appropriateness of medical care; 
4. Include information on the risks and benefits of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
and management of the particular health condition(s); and 
5. Include information on the costs of alternative strategies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management
of the particular health condition(s), where cost information is available and reliable. 
Section 913 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-2) describes two mechanisms through which AHCPR can arrange for development
of guidelines: 1. Panels of qualified experts and health care consumers may be convened; and 2. Contracts may be awarded
to public and private non-profit organizations. The AHCPR has elected to use the contract process for development
of a clinical practice guideline on Acute Myocardial Infarction. 
Section 914 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 299b-3(a)), as amended by Public Law 102-410, identifies factors to be considered
in establishing priorities for guidelines, including the extent to which the guidelines would:

<TEXT>
 

1. Improve methods for disease prevention; 
2. Improve methods of diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management, and thereby benefit a significant number of
individuals; 
3. Reduce clinically significant variations among clinicians in the particular services and procedures utilized
in making diagnoses and providing treatments; and 
4. Reduce clinically significant variations in the outcomes of health care services and procedures. 
Also, in accordance with title IX of the PHS Act and section 1142 of the Social Security Act, the AHCPR Administrator
is to assure that the needs and priorities of the Medicare program are reflected appropriately in the agenda and priorities
for development of guidelines. 


Panel Nominations 


The panel that will assist the contractor in developing the clinical practice guideline on Acute Myocardial Infarction
will consist of two co-chairpersons and ten to fifteen other members. The work will be divided into two phases. Phase
I is development of the clinical practice guideline. Phase II is development of medical review criteria, standards
of quality, and performance measures based on the guideline. 
The role of the panel members is to assist the contractor to: develop a decisionmaking process; determine the focus
of the guideline and the questions to be addressed; advise and monitor the review and analysis of the scientific literature;
consider and advise on principal health care issues; monitor and provide counsel on development of medical review
criteria, standards of quality, and performance measures; and review and approve the interim and final drafts of
the different versions of the guideline. The co-chairpersons will provide leadership in carrying out these roles.

To assist in identifying members for the panel, AHCPR is requesting recommendations from a broad range of interested
individuals and organizations, including physicians representing primary care and relevant specialties, physicians'
assistants, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, allied health and other health care practitioners, health
care institutions, and consumers with pertinent experience or information. In making panel selections, AHCPR,
will maintain, to the extent possible, a balance of individuals selected from academic settings and individuals
selected without full-time academic appointments. At least two members of this panel shall be individuals who do
not derive their primary source of revenue directly from the performance of procedures discussed in this guideline.
Some participants in the guideline process (panel members, consultants, peer or pilot reviewers) should have expertise
in epidemiology, health services research, or health economics, and familiarity with the clinical condition being
studied. To the extent possible, the panel should have appropriate representation in terms of gender, minority populations,
and geographic areas of the United States. 
The AHCPR is especially interested in receiving nominations of individuals with: (1) Experience in developing and/or
commitment to developing clinical guidelines, medical review criteria, standards of quality, and performance
measures; (2) relevant training and clinical experience; (3) relevant experience in basic and/or clinical research
in acute myocardial infarction, including publication of relevant peer-reviewed articles; (4) demonstrated interest
in quality of care, medical outcomes, and medical effectiveness; (5) knowledge of the epidemiology of acute myocardial
infarction; (6) experience in health services research or health economics, with expertise in the area of acute myocardial
infarction; and (7) personal experience of acute myocardial infarction, either as a patient, family member, or friend
of a patient, or as a person who actively works with consumer groups interested in acute myocardial infarction. The
AHCPR encourages nominations of women and individuals who are members of minority population groups. Nominees should
have no substantial financial interests or professional affiliations that would significantly jeopardize the
integrity of the guideline development process or the final products. 
This notice requests nominations of qualified individuals to serve on the panel as members or as co-chairpersons.
The functions of the panel co-chairpersons are critical to the process of developing guidelines. Co-chairpersons
provide leadership regarding methodology, literature review, panel deliberations, and preparation of the final
products. Nominations for co-chairpersons should take into consideration the criteria specified below, which
AHCPR will use in approving final selections:

Health Studies Related to the National Exposure Registry

Introduction


The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
funds for a cooperative agreement/grant program to conduct health studies of trichloroethylene (TCE)-exposed
subpopulations that comprise the TCE Subregistry of the National Exposure Registry. The studies will address health
conditions identified by ATSDR as potential health conditions associated with environmental exposure to TCE, with
emphasis on neurotoxic disorders. The recipient will utilize the National Exposure Registry Trichloroethylene
(TCE) Subregistry database in designing and executing these studies.
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy
People 2000,'' see the section Where to Obtain Additional Information.)





Authority:

 This program is authorized under sections 104(i)(1)(E),(7), and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) of 1986, (42 U.S.C. 9604 (i)(1)(E),(7), and (15)).


Smoke-Free Workplace


The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American People.


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents. This includes the
District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and
federally-recognized Indian tribal governments. State organizations, including State universities, State colleges,
and State research institutions, must establish that they meet their respective State's legislature definition
of a State entity or political subdivision to be considered an eligible applicant.


Availability of Funds


Approximately $1,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund 3-5 new and competing awards. It is expected that the
average award will be $200,000, ranging from $100,000 to $300,000. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about
September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years.
Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds.


Purpose


The purpose of this announcement is to solicit scientific proposals designed to study the occurrence of/and risk
factors for specified health outcomes for persons who have had documented environmental exposure to TCE through
drinking or using contaminated water. The study population will include all, or a subset, of the TCE Subregistry registrants.
These studies will increase the knowledge base, and hence improve the ability of public health programs to address
potential public health problems related to exposure to hazardous substances.
Several research topics were suggested based on the analysis of the TCE Subregistry baseline data. The topics are
to be considered suggestions and not limitations. These topics are:



_Hearing, speech impairment in subpopulation exposed at >10 years of age (neurological disorders)
_Cardiac problems (possibly congenital) in subpopulation exposed at >10 years of age
_Diabetes
_Hypertension/stroke/heart problems in adult subpopulation


Program Requirements


The TCE baseline data and documentation are available on CD-ROM (4.75 inch disc) which is accessed using the Statistical
Export and Tabulation System (SETS), data format ISO 9660. This can be run on a fully IBM-compatible microcomputer
286/386/486 with 640K of memory, three megabytes of free space on a hard drive, an operating system of MS-DOS 3.1 or
higher and a fully installed CD-Rom reader.
Applicants must propose studies which will address one or more of the following areas of investigation:
A. Evaluate the occurrence of adverse health effects in the identified population. This will include the evaluation
of the incidence or prevalence of a disease, disease symptoms, self-reported health concerns, or biological markers
of disease, susceptibility, or exposure (see Purpose section for the specific disease outcomes specified).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00038 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

B. Identify risk factors for adverse health effects in the identified populations. This will include hypothesis
generating cohort or case-control studies on potentially impacted populations to identify linkages between exposure
and adverse health effects and those risk factors which may be impacted by prevention actions. (See Purpose section
for a listing of the adverse health effects of concern.) 

C. Develop methods to diagnose adverse health effects (see Purpose section for the adverse health effects of concern)
in populations. This will include medical research to evaluate currently available biological tests (biomarkers)
and disease occurrence in potentially impacted populations. 

ATSDR will provide financial assistance to applicants in designing and executing analytic epidemiologic studies
to explore the relationship between exposure to hazardous substances and the occurrence of, and risk factors for,
environmental exposure to TCE through drinking and using contaminated water, using all or a subset of the TCE Subregistry
registrants. 

Applicants must specify the type of award for which they are applying, either grant or cooperative agreement. These
two types of Federal assistance are explained below. 




A. Grants 



In a grant, the applicant will be required to conduct the proposed study without substantial programmatic involvement
by ATSDR. Grantees must meet the following requirements: The application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates
the applicant's ability to address the environmental health problems. 

The applicant's protocol should contain consent forms and questionnaires, baseline morbidity and mortality information,
procedures for collecting biologic and environmental specimens and for conducting laboratory analysis and evaluation
of the test results of biologic specimens, statistical and epidemiologic analysis of the study information, and
a description of the safeguards for protecting the confidentiality of individuals on whom data are collected. 

By comparison, the activities of the recipient and the ATSDR for a cooperative agreement are described in paragraph
B. 



B. Cooperative Agreements 



In a cooperative agreement, ATSDR will assist the collaborator in conducting the study. The application should be
presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the health problem in a collaborative
manner with the funding agency. In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall

Surveillance of Hazardous Substances Emergency Events 





Introduction 



The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
funds for a cooperative agreement program to conduct surveillance of hazardous substances emergency events. The
Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of
``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of
life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Surveillance and Data Systems and Environmental Health.
(To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section Where To Obtain Additional Information.) 


Authority 



This program is authorized in sections 104(i)(1)(E) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA) as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) (42 U.S.C. 9604
(i)(1)(E) and (15)). 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are the official public health departments of the States or their bona fide agents. This includes
the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States
of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and
federally recognized Indian tribal governments. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 15 awards. It is expected that the average
new award will be $70,000 ranging from $60,000 to $80,000 per 
award. It is expected that the awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, with a 12-month budget period within
a project period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within
the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 

Grantees currently funded under ATSDR's Program Announcement 207 
can apply and, if successful, the current award would roll over into this one (competitive renewal) for a project period
of 5 
years. If a current grantee applies under this competitive renewal announcement and is unsuccessful, it would not
jeopardize 
the current award; ATSDR will honor the current awards through the expiration of the project period, subject to satisfactory

progress and the availability of funds. If a current grantee should choose not to apply for this competitive renewal,
ATSDR will honor the current award through the expiration of the project period, subject to satisfactory progress
and the 
availability of funds. 



Use of Funds 



Funds may be expended for reasonable program purposes, such as 
personnel, travel, supplies, and services. Equipment may be purchased with cooperative agreement funds; however,
justification must be provided which should include a cost comparison of purchase versus lease options. All purchased
equipment must be compatible with ATSDR equipment and shall be returned to ATSDR at the completion of the project.




Purpose 



The primary purpose of this cooperative agreement program is to assist State health departments in developing a state-based

surveillance system for monitoring hazardous substances emergency events to allow the State health department
to better understand the public health impact of hazardous substances emergencies. 

The objectives of the surveillance system are to: 

1. Describe the distribution of hazardous substances emergencies within individual States; 

2. Describe the type and cause of morbidity and mortality experienced by employees, first responders, and the general
public as a result of selected hazardous substances emergencies; 

3. Analyze and describe risk factors associated with the morbidity and mortality; and 

4. Develop and propose strategies to reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality when comparable events occur in the
future. 



Program Requirements 



All Hazardous Substances Emergency Event Surveillance (HSEES) will be performed in accordance with the methodology
provided in the HSEES protocol. The protocol was developed to meet the objectives outlined under Purpose. A copy of
the protocol will be provided in the application kit. For purposes of this 
program, the following criteria define an emergency event:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. An uncontrolled or illegal release or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances (

Note:

 The substances that are actually released or threatened to be released include all hazardous substances 

except

 petroleum products), and 

2. The quantity of the hazardous substances which are released, or are threatened to be released, need (or would need)
to be removed, cleaned up, or neutralized according to Federal, State, or local law; or 

3. There is only a threatened release of hazardous substances, but this threat leads to an action (e.g., an evacuation)
that can potentially impact the health of employees, responders, or the general public. This action makes the event
eligible for inclusion into the surveillance system, even though the hazardous substances are not released. 

A hazardous substance includes, but is not limited to, any element, substance, compound, or mixture, including disease-causing
agents, which after release into the environment and upon exposure, ingestion, inhalation, or assimilation into
any organism, either directly from the environment or indirectly by ingestion through the food chain, will or may
reasonably be anticipated to cause death, disease, behavioral abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutation, physiological
malfunctions (including malfunctions in reproduction) or physical deformations, in such organisms or their offspring;
except that the term ``hazardous substance'' does not include petroleum products, including crude oil or any fraction
thereof which is not otherwise specifically listed or designated as a ``hazardous substance.'' 

To achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for conducting activities under A., below,
and ATSDR will be responsible for conducting activities under B., below: 



A. Recipient Activities 



1. Develop a mechanism that ensures that the State health department is notified of hazardous substances emergency
events in a timely fashion. This should include negotiating formal or informal agreements with all State agencies
that are normally notified when hazardous substances emergencies have occurred. These State agencies should include,
but not be limited to, State police, fire departments, environmental agencies, and various offices of emergency
government. 

2. Investigate the emergency event by gathering and entering the information obtained from all sources into the HSEES
tracking system. Sources may include, but not be limited to, those agencies mentioned in A.1., and other relevant
Federal, State, local, and private agencies in keeping with the surveillance protocol. 

3. Establish and maintain appropriate procedures to ensure the timely gathering and entering the information into
a database as prescribed by the HSEES protocol. 



B. ATSDR Activities 



1. Assist recipients in acquiring appropriate information for performance of HSEES and evaluating the completeness
and quality of relevant information. 

2. Provide prototype information gathering instrument. 

3. Assist recipients in establishing and maintaining appropriate and timely schedules for the HSEES surveillance
process. 

4. Assist recipients in selecting training that will be useful in maintaining the surveillance system. 

5. Analyze environmental and/or biological results for specific situations in which ATSDR has concerns. 

6. Evaluate the overall performance of recipient's adherence to the surveillance protocol. 



Evaluation Criteria 



Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria: 



A. Review Criteria for States New to HSEES

Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to 
National Association of People With AIDS (NAPWA) 


Summary 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a sole source cooperative agreement program with the National Association of People With AIDS (NAPWA) to continue
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and education programs and technical assistance being provided
to HIV infected and affected persons and the organizations that serve them. Approximately $350,000 is available
in FY 1994 to support this project. It is expected that the award will be made on or about September 25, 1994, for a 12-month
budget period within a 5-year project period. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis
of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist, collaboratively with NAPWA, in strengthening effective
HIV/AIDS prevention education programs at all levels throughout the United States and its territories; to prevent
HIV transmission and effect, maintain, measure, and evaluate behavioral change among individuals whose behavior
places them at risk of HIV infection; to increase access to prevention and early intervention services for HIV-infected
persons in order to reduce risks of further transmission and to maintain the health of asymptomatic clients; and to
increase collaboration and support among agencies, organizations, groups, and constituencies providing HIV prevention
services.

CDC will collaborate in providing consultation and technical assistance in planning, operating, and evaluating
program activities. Specifically, CDC will work with NAPWA to: (1) Facilitate collaboration with State and local
health departments and other national and community organizations to reach persons most at risk for HIV infection;
(2) assist in the identification of HIV prevention education programs, policies, practices, and procedures that
have been demonstrated to be effective; (3) facilitate efforts in the provision of technical assistance and training
to organizations that are involved in HIV prevention community planning; (4) assist with the development of plans
to evaluate all program activities and to interpret evaluation findings.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome (AIDS). (To order a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the Section entitled ``Where to Obtain Additional

<DOCTITLE>Announcement of a Cooperative Agreement to the World Health Organization </DOCTITLE>



Summary 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the availability of funds for fiscal year (FY) 1994
for a sole source cooperative agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) to conduct polio surveillance,
provide technical assistance in developing a laboratory network, provide programmatic assistance to carry out
operational and applied research, and to provide oral polio vaccine for supplemental immunization activities for
the global initiative to eradicate polio by the year 2000. Approximately $1.2 to $1.6 million will be available in
FY 1994 to support this project. It is expected the award will begin on July 1, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within
a 3-year project period. The funding estimate is subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period
will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to support the polio eradication initiative by providing technical,
laboratory, programmatic consultants, operational and applied research, oral polio vaccine, and other services,
as needed, to the governments of polio endemic countries. Specific activities should be in the areas of polio surveillance
to define and assess the polio endemic countries, including surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis, development
of a laboratory network for poliovirus isolation in developing countries, and assistance to foreign governments
in planning and implementing national immunization days and other polio eradication activities.

CDC will collaborate by providing (1) technical assistance to WHO in support of activities implemented under this
agreement; (2) programmatic support to national governments for planning, implementing, and evaluating polio
eradication activities; (3) technical training, support, and consultation to expert staff hired by WHO to assist
in the polio eradication initiative; (4) expertise for the surveillance to assess, define, and prioritize the assistance
needs of polio endemic countries and assist in the development of a laboratory network for poliovirus isolation in
developing countries; and (5) other technical assistance in support of this project, as needed.

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

research in the area addressed and which is suitable for publication in refereed health professions journals, including
research-oriented publications. 

4. The project must include an explicit strategy for case-finding and a strategy for making direct comparisons to
other forms of treatment. The results must be generalizable to patients cared for in clinical practices addressing
spinal and/or lower-back conditions. 

5. Whenever feasible, minorities and women should be included in study populations so that research findings can
be of benefit to all persons at risk of the disease, disorder, or condition under study.

<DOCTITLE>Consensus Development Conference on Optimal Calcium Intake </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given of the NIH Consensus Development Conference on ``Optimal Calcium Intake,'' which will be held
June 6-8, 1994, in the Masur Auditorium of the National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda,
Maryland 20892. This conference is sponsored by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases and the NIH Office of Medical Applications of Research. The conference begins at 8:30 a.m. on June 6 and 7 and
at 9 a.m. on June 8. 

Over the past decade, both the general public and scientists have been exposed to a great deal of literature about the
value of ensuring an adequate calcium intake throughout life. A number of articles in the medical literature have
addressed the role of calcium intake in the prevention of disorders including osteoporosis and other bone diseases,
colon cancer, and high blood pressure (hypertension) including preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.
Results of one recent study indicated that high calcium intake can decrease the risk of kidney stones_a somewhat surprising
conclusion since high dietary calcium intake had been strongly suspected to increase the risk of kidney stones. 

Osteoporosis affects more than 25 million people in the United States and is the major underlying cause of bone fractures
in postmenopausal women and the elderly. Two important factors that influence whether osteoporosis occurs are the
peak bone density (or bone mass) attained in early life (by about age 30) and the rate at which bones is lost in later life.
Calcium intake is thought to help build denser, stronger bones in early life and to slow the rate of bone loss with age.


Results from several studies reported in the recent medical literature suggest that increased calcium intake is
beneficial for bone health in people in different age groups, from children to the very elderly. The results of this
research and studies on other diseases indicate that the optimal level of calcium intake may be greater than the amount
consumed by a majority of the American people. This conference will discuss and thoroughly evaluate the information
available on calcium intake and disease prevention. 

Optimal calcium intake may vary according to the disease being considered, and may also vary according to a person's
age, sex, and ethnicity. Optimal calcium intake may be achieved by diet, calcium supplements, or calcium-fortified
foods, or by various combinations of these. In addition, various cofactors play a role in achieving optimal calcium
intake. These include both factors such as vitamin D, which is needed for optimal calcium absorption, and factors
that can negatively influence calcium availability, such as certain medications or foods. The purpose of this NIH
consensus conference is to evaluate the available data on optimal calcium intake and health status. Conference participants
will include specialists in many different fields, including osteoporosis and bone health, oncology, hypertension,
human nutrition, and food fortification and labeling, as well as representatives from the public. 

After 11/2 days of presentations and audience discussion, an independent, non-Federal consensus panel will weigh
the scientific evidence and write a draft statement in response to the following key questions: 

 What is the optimal amount of calcium intake? 

 What are the important cofactors for achieving optimal calcium intake? 

 What are the risk factors associated with different levels of calcium intake? 

 What are the best ways to attain optimal calcium intake? 

 What public health strategies are available and needed to implement optimal calcium intake? 

 What are the recommendations for future research on calcium? 

On the final day of the meeting, the consensus panel chairman will read the draft statement to the conference audience
and invite comments and questions. 

Advance information on the conference program and conference registration materials may be obtained from: Ann Besignano,
Technical Resources, Inc., 3202 Tower Oaks Blvd., suite 200, Rockville, Maryland 20852, (301) 770-3153. 

The consensus statement will be submitted for publication in professional journals and other publications. In addition,
the consensus statement will be available beginning June 8, 1994, from the NIH Consensus Program Information Service,
P.O. Box 2577, Kensington, Maryland 20891, phone 1-800-NIH-OMAR (1-800-644-6627).

<DOCTITLE>Meeting of Panel/Request for Public Comment </DOCTITLE>



The fifth, and probably final, meeting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research Panel will
be held June 21-22 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day at the Holiday Inn Bethesda, 8120 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland. The Panel is a group of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established
to recommend guidelines for Federal funding of research involving the 

ex utero

 human embryo resulting from 

in vitro

 fertilization or other sources. At the June meeting, the Panel will work toward the resolution of outstanding issues
and review a draft report of its findings and conclusions. 


Background


Research involving the 

ex utero 

human embryo has many potential scientific and therapeutic benefits. Among the most direct and immediate possible
gains are the treatment of infertility and the advancement of preimplantation diagnosis of genetic and chromosomal
abnormalities. Other research focusing on the processes of fertilization and implantation could clarify the causes
of infertility. Studies of normal and abnormal early embryonic development could enhance understanding of the causes
of pregnancy loss, birth defects, and the mechanisms of uncontrolled cell growth that occur in cancer. Other research
efforts could be applied to the development of novel contraceptives. In the longer term, research on embryonic stem
cells could have therapeutic applications in a broad range of areas, including bone marrow transplantation, repair
of damaged tissues, and treatment of degenerative diseases of the nervous and muscular systems. 
The NIH has received a number of applications for support of research involving the 

ex utero

 human embryo as well as research involving parthenogenesis (the initiation of development of an ovum without sperm).
Before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the NIH must address
the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines to govern
the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. The Human Embryo Research Panel was established to assist the
NIH in this effort. The Panel's charge is to consider various areas of research involving the 

ex utero

 human embryo and provide advice as to those areas it views to be acceptable for Federal funding, areas that warrant
additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research considered acceptable
for Federal funding, the Panel will recommend specific guidelines for the review and conduct of this research. Issues
related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's purview. The Panel's final report will be
presented to the ACD for review. 
During part of its first and second meeting, the Panel reviewed the wide range of scientific and human health benefits
that could result from governmental support of research involving the 

ex utero

 human embryo. At the third meeting, Panel deliberations focused on issues related to the moral status of the human
embryo and acceptability of areas of 

ex utero 

human embryo research; ethically acceptable sources of human embryos and oocytes, including informed consent requirements,
issues raised by compensation of sperm/egg providers, and concerns regarding commercialization; and, appropriate
mechanisms/levels of review of research proposals involving the 

ex utero 

human embryo. The fourth meeting of the Panel was devoted to the consideration of a preliminary draft of proposed guidelines.



Public Comment Process


The NIH continues to seek public comment on these and other issues raised by Federal funding of human embryo research
and encourages interested individuals and organizations to share with the Panel their views and perspectives on
these important matters. Those who wish to submit written comments of any length should forward these to Steven Muller,
Ph.D., Chair, NIH Human Embryo Research Panel,
 c/o National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 

#

1, room 218, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. 
Each meeting of the Panel has also provided an opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to make brief
oral presentations to the Panel. To register to make an oral statement before the Panel, individuals and organizations
should contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor at the NIH by telephoning 301-496-1454 or by sending a facsimile message
to 301-402-0280 or 301-402-1759. Oral statements must not exceed five minutes in length,
and a copy of the remarks should be forwarded to the above address one week in advance of the scheduled presentation
date. Opportunities to present statements are limited and will be determined by the order in which requests are received.


The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. To ensure that
adequate seating is available for the public, individuals interested in attending the meeting are asked to notify
the NIH by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed above. Individuals who require special accommodations
are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number. General questions about the Panel or future meetings should
also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

<USBUREAU>Public Health Service</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Inclusion of Outpatient Hospital Facilities</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 602 of Public Law 102-585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the
manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under
a statutory formula.



Section 340B(a)(4) lists the entities eligible to receive discount outpatient drug pricing (

i.e., 

certain disproportionate share hospitals (DSHs) and PHS grantees). The definition of a disproportionate share
hospital found in section 340B(a)(4)(L) provides criteria to determine which such hospitals are eligible to participate
in the program. However, the definition does not include criteria to determine which outpatient facilities (including
off-site or satellite clinics) working in conjunction with the eligible hospital would be considered part of the
hospital for purposes of eligibility for section 340B drug discounts. The Office of Drug Pricing, which administers
this program with PHS, is proposing certain procedures to determine which outpatient hospital facilities are included
as part of an eligible disproportionate share hospital.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive the section 340B discount
pricing. Section 340B(a)(4)(L) 

1

 describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act as eligible to
participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient services only,
the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section 340B deals
exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intended that this narrow definition be used to identify
Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we do not believe
it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drug can be used. Some disproportionate
share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities. Further, the movement
of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services other than traditional
inpatient hospital services through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities. Therefore, for purposes
of section 340B drug discounts, a more inclusive interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed. 





The Office of Drug Pricing Program is proposing to recognize as part of an eligible DSH outpatient facilities (including
off-site and satellite clinics) which meet the following standard:

The outpatient facility is considered an integral part of the ``hospital'' and therefore eligible for section 340B
drug discounts if it is a reimbursable facility included on the hospital's Medicare cost report.

For example, if a hospital with one Medicare provider number meets the disproportionate share criteria and this hospital
has associated outpatient clinics whose costs are listed on the Medicare cost report, these clinics would also be
eligible for section 340B drug discounts. However, free-standing clinics of the hospital that submit their own cost
reports using a different Medicare number (not under the single hospital Medicare provider number) would not be eligible
for this benefit.

This test, using the single Medicare provider number, is proposed for three reasons. First, Congress referred to
section 1886 of the Social Security Act, part of the Medicare statute, for the definition of a DSH in section 340B(a)(4)(L)
of the PHS Act. We believe, therefore, that it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility
for the drug discount program. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and is used,
in part, to determine whether a facility is part of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital
cost report, it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility.

Second, the relative administrative burden of the proposed test (

i.e., 

obtaining sufficient documentation to verify the inclusion of these off-site facilities) should be minimal. Hospitals
seeking Medicare reimbursement are required to submit annual cost reports including all hospital units (

e.g., 

on site and off-site clinics); therefore, the information necessary to determine facility eligibility is available
and needs no further analysis by the Office of Drug Pricing.

Third, the test incorporates criteria (

i.e., 

the Medicare cost report) that form an independent and objective basis upon which to determine eligibility. Therefore,
this test should provide fair and easy administration.

If DSHs have difficulty accessing PHS pricing for eligible outpatient clinics, they should contact the Office of
Drug Pricing (not HCFA) for assistance. If manufacturers have questions concerning the eligibility of certain DSH
outpatient clinics, they should also contact the Office of Drug Pricing for a determination of eligibility.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally 
suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated lists until such time as it is restored to full certification
under the Guidelines. 


If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 


Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum 
standards.

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities To Assist the Homeless



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with Sections 2905 and 2906 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, P.L. 103-160
(Pryor Act Amendment) and with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance
Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property
that HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information
provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property
controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess of surplus Federal property. This Notice is
also published in order to comply with the April 21, 1993 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration,

 No. 88-2508-OG (D.D.C.).





These properties reviewed are listed as suitable/available and unsuitable. In accordance with the Pryor Act Amendment
the suitable properties will be made available for use to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Please be advised, in accordance with the provisions of the Pryor Act Amendment, that if no
expressions of interest or applications are received by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) during
the 60 day period, these properties will no longer be available for use to assist the homeless. In the case of buildings
and properties for which no such notice is received, these buildings and properties shall be available only for the
purpose of permitting a redevelopment authority to express in writing an interest in the use of such buildings and
properties. These buildings and properties shall be available for a submission by such redevelopment authority
exclusively for one year. Buildings and properties available for a redevelopment authority shall not be available
for use to assist the homeless. If a redevelopment authority does not express an interest in the use of the buildings
or properties or commence the use of buildings or properties within the applicable time period such buildings and
properties shall then be republished as properties available for use to assist the homeless pursuant to Section 501
of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.

Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS,
addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service, HHS, room 17A-10,
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the
interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In
order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions
of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged
to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register,

 the landholding agency, and the property number. 

For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (i.e., acreage, floor plan, existing
sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate landholding agencies at
the following addresses: Corps of Engineers: Gary B. Paterson, Chief, Base Realignment and Closure Office, Directorate
of Real Estate, 20 Massachusetts Ave., NW., Rm. 4133, Washington, DC 20314-1000; (202) 272-0520; U.S.
Navy: John J. Kane, Deputy Division Director, Dept. of Navy, Real Estate Operations, Naval Facilities Engineering
Command, 200 Stovall Street, Alexandria, VA 22332-2300; (703) 325-0474; U.S. Air Force: John Carr, Realty
Specialist, HQ-AFBDA/BDR, Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-5130; (703) 696-5569; (These are not
toll-free numbers).

Correction: On April 1, 1994, at 59 FR 15420, property Numbers 219330315-219330317, Army Wherry Family Housing,
Stewart Gardens, New York, inadvertently published for off-site use only. The properties are for on-site use and
are scheduled to be vacated in the Spring of 1996. The properties include 23 residential apartment buildings, 5 detached
garages, and 30 storage sheds.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Withdrawal and Opportunity for Public Meeting; </DOCTITLE>
Arizona 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Land Management, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management proposes to withdraw 
2,335.21 acres of public land to protect the unique habitat of the federally-listed endangered Nichol's Turk's Head
Cactus. 
This notice closes the land for up to 2 years from settlement, sale, entry or location under the general land laws and
the mining laws. The land will remain open to mineral leasing and discretionary uses as approved by the authorized
officer. The withdrawal will be made subject to valid existing rights. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 4, 1994, a petition was approved allowing BLM to file the subject withdrawal proposal. This action will withdraw
land within the Waterman Mountains Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC). The withdrawal will protect 1
of only 2 known locations in the United States of the Nichol's Turk's Head Cactus. It will protect the species from surface
disturbing activities and potential destruction. This proposal is in compliance with existing plans for protection
of the species. 


In 1979, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the cactus as endangered and completed the Recovery Plan for the
species in 1986. The BLM has since completed the Phoenix Resource Management Plan in which the recommendation is to
pursue withdrawal of the ACEC resulting in protection of this critical habitat. Lands proposed for withdrawal are
located in Pima County and are legally described as follows: 


Gila and Salt River Meridian 


T. 12 S., R. 9 E.,

Federal Register

 at least 30 days before the scheduled date of the meeting. 
The application will be processed in accordance with the regulations set forth in 43 CFR part 2300. 
For a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, the lands will be segregated as specified above unless the application is denied or cancelled or the withdrawal is

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Animal Damage Control (ADC) and
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PA) have applied for permits to take migratory birds, including several
species of gulls at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA). The Lead Agency for this Final Environmental Impact
Statement (FEIS) is the ADC. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is a cooperating agency with jurisdiction
by law and actively participated in the scoping, drafting and reviewing of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement
(DEIS) and the FEIS. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations ( 1506.3, title 40 CFR) for
Implementing Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and the Department of Interior, Departmental
Manual at 516 DM 1.1-6.6, the Service adopts the above FEIS as prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The Service used the information and analyses in the DEIS and FEIS to make its own, independent Record of Decision (ROD)
for this project. Based on its independent evaluation and review, the Service has selected an alternative similar
to the Integrated Management Program, Department of the Interior Policy (IMP/DOI) as its preferred alternative
(FEIS, pp. 6-7 to 6-9). The conditions contained in the IMP/DOI are designed to minimize environmental
harms and constitute an enforceable monitoring and enforcement program.


Background


JFKIA is one of three major airports in the New York Metropolitan Region, servicing approximately 28 million passengers
per year. It is located at the eastern end of Jamaica Bay, immediately adjacent to the Jamaica Bay National Wildlife
Refuge, which is part of Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA) [administered by the National Park Service (NPS)].
The interaction of birds and aircraft at JFKIA is a serious problem, creating significant hazards to human safety,
as well as causing financial losses due to aircraft destruction, equipment damage, runway closures, and associated
personnel costs. The proximity of the airport and wildlife refuge in a coastal location has contributed to an unusually
high incidence of bird strikes at JFKIA. As early as 1975, a Service study concluded that gulls (herring, ring-billed
and great black-backed) constituted the principal bird hazard at JFKIA. This problem was severely exacerbated by
the establishment and rapid growth of a breeding colony of laughing gulls on the salt marsh islands in Jamaica Bay located
at the southeast end of Runway 22R/4L. As the colony grew from 15 pairs in 1979 to more than 7,000 pairs in 1990, the number
of laughing gulls involved in bird strikes increased from 2 to as many as 187 per year, and the percentage of bird strikes
involving laughing gulls increased from less than 2 percent to approximately 50 percent. Other gulls accounted for
approximately 25 percent of JFKIA's bird strikes. The 58 other bird species together (1979-93) have accounted
for approximately 23 percent of the air strikes and 25 percent of the damage delays.
Throughout the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, the PA and Federal, New York State and New York City natural resource management
agencies have conducted activities to evaluate, control, and monitor JFKIA's bird strike hazard. These activities
have included, but are not limited to the following: Experimental laughing gull egg-oiling project; international
panel review; ecological studies; non-lethal harassment programs; and interim shooting programs. Despite implementation
by the PA of a multi-faceted bird hazard reduction program and closure of nearby landfills, strikes by laughing gulls
continued to increase. In response to the increase, a temporary, on-airport gull hazard reduction program was conducted
by the ADC unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1991 through 1993. Between May and August of each year, gulls
entering JFKIA airspace were shot. ADC biologists killed 14,191 laughing gulls in 1991, 11,847 in 1992, and about
6,500 in 1993. By the third year, this program reduced the number of bird strikes involving laughing gulls by more than
90 percent in the late 1980's.
In 1992, the concern for potential cumulative impacts associated with the shooting program demonstrated the need
to explore issues involved in reduction of the hazards of gull/aircraft interaction at JFKIA. Consequently, the
preparation of this Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was initiated to explore all reasonable alternatives
that might be implemented to reduce the number of gull/aircraft collisions at JFKIA in an effective, safe, environmentally
sound manner that is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
The EIS process, including early public participation, began in late 1992. The Notice of Intent to prepare the DEIS
was published in the December 4, 1992 

Federal Register

. At that time, the Service became a cooperating agency. One scoping meeting and one public meeting were held at JFKIA.
The Notice of Availability of the DEIS was published in the February 11, 1994 

Federal Register

. Prior to the release of the DEIS for public review, the Service reviewed several preliminary drafts. The comment
period of the DEIS ended April 25, 1994, however, comments were accepted through April 28, 1994. The Service reviewed
and commented on a preliminary FEIS, and all substantive comments were incorporated into the FEIS released to public.
The Notice of Availability of the FEIS appeared in the May 6, 1994 

Federal Register

. The Environmental Protection Agency granted a 16-day waiver in the 30-day comment period for the FEIS on April 29,
1994.


The Preferred Alternative


The Service's Preferred Alternative closely resembles the IMP/DOI policy, which is set forth in pages 6.6 through
6.9 of the FEIS. The Preferred Alternative contains more specific actions and time frames than are found in the FEIS
discussion of the IMP, which appears on page 6-11. These more specific time frames are discussed below in the
subsection entitled ``Service Actions'' within the ``Findings and Decisions'' portion of the ROD.

ADC's Proposed IMP in the FEIS identifies 6 elements. The Service has direct regulatory control or influence on 4 of
these 6 elements. These specific elements are (1) continued development of JFKIA's on-airport program, (2) on-airport
shooting of gulls, (3) laughing gull nest/egg destruction in Jamaica Bay, and (4) on-colony shooting of adult laughing
gulls. The Service has no regulatory control or influence on (1) reduction of off-airport attractants and (2) display
of gull models to harass gulls.
The IMP/DOI has been split into 2 separate categories. Category 1 elements address management actions off the GNRA
and Category 2 elements address management actions on the GNRA.
Implementation of Category 1 elements will begin immediately, with all components monitored continuously by the
Bird Control Unit (BCU) and evaluated at least annually by the Bird Hazard Task Force (BHTF). Category 1 activities
would be continued until the annual reviews of these programs by the BCU and BHTF demonstrate that either Category
1 activities are no longer needed or that additional management is required. The BHTF will suggest improvements to
this program, recommend additional research and monitoring needs and establish criteria to be used for initiation
of Category 2 measures. The FEIS states that the National Park Service (NPS) will initiate steps to satisfy legislative
and procedural requirements, as well as management review for on-colony elements (Category 2) whenever it is demonstrated
that off-colony elements (Category 1) are ineffective. If initiation of Category 2 actions are justified, the NPS
must define actions, analyze impacts and document decisions in the context of legal authorities and management policies
in further NEPA analysis and documentation.
1. Category 1 actions include continued development of JFKIA's on-airport program, reduction of off-airport attractants,
and the on-airport shooting of gulls.
a. Continued development of JFKIA's on-airport program with emphasis upon improvements to the BCU and the BHTF.
(1) Enhance the professional capability of the BCU
(2) Establish in-house capability within the BCU to assess and monitor effectiveness of control programs on target
species.
(3) Prepare written plans for vegetation, insect control, solid waste, water management and other on-airport issues
that address bird hazard management.
(4) Reorganize the BHTF to assist as an independent review body.
These above improvements will, by themselves, likely result in marginal reduction in gull-aircraft interactions.
However, their implementation will improve the decisionmaking and evaluation process and provide a mechanism for
determination of when Category 2 elements need to be considered, while having low environmental impacts (FEIS 5.5
and 6.2.2). The Service Actions within the Preferred Alternative are presented in the Findings and Decisions section.
These Actions explain what improvements to the JFKIA on-airport program will be implemented and when these Actions
will be implemented.
b. Reduction of off-airport attractants (FEIS 5.4.2.4. and 6.2.1).
As the FEIS states at page 6-4, reduction of off-airport attractants can be achieved provided cooperation of
outside agencies can be obtained. Implementation of this program will likely result in a low reduction in gull-aircraft
interactions. However, considering the absence of substantial environmental impacts, it was included as support
to other Category 1 elements.
c. Continue on-airport shooting of gulls (FEIS 5.7 and 6.3.2).
Among on-airport lethal alternatives, only shooting is considered a feasible and effective option. Its environmental
impacts are relatively low, as long as not more than approximately 14,500 laughing gulls are shot annually (according
to ADC in the FEIS, p. 5-42). The on-airport shooting program could affect local and New York State laughing gull populations,
unless another nesting colony is established in the State. Computer simulations indicate regional populations
would not be impacted by an on-airport shooting program restricted to this level.
The impact of the on-airport shooting program on herring, great black-backed and ringbilled gull populations has
been minimal, 

e.g. 

the numbers of these species shot were 508, 128, and 59, respectively, in 1991; 1,338, 150 and 131 in 1992; and 554, 121,
and 169 in 1993. Local, regional and national populations of these gull species would not be adversely impacted by
the on-airport shooting.
2. Category 2 elements include laughing gull nest/egg destruction in Jamaica Bay (FEIS 5.6.1.2.1 and 6.3.1), on-colony
shooting of laughing gulls (FEIS 5.6.2.2. and 6.3.1), and display of synthetic gull models to harass gulls (FEIS 5.4.2.3
and 6.2.1).
If the potential risk to the flying public has been shown not to be reduced to acceptable levels as determined by the
BHTF, the NPS will implement Category 2 control elements within the colony. On-colony actions will be proposed only
after it has been judged that Category 1 actions have not been effective in reducing bird-aircraft interactions at
JFKIA. The FEIS states that if initiation of Category 2 elements are justified, the NPS must define those actions,
analyze those impacts and document its decision in the context of its legal authorities and its management policies
and NEPA.

Other Alternatives Considered



Four alternatives, including the proposed action, were considered in the FEIS.



Alternative II. 

This alternative is the No-Action Alternative (FEIS 6.1), which involves the continuation of JFKIA's on-airport
program (vegetation management, water management, insect control, sanitation management, and BCU programs),
without further expansion, and does not include the intensive on-airport shooting program that was conducted during
the 1991-93 period. The No-Action Alternative will not sufficiently reduce the gull hazard or address the issue
of public safety for the 28 million passengers that use JFKIA each year. Because it is not effective, the No-Action
Alternative is not considered for implementation.



Alternative III. 

This alternative involves implementation of a nonlethal gull hazard control program (FEIS 6.2). Off the airport,
it addresses nesting habitat modification, discouraging use of the laughing gull colony site through harassment,
and reduction of off-airport attractants. On JFKIA, it addresses expansion of the JFKIA on-airport control program.
Overall, this alternative was not selected due to substantial adverse environmental impacts. However, elements
of this alternative were included in the Preferred Alternative.

Of the on-colony habitat modification elements of this alternative, all these elements were considered to present
unacceptable environmental impacts, which cannot be substantially mitigated and are therefore not considered
for selection as preferred alternatives. Those elements included marsh devegetation through moving, herbicide,
burning and excavation.

The only on-colony harassment element was display of synthetic models representing dead gulls. Although this element
would not create substantial adverse ecological environmental impacts it is only moderately effective in reducing
the gull hazard. The display of gull models were included as a Category 2 element of the IMP/DOI.

The reduction of off-airport attractants can be achieved provided cooperation of outside agencies can be obtained.
The effectiveness in reducing gull/aircraft interactions is moderate to low and the environmental impacts of this
element is very low. This element was included as a Category 1 element of the IMP/DOI.

The only on-airport element was the expansion of the existing on-airport program (Section 1.a. of the Preferred Alternative).
The expansion of the existing on-airport program was not considered as a preferred alternative by itself, because
it had a low level of effectiveness. However, this element was included as a Category 1 element of the IMP/DOI.



Alternative IV. 

This alternative involves implementation of a lethal gull hazard control program (FEIS 6.3). Off the airport, it
addresses population reduction of the laughing gull colony, including nest/egg destruction or oiling eggs, and
population reduction of adults. On JFKIA, it addresses shooting and avicide application.

Several on-colony elements were considered. These elements included physical destruction of nests and eggs, oiling
eggs, toxicant application to nesting adults, shooting of adults on the colony site, and introduction of predators
to the nesting colony. None were considered effective enough individually to warrant consideration as a preferred
alternative. However, shooting of adult gulls from blinds, and egg and nest destruction were included as Category
2 elements of the IMP/DOI.

Among JFKIA elements, only shooting was a feasible and effective option. The environmental impacts of this element
for laughing gulls was low, as long as not more than 14,500 are shot annually. Populations of herring, great black-backed
and ring-billed gulls would not be affected by this program. This alternative was included as a Category 1 element
of the IMP/DOI.



Alternative methods.

 Twelve methods for gull hazard management on JFKIA were examined as possible alternatives to the IMP/BOI. These include
planting laughing gull breeding areas with shrubs (FEIS 3.3.1.2), landform alteration by filling marsh (FEIS 3.3.1.3.1),
landform alteration by physical obstruction (monofilament, cordage, or wire barriers) (FEIS 3.3.1.3.3), harassment
of breeding laughing gulls by falconry (FEIS 3.3.2.1), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by dogs (FEIS 3.3.2.2),
harassment of breeding laughing gulls by acoustics (FEIS 3.3.2.3), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by deterrent
display of dead gulls (FEIS 3.3.2.4), harassment of breeding laughing gulls by radio-controlled model airplanes
(FEIS 3.3.2.5), alteration of airport operations (numbers of aircraft using JFKIA, daily distribution of aircraft
using JFKIA and types of aircraft using JFKIA) (FEIS 3.4.2.1), alteration of runway use patterns (FEIS 3.4.2.2),
research and development into aircraft engineering to reduce air strikes (FEIS 3.4.3.2), and bird tracking and warning
devices (FEIS 3.4.3.4). It was concluded that none of these alternatives would be effective in the control of the gull
hazard at JFKIA.



Minimization of Impacts and Public Concerns



The Preferred Alternative incorporates a variety of measures to minimize the adverse environmental, social and
economic impacts as described in the FEIS. Improvements to the bird hazard management program at JFKIA will permit
the continuous monitoring and evaluation of this program. The Preferred Alternative significantly reduces the
threat of bird/aircraft interactions at JFKIA for the 28 million travelers using that airport yearly through the
implementation of the IMP/DOI. The IMP/DOI includes improvement of the on-airport management program and data collected
for the evaluation of the on-airport and off-airport management programs. Specific measures to minimize impacts
of and public concerns about the proposed action are identified in the Findings and Decision section of this document



Service Authority



Statutory authority for the Service's actions is as follows:

Migratory birds listed in treaties with Great Britain (Canada), Mexico, Japan, and the former Soviet Union are protected
and activities involving them are regulated in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The Secretary of
the Interior under 16 United States Code (U.S.C.) Sections 703-712 has responsibility for management of those
migratory birds, including the issuance of permits to take those birds. Criteria for issuance of Special Purpose
permits is further defined by regulations found in Title 50 CFR part 21.

Specifically, 16 U.S.C. 704 provides:




``Subject to the provisions and in order to carry out the purposes of the conventions, the Secretary * * *
is authorized and directed from time to time, having due regard to the zones of temperature and to the distribution,
abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of migratory flight of such birds, to determine,
when, to what extent, if at all, and by what means, it is compatible with the terms of the conventions to allow, * * *
taking * * * of any such bird * * *''.




Generally, all species of gulls are listed in the treaties and further identified in 50 CFR 10.13, List of Migratory
Birds. Prohibited activities involving these listed migratory birds are more clearly identified in 50 CFR 21.11
which provides: ``No person shall take * * * any migratory bird * * * except as permitted
under the terms of a valid permit * * *''.

The regulations then provide for issuance of permits for general standardized activities (import/export, banding
and marking, scientific collecting, taxidermy, waterfowl sale and disposal, and falconry activities) utilizing
standard form permits. They also provide for issuance of Special Purpose permits which authorize otherwise prohibited
activities involving migratory birds, not otherwise covered by the standard form permits, when: ``* * *
an applicant * * * submits a written application containing the general information and certification
required by part 13 [50 CFR 13] and makes a sufficient showing of * * * compelling justification.''
(50 CFR 21.27)

These Special Purpose Permit regulations give the Service broad authorities to address human safety issues at JFKIA.
The Preferred Alternative is compatible with all conventions and treaties and the Service Actions identified within
this Preferred Alternative are compatible with the intent of these conventions, treaties, and associated regulations.
The compelling justification for these Service Actions is the issue of human safety at JFKIA.



Service Actions



On May 24, 1994 the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) made a declaration ``* * * that in the opinion of
the Federal Aviation Authority an `urgent situation' exists at JFK which requires emergency actions which are necessary
on a limited and temporary basis for the protection of life, health, and property or natural resources.'' As of this
time, there is no effective short-term alternative to address the public safety risk presented by gulls within JFKIA
airspace, except to permit limited shooting of gulls at the airport. As is explained below, the Service intends to
permit shooting to proceed in May 1994, subject to certain permit conditions.



1994 Actions. 

The Service will issue Special Purpose Permits to ADC to permit the 1994 shooting program and to PA to permit the 1994
BCU program. Both permits will be non-renewable and ADC's permit will expire on August 20, 1994, by which time the peak
of laughing gull strikes can reasonably be expected to have diminished. The PA's permit will expire on October 1, 1994,
as is discussed in greater detail below. Non-renewable means that activity ends when the permit expires, and another
permit must be issued before the activity can be continued (Title 50 CFR 13.22).

The Service will take this action on the ADC permit, in consideration of the FAA's determination of a need for emergency
actions at JFKIA and the information presented in the FEIS concerning the hazards presented by gulls at JFKIA. The
Service will issue the ADC permit, after the Service has concurred with documentation provided by ADC that the number
of birds flying into JFKIA airspace present a hazard to aircraft.

The Service will condition the PA permit to authorize PA personnel to (1) kill non-endangered and non-threatened
species of migratory birds, except eagles and all species of gulls, as provided by 50 CFR 21.41 (c)(2), when they are
creating or about to create a hazard to aircraft; (2) all carcasses collected under this permit must be donated to a
public/scientific institution or destroyed by burial/incineration; and (3) maintain records as required per 50
CFR 13.46. This gull restriction in the PA permit is based upon a State of New York limitation. The Service will condition
the ADC permit to authorize ADC personnel to (1) kill no more than 14,500 laughing gulls, 1,500 herring, 200 great black-backed
and 200 ring-billed gulls, when found flying into JFKIA airspace and creating a hazard to aircraft, using shotguns
with steel shot; (2) all specimens collected under this permit must be donated to a public/scientific institution
or destroyed by burial/incineration; and (3) maintain records as required per 50 CFR 13.46. The validity of both permits
is also conditioned upon strict observance of all applicable foreign, state, local or other Federal law.

The restrictions placed upon the take of herring, black-backed, and ring-billed gulls under the 1994 ADC permit reflect
approximate past performance under the 1991-93 permits, because these takes have been demonstrated to have
no impacts on local, state, or regional populations (FEIS, pp. 3-92 to 3-93). The restriction for shooting
no more than 14,500 laughing gulls for the 1994 ADC permit is based on the results of population modeling (FEIS pp. 3-4
to 3-9 and p. 5-42) which suggests that the current Massachusetts/New York/New Jersey population could
sustain a maximum annual loss of approximately 14,500 birds to shooting every year.

The Service will entertain an application from the PA for a Special Use Permit to support the activities of their BCU
for the remainder of 1994 provided that they have agreed to the improvements to the BCU, BHTF and JFKIA management programs
and the schedule for these improvements to be completed on or before September 15, 1994. The Service will monitor the
compliance of the PA to implementation of these improvements. Future permits will not be issued if improvements are
not implemented according to the implementation schedule.

Consistent with IMP/DOI policy to enhance the professional capability of the BCU and to establish capability within
the BCU to assess and monitor the effectiveness of control programs on target species, the Service has determined
that the PA must fundamentally change the staff, functions and size of the existing BCU to insure that the BCU's capabilities
and functions are improved prior to any application by the ADC or the PA for any permit for 1995. The Service has determined
that the time frames set forth in Section 6.4.3.2 are inadequate. Therefore the Service has determined that the following
measures shall be implemented by the dates set forth below:

1. Enhance the professional capability of the BCU.

The PA will hire a person trained in ornithology, or wildlife biology, or in a related field as the supervisor for the
BCU by August 1, 1994. This supervisor will be trained to the Master of Science level in either ornithology or wildlife
biology and will be capable of developing and evaluating the bird hazard management program at JFKIA and developing
monitoring programs for birds in the JFKIA area.

The PA must apply to the Service for the October 1994 BCU permit by September 15, 1994, and should indicate in its application
how it has complied with hiring the BCU supervisory biologist (

#

1 above) and the reorganization of the BHTF. With this application the PA may include its assessment of the BCU's personnel
capabilities and expertise. This assessment, if provided, should address needs for increases in staff size, changes
in professional capabilities of staff, and training. It should also identify BCU equipment and support requirements,
as well as document how the BCU will conduct the collection of biological field data, surveys and monitoring programs
described in the IMP/DOI and this document.


2. Reorganize the BHTF to assist as an independent review body.

The PA will reorganize the BHTF to serve as an advisory committee to the Port Authority for the evaluation of the BCU
program and the gull shooting program by August 1, 1994. The BHTF will suggest improvements to this program, recommend
additional research and monitoring needs and establish criteria to be used for initiation of Category 2 measures.
The agencies currently composing the BHTF would remain. The chairmanship would be rotated on an annual basis; however,
the Service would chair the task force during this reorganization period.

On May 17, 1994, the Port Authority provided the Service with a letter indicating significant disagreement concerning
those measures needed to implement the IMP/DOI. The Service wants a competent, professional, fully-staffed BCU
in place before the Spring of 1995. Based upon the Service's evaluation of the current capabilities of the BCU and the
improvements required to implement the IMP/DOI, the Service has identified additional organizational improvements.
The Service will evaluate subsequent requests for special permits in light of the PA's implementation of the tasks
set forth above, the measures described below, advice from the BHTF, and any other information submitted by the PA.
Additional measures to improve the capabilities of the BCU include the following:


1. Additional enhancement of the professional capability of the BCU.

The PA will increase staff size for the BCU to 10 permanent, full-time members by November 1, 1994. All BCU employees
will be qualified to consistently and accurately collect biological field data and to conduct surveys and monitoring
programs with the minimum professional training of a Bachelors of Science or equivalent substantive course work
and field experience. The BCU will include at least one person trained in entomology and pesticides.

The PA will provide sufficient equipment and vehicles to support the improved BCU by November 15, 1994. This includes
equipment to disperse water following rain storms, pyrotechnics, speaker systems in all vehicles, firearms, and
safety equipment.

The PA will train and authorize all BCU employees to conduct all harassment methods, including the firing of firearms
for lethal and non-lethal harassment by November 15, 1994. This includes the development of a training plan for all
employees.

<TEXT>
 

The BCU staff requires 7 people to perform its bird harassment responsibilities (1 supervisor, 2 employees per shift,
2 shifts per day, 7 days a week). In order to incresae the capability of the BCU, the Service has determined that three
additional people are required, as well as improving the professional training and capabilities of the BCU and assuring
that the BCU is adequately equipped to do its job.
2. Establish in-house capability within the BCU to assess and monitor effectiveness of control programs on target
species.
On or before January 31, 1995, the PA will develop and implement monitoring programs to assess the following:
(1) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the gull shooting program and JFKIA's bird hazard management program; 
(2) Identification of criteria that could be used to determine when a gull shooting program should begin or end;
(3) Identification of criteria, with the involvement of the BHTF, that could be used to determine when Category 1 elements
have become ineffective;
(4) Evaluation of off-airport attractants that encourage gulls to fly through JFKIA airspace; and
(5) Continuing evaluation of potential on-airport attractants.
3. Prepare written plans for vegetation, insect control, solid waste, water management and other on-airport issues
that address bird hazard management.
The PA will produce written management plans for vegetation, insect, water, and solid waste management on JFKIA by
December 29, 1994. These plans will document the existing programs and the overall management strategies for these
programs.
The Service has determined that these written plans are needed as part of the Service's monitoring and enforcement
program for this permit. The PA has actively addressed these management issues on JFKIA, as documented in FEIS (Section
3.2); however, poor documentation for these programs makes interpretation and monitoring impossible at this time.
4. As a part of the effort to develop data on bird species contributing to hazards at JFKIA and to a determination of when
Category 2 measures may be appropriate, the NPS is committed to participating in seasonal surveys in 1994 to monitor
gull populations and distribution in the Jamaica Bay area and will provide these data to the BCU and BHTF.


1995 Actions. 

For the 1994-95 period, the Service will monitor the above described implementation schedule and will not consider
applications for Special Purpose Permits for either the PA or ADC in 1995, unless all of the above specified improvements
are implemented according to the above schedule or unless a deviation from these conditions has been expressly permitted
by the Service.
The Service has ascertained that these specific improvements are needed under the IMP/DOI element dealing with continued
development of JFKIA's on-airport program. The Service has determined that these programs are needed to support
the Service's monitoring and enforcement program for this permit. These improvements will, by themselves, likely
result in a marginal reduction in gull-aircraft interactions. However, their implementation will improve the decision-making
and evaluation process, and will provide a mechanism for determination of when Category 2 elements need to be considered.
In addition, the NPS has committed to participate in seasonal surveys in 1995 to monitor gull populations and distribution
in the Jamaica Bay area, as part of this program, and will provide these data to the BCU and BHTF to support this monitoring
and enforcement program.


1996 Actions. 

In 1996 and subsequent years, the Service will review data collected by the BCU and recommendations made by the BHTF,
as part of the annual review process for issuance of Special Purpose Permits. These future permit decisions and any
restrictions placed upon future permits will be guided by this improved data collection and analysis system implemented
by the PA for JFKIA in 1994.


Findings and Decisions


Having reviewed and considered the FEIS for the gull hazard management program at JFKIA and the public comments thereon,
the Service finds as follows:
1. The requirements of NEPA and implementing regulations have been satisfied; and 
2. Consistent with social, economic, programmatic and environmental considerations from among the reasonable
alternative thereto, the Preferred Action alternative with the Service's conditions described above is one which
minimizes or avoids adverse environmental effects to the maximum extent practicable, including the effects discussed
in the FEIS; and,
3. Consistent with the social, economic and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable,
adverse environmental effects revealed in the EIS process will be minimized or avoided by incorporating as conditions
those mitigative measures identified in the Preferred Alternative in the FEIS and its supporting appendices; and,
4. The limitations on the numbers of gulls which may be taken under this permit are compatible with the terms of the Migratory
Bird Conventions and are made with due regard to their distribution, abdundance, breeding habits, and migratory

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of the Joint Draft Environmental Assessment and Draft Restoration Plan for the John Day River
Acid Spill</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla
Indian Reservation (hereafter known as the Trustees) announce the availability of the Joint Draft Environmental
Assessment and Draft Restoration Plan for the John Day River Acid Spill (DEA/Plan) for public review. The Trustees
are proposing to restore natural resources injured as a result of the 1990 John Day River acid spill. Public comments
are invited pursuant to applicable National Environmental Policy Act regulations and Department of the Interior
Natural Resource Damage Assessment regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On February 8, 1990, a tanker truck owned and operated by Thatcher Trucking Company of Salt Lake City, Utah skidded
off Highway 395 and rolled down an embankment into the North Fork of the John Day River in north-central Oregon. An estimated
3,500 gallons, or 33,500 pounds, of hydrochloric acid was discharged into the river and flowed downstream at an approximate
rate of one mile per hour.



The spill drastically changed the pH of the river water resulting in extensive mortality and injury to fish resources.
An estimated 98,000 to 145,000 fish were destroyed, including 4,000 anadromous fish, 300 bull trout, and 9,500 Pacific
lampery. Additionally, 50 percent of the chinook salmon alevins were estimated to have been killed. Aquatic mammals,
waterfowl, and endangered species, which utilize the John Day River Basin, may also have been directly or indirectly
impacted by the spill.

In 1992, the United States of America, State of Oregon, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation
settled claims for natural resource damages associated with the 1990 John Day River acid spill. The claims were settled
by consent decree under Section 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
as amended. The consent decree established a $275,000 Trust Fund for use only for restoration, replacement, or acquisition
of equivalent resources injured by the spill.

A Restoration Committee, comprised of a representative from each Trustee, was established to review and select restoration
actions. The following strategies and alternatives were developed by the Restoration Committee: (1) Permanent
Protection_land acquisition and perpetual easements, leases, or covenants; (2) Temporary Protection_easements,
leases, or management rights; (3) Habitat Enhancement_riparian habitat restoration, instream habitat improvement
measures, and watershed improvement measures; (4) Combined Protection and Enhancement_all alternatives previously
listed; and (5) No Action_unmitigated action.

In order to maximize recovery of injured resources, the Restoration Committee selected the Combined Protection
and Enhancement Strategy. In selecting this strategy, the Trustees emphasis on the selection of restoration projects
was on Permanent Protection followed by Temporary Protection and then Habitat Enhancement projects. Selected projects
include the following; land acquisition, permanent easements, riparian habitat protection, riparian habitat
restoration, instream habitat enhancement, erosion control, and watershed restoration. These projects are outlined
in the DEA/Plan and would be implemented on the North Fork, Middle Fork, and other tributaries of the John Day River.
The primary criteria for the selection of projects was based on the project's potential to restore resources injured
by this spill. The Restoration Committee is also actively seeking matching funds for restoration projects in order
to enhance selected projects or implement additional projects. Potential cost-share organizations include the
U.S. Forest Service, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Nature Conservancy, and the Bonneville Power
Administration, among others.

Interested members of the public are invited to review and comment on the DEA/Plan and to provide additional alternatives
and projects. Copies of the DEA/Plan are available for review at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Ecological Services
Field Office (2600 S.E. 98th Avenue, suite 100, Portland, Oregon), the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's John
Day District Office (305 North Canyon Boulevard, Canyon City, Oregon), and the Grant County Library (507 South Canyon
Boulevard, John Day, Oregon). Copies of the DEA/Plan may be obtained at the aforementioned U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service Office. All written comments will be considered and addressed in the final agency determination.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan Proposed Establishment of
Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge Lauderdale County, Alabama</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the Proposed Establishment
of Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Region, proposes to establish a
national wildlife refuge in the vicinity of Lauderdale County, Alabama. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect
and manage up to 2,300 acres of land to ensure the biological integrity of Key Cave, which has been designated by the
Service as critical habitat for the endangered Alabama cavefish and as a priority one maternity cave for the endangered
gray bat. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has been developed by
Service biologists in coordination with the Tennessee Valley authority, the State of Alabama, the Soil Conservation
Service, The Conservation Fund, the Wildlife Enhancement Council, and Monsanto, Inc. The assessment considers
the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates
three alternative actions and their potential impacts on the environment. Written comments or recommendations
concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent to the address below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The primary objective of the proposed Key Cave National Wildlife Refuge are to (1) protect habitat for threatened
and endangered species, (2) promote habitat for threatened and endangered species, (2) promote habitat for a natural
diversity of wildlife, (3) enhance habitat for nongame migratory birds, and (4) provide opportunities for compatible
outdoor recreation and environmental education and interpretation.




The proposed refuge area is located in northwest Alabama, about 5 miles southwest of Florence, the county seat and
largest city in Lauderdale County. The cave lies on the northern shore of Pickwick Lake in a limestone karst area that
contains numerous sinkholes and several underground cave systems. The area's sinkholes form an integral part of
the groundwater recharge to the caves.

The proposed refuge would consist of about 1,500 acres of land acquired in fee title, with an additional 800 acres of
sinkholes in the cave's recharge area protected through conservation easements with willing landowners.

The major wildlife values are the two endangered species which inhabit Key Cave: the Alabama cavefish (

Speoplatyrhinus poulsom

) and the gray bat (

Myotis grisescens

). Key Cave is used as a summer maternity cave by the gray bat. Because of its highly specific habitat and roost requirements,
fewer than 5 percent of the available caves in the animal's range are suitable for gray bat occupation. The flightless
young bats roost in Key Cave from late May to mid-July, and thousands could die from a single human disturbance or act
of vandalism.

The Alabama cavefish has been found to exist only in Key Cave. Just nine specimens are known to exist in scientific collections.
No other populations of this species are known. Based on its apparent distribution, the number of specimens collected,
and the number of individuals observed, this small fish appears to be the rarest of American cavefish and one of the
rarest of all freshwater fish. Its habitat in Key Cave is threatened by human disturbance, groundwater degradation,
alternations in the area's drainage and hydrologic patterns, lowered groundwater levels, and diminished organic
matter inputs.

Both the Gray Bat Recovery Plan and the Alabama Cavefish Recovery Plan identify land acquisition as the primary means
for protecting Key Cave, and both list that protection as a priority one task. Because the proposed Key Cave refuge
is identified as critical habitat for the Alabama cavefish and as a priority one maternity cave for the gray bat, land
acquisition would be sought under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543).

Notice of availability and public comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency draft recovery
plan for large-flowered skullcap. Large-flowered skullcap (

Scutellaria montana

 Chapman) is an herbaceous representative of the mint family (Lamiaceae), with known populations in northern Georgia
and southeastern Tennessee. The Service solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort,
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

Based upon available information concerning the range, biology, and threats to its continued survival, it is not
yet possible to determine if or when full recovery of the large-flowered skullcap is possible. Accordingly, this
draft recovery plan outlines a mechanism that provides for the protection and maintenance of all known populations,
with emphasis on determining autecological factors necessary to manage the species. In 1986 the taxon was listed
as endangered by the Service. At that time there were seven populations known in Georgia and three in Tennessee. The
taxon was threatened by habitat loss to timbering or development. Over 90 percent of the 7,000 individual plants known
in 1986 occurred at only two sites, neither of which was completely protected from known threats. Currently, large-flowered
skullcap is known to occur in two counties in Tennessee and four counties in Georgia, within a limited area of the Ridge
and Valley and Cumberland Plateau provinces. There are 17 extant populations (12 in Tennessee and 5 in Georgia) that
vary greatly in size. Comments and information provided during this review will be used in preparing the final recovery
plan.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the plan.



Authority



The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f)

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions, shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

 or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under the Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

the folk and traditional arts in America, including an examination of its art forms, artists, audiences, and arts
organizations; the growth in the quantity of this activity in the last 15 years; and an overview of how this activity
is supported through public arts agencies and through folk and traditional arts organizations themselves. It is
anticipated that the project will entail ten case studies; identification, compilation, and analysis of secondary
data on cultural and ethnic diversity; and interviews with Folk and Traditional Arts Organizations. Those interested
in receiving the Solicitation package should reference Program Solicitation PS 94-10 in their written request

<USDEPT>NATIONAL INDIAN GAMING COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notice of Approval of Class III Tribal Gaming Ordinances</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Indian Gaming Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval of class III gaming ordinances.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of class III gaming ordinances approved by the Chairman of the National
Indian Gaming Commission.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 

et seq.

, was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 

Federal Register

, approved class III gaming ordinances.




The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the 

Federal Register

 would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a
notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., NW., suite 250, Washington, DC 20036.



The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes:




Big Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians
Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation
Crow Creek Sioux Tribe
Elem Indian Colony
Jicarilla Apache Tribe
Kickapoo Traditional Tribe of Texas
Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians
Moapa Band of Paiutes
Rosebud Sioux Tribe
Temecula Band of Luiseno Mission Indians
Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians
Wisconsin Winnebago Nation

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Patriots Point Development Authority; U.S. Maritime Administration; N.S. SAVANNAH; Environmental Assessment
and Finding of no Significant Impact Regarding License Amendment</DOCTITLE>







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is considering issuance of an amendment to the Amended Facility License
No. NS-1 issued to the Patriots Point Development Authority (PPDA) and the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD)
for possession but not operation of the nuclear reactor facility aboard the 

N.S. Savannah.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



By application dated May 19, 1994, as supplemented by letters dated May 24, and May 25, 1994, PPDA and MARAD requested
authorization to (1) delete the PPDA as a co-licensee, allow relocation of the N.S. Savannah

 to the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), (2) change responsibility for the performance of radiological health physics
coverage, surveillance and response to the U.S. Army Center for Public Works, Humphries Engineering Center, (3)
change the composition of the Review and Audit Committee to be consistent with the deletion of PPDA as a co-licensee,
and (4) make other minor changes and discontinue public access to the facility. PPDA has decided to discontinue use
of the ship as a museum exhibit and return the ship to MARAD, which has retained ownership. The ship was removed from
the PPDA pier on May 24, 1994, under the existing license. The ship will be towed to Baltimore, Maryland, for drydock
repairs, also under the existing license. The ship will then be relocated to the JRRF, near Fort Eustis, Virginia for
long term storage.



Need for Proposed Action



The proposed action is needed in order to remove the PPDA as co-licensee, to relocate the 

N.S. Savannah

 to the JRRF, near Fort Eustis, Virginia, for long term storage following repairs in drydock, and to change Technical
Specifications consistent with these changes in licensee and location.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The potential environmental impact associated with this action is the relocation of the ship to the JRRF for long term
storage.

With regard to potential radiological impacts, twenty two years ago, the reactor was defueled, the control rods were
disengaged from their mechanisms, primary system pump rotors were removed from the pumps and other physical changes
were performed to make the reactor permanently inoperable. Core internals and primary system piping and components
are entombed within the heavily shielded containment vessel which is sealed. No additional radioactivity will be
produced, and the existing residual radioactivity will continue to decrease by radioactive decay. From 1981 until
1993, the ship was open to the public as a museum with no measurable radiation exposure to any member of the public. To
prevent public access to potential contaminated or radiation areas in the ship, these areas will continue to be sealed
and security for the ship will be maintained at the JRRF effectively similar to that in place at the PPDA pier.

In the unlikely event that radioactive waste is produced on the ship, all waste will be removed, packaged, and shipped
offsite, or released in accordance with radiological control procedures that are in place and implemented to ensure
that releases of radioactive wastes from the facility are within the limits of 10 CFR part 20 and are as low as reasonably
achievable (ALARA).

Based on the review of the proposed activities associated with the license amendment for the 

N.S. Savannah

, the staff has determined that there will be no significant increase in the amounts of effluents that may be released
offsite, and no significant increase in individual or cumulative occupational or population radiation exposure.
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental
impact.

With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, after leaving drydock, the 

N.S. Savannah

 will be towed to the JRRF using established navigation channels. It will be located within the existing boundary of
the Reserve Fleet in the James River. No extensive preparation to the site will be required for the 

N.S. Savannah

. It is intended to moor the 

N.S. Savannah

 alongside the decommissioned U.S. Army Corps of Engineers MH-1A Floating Nuclear Power Barge Sturgis.

The staff has determined that the proposed activities will not result in any significant impacts on air, water, land,
or biota in the area or have any other significant non-radiological environmental impact.

Based on the above, the Commission concludes that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with
the proposed amendment.



Alternatives to the Proposed Actions



Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed
action, any alternative with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.

The principal alternative to the proposed amendment request would be to deny the request. This denial would force
the PPDA to remain as a co-licensee and the ship to be returned to the PPDA pier. However, the PPDA returned the ship to
the MARAD in accordance with the charter agreement and the authorizing legislation (Pub. L. 96-311, August
28, 1980).



Alternative Use of Resources



No alternatives appear that will have different or lesser effect on the use of available resources.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted the U.S. Coast Guard, and the States of South Carolina and Virginia in reviewing the request
from the licensees.



Finding Of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed action based upon
the foregoing environmental assessment. The Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment for the reasons set out above.

For detailed information with respect to this proposed action, see the application for amendment dated May 19, 1994,
as supplemented by letters dated May 24, and May 25, 1994. These documents are available for public inspection at the
Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Addition of Options Series at 21/2 Point Strike Price Intervals for Major Market Index Options



May 27, 1994.



On November 27, 1991, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to alter its strike price policy in order to introduce near-the-money
 options series on the XMI at 21/2-point strike (exercise) price intervals.









Notice of the proposal was published for comment and appeared in the 

Federal Register 

on January 15, 1993.
 No Comments were received on the proposed rule change.





In 1983, when the Exchange began trading index options, options series were introduced in 5-point strike price intervals
for index values up to 200 and 10-point increments for index values above 200. Subsequently, the Exchange obtained
Commission approval to list index options with 5-point strike price intervals when the value of the relevant index
is above 200.
 The Amex continues to follow this policy for all of the Exchange's index options with expirations up to one year; for
longer-term index options, the Exchange may have strike price intervals as wide as 25 or 50 points.





The Amex proposes to amend its strike price policy to allow the Exchange to list near-the-money options on the XMI at
21/2-point strike price intervals. The Amex has found that the current policy of 5-point strike intervals frequently
results in in-the-money options that are often ``too costly'' and out-of-the money options that yield too little
premium to attract uncovered or covered writers. The Amex believes that the proposal to narrow strike price intervals
by increasing the number of available near-the-money strike prices will enable customers to more finely tailor their
options positions to achieve their intended investment objectives. In addition, the Amex believes that providing
customers with greater opportunities and flexibility will further enhance the depth and liquidity of the Amex's
index options markets.

The Amex also believes, in connection with the reduction of the XMI to one-half its previous value,
 that the addition of 21/2-point strike intervals for near-the-money options will satisfy requests by investors
to maintain the pre-split ``Index-to-strike price ratio'' (

e.g., 

from a 640 Index value with 5-point strike price intervals to a 320 Index value with 21/2-point strike price intervals).





The Amex believes that the proposal will not result in a proliferation of strike prices since the 21/2-point intervals
will only be added to surround the XMI's current Index value. For this purpose, 21/2 point strikes would only be added
10 points above or below the current Index value.
 In addition, the Amex represents that listing near-the-money XMI options series at 21/2 point price intervals will
not adversely impact the capacity of OPRA or market information vendors. In this regard, the Amex notes that the OPRA
system was upgraded in early November 1992 to accommodate up to 300 messages per second (``MPS''). The Exchange believes
that this capacity is more than sufficient to accommodate the requirements of all OPRA participants, including the
proposed 21/2 point strike prices for the XMI, since the recent peaks in message traffic for all OPRA participants
combined have been in the range of 100-125 MPS. In addition, the Amex believes that the additional options series
necessitated by the proposed 21/2 point strike prices for the XMI will have no impact on the ability of vendors to receive
and process data.







The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed listing of 21/2 point strike price intervals for near-the-money
XMI options will provide investors with more flexibility in the trading of XMI options, thereby protecting investors
and furthering the public interest by allowing investors to establish XMI options positions that are better tailored
to meet their investment objectives.





The Commission also believes that the Amex's proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the Exchange's need to
accommodate the needs of investors and the need to avoid the excessive proliferation of options series. Specifically,
the Commission believes that by limiting the number of additional strikes to within 10 points above or below the current
Index value, the Amex's proposal permits a fairly small absolute increase in the number of XMI strikes that may be outstanding
at any one time. Further, the Commission notes that the proposal sets the maximum permissible number of additional
21/2 point strikes; the Amex retains discretion to list fewer strike prices than allowed.

<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00124 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00080 </PARENT>

In addition, the Commission notes that the Amex has represented that there is customer interest in 21/2 strikes for
near-the-money XMI options. Specifically, the Exchange has stated that the existing 5-point strike intervals frequently
result in in-the-money options that are ``too costly'' and out-of-the money options that yield too little premium
to attract uncovered or covered writers. Moreover, the Amex believes that the proposed 21/2 point strike intervals
will satisfy requests by investors to maintain the pre-split ``Index-to-strike price ratio'' of the XMI. In light
of the investor interest in the 21/2 price strikes, and the proposal's limit on the number of strikes the Amex may list,
the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the Amex with the flexibility to list additional strike
prices in near-the-money XMI options in response to genuine customer interest and, at the same time, appropriately
limit the number of XMI options series that may be outstanding at any one time. Finally, based on representations from
OPRA,
 the Commission is satisfied that the Amex and OPRA will have adequate computer processing capacity to accommodate
the trading and quote dissemination demands of the additional strike prices that may be listed under the proposal.






In summary, the Commission believes that the benefits to be derived from the proposal in accommodating the needs and
objectives of investors outweigh the possible adverse effects on market liquidity due to the dispersion of trading
interest in more XMI options series. In making this determination, the Commission notes that the change is limited
to near-the-money series in XMI options only. Nevertheless, the Commission expects the Amex to monitor additional
strikes added under this proposal to ensure that there are no detrimental effects on the market for XMI options.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19 (b) (2) of the Act, 
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-91-31) is approved.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to the Submission of Options Transaction Data for Trade Recording and Price Reporting Purposes</DOCTITLE>



May 27, 1994.



On January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 6.51, ``Reporting Duties,'' Interpretation and Policy .01, to allow members to submit
options transaction data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes through an electronic
data storage medium approved by the Exchange.








The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33730 (March 8, 1994), 59
FR 11814. No comments were received on the proposed rule change.

Currently, CBOE Rule 6.51, Interpretation and Policy .01, requires both the buyer and the seller in a transaction
to record on a card or ticket information concerning the transaction, including the buyer's or seller's assigned
broker initial code and his clearing firm (if a market maker), the symbol of the underlying security, the type, expiration
month and exercise price of the option contract, the transaction price, the number of contract units comprising the
transaction, the time of the transaction, the name of the contra clearing firm member and the assigned broker initial
code of the contra member. Under Interpretation and Policy .01, this information constitutes the ``transaction
record.'' The CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow members to submit options transaction
data to the Exchange for trade recording and price reporting purposes through an electronic data storage medium approved
by the Exchange.

Under current CBOE Rule 6.51, Interpretation and Policy .01, buyers and sellers must submit transaction data in paper
form only, either on a trade ticket or transaction card. The CBOE believes that in today's market and operations technology
environment, that limitation is unduly restrictive, and some CBOE members have requested the opportunity to submit
transaction record data by means of electronic data transmission. Submission in that form would enable those members
to enjoy the efficiency of reporting trades and prices to the CBOE through the same automated medium they use to report
that information to their clearing firms. Accordingly, the CBOE seeks authority to approve particular electronic
media in addition to paper that CBOE members may use for trade recording and price reporting purposes.

In administering the proposed rule change, the CBOE states that the Exchange will from time to time identify particular
electronic media and formats acceptable for use under Exchange Rule 6.51 based on members' needs, and will inform
members about acceptable media and formats through appropriate circulars. The CBOE expects to identify as acceptable
only those electronic media that involve secure and tested technology. 

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to facilitate cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
the clearance and settlement of securities transactions, consistent with the protection of investors and the public
interest. 

The Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b)(5)
and section 17A(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the CBOE's proposal will provide buyers and sellers on the CBOE with an
efficient and accurate means of recording options transactions and submitting price reporting information to the
CBOE with an efficient and accurate means of recording options transactions and submitting price reporting information
to the CBOE while preserving the CBOE's ability to create necessary and reliable audit trail information. The Commission
believes that the electronic submission of transaction data should help to ensure the accuracy of the CBOE's audit
trails by reducing the possibility of human error.
 In turn, the audit trail information should help the CBOE to enforce compliance by its members with the federal securities
laws and the CBOE's rules, thereby increasing the CBOE's ability to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices, promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest, consistent
with section 6(b)(5) of the Act. Moreover, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with section 17A(a)(1)(A)
of the Act because it is designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.







In addition, the CBOE has represented that it will approve only those electronic media that involve secure and tested
technology for submitting options transaction data under CBOE Rule 6.51. The Commission expects the CBOE to notify
the Commission of any changes in the technology approved by the Exchange for submitting options transaction data.


It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-01) is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Modification of Fees for Failure to Observe OEX RAES Requirements</DOCTITLE>



May 27, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change






Currently, CBOE Rule 24.17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,'' establishes eligibility standards under which individuals,
member organizations, and joint accounts may participate in the CBOE's Retail Automatic Execution System (''RAES'')
for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 24.17(a)(iii) to provide
that an individual required to sign onto RAES immediately prior to expiration may apply to the OEX Floor Procedure
Committee (``OFPC'') for prospective relief from the log-on requirements during a particular expiration cycle.
The CBOE also proposes to delete paragraph (iv), which states, among other things, that a member's failure to meet
his RAES obligations will disqualify him from signing onto RAES for such time period as the OFPC determines. In addition,
the CBOE proposes to replace the current $500.00 fee for failing to comply with CBOE rule 24.17's log-on and log-off
requirements with the following fee schedule: (1) A fee of $100.00 for one to three failures within one calendar year;
(2) a fee of $250.00 for four to six failures within one calendar year; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for seven or more failures
within one calendar year. Finally, the CBOE proposes to assess a fee for any joint account member or nominee of a member
organization who has logged onto RAES and later terminates participation on RAES at any time prior to the next succeeding
expiration date, unless the member participates in another OEX RAES account or terminates his membership with the
Exchange.


The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change






In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to eliminate the automatic disqualification provisions
in CBOE Rule 24.17 and to reduce the fees now required of members under that rule for failure to observe the rule's log-on
and log-off requirements. In addition, the proposal makes certain editorial changes to clarify CBOE Rule 24.17 without
affecting its substance.


In May 1993, Exchange Rule 24.17 was amended to establish, among other things, more rigorous log-on and log-off requirements
for participants in OEX RAES.
 For example, group members who previously were logged on automatically by the Exchange must now log on at their own
initiative each time they enter the trading crowd. Likewise, members who previously were not required to log off the
system each time they left the trading crowd must now do so.






In view of such additional log-on and log-off requirements, the Exchange believes that the $500.00 fees currently
due from members who do not log on or log off as required are excessive. The proposed rule change therefore establishes
a new graduated fee schedule, under which the fee amount will increase in relation to the number of times within any
one calendar year that a member does not log on or log off as required. Specifically, during each calendar year, a $100.00
fee will be due for each of the first three times that a member fails to observe the log-on or log-off requirements; a
$250.00 fee will be due for each of the fourth through sixth such times; and a $500.00 fee will be due for all subsequent
times. In addition, the CBOE proposes to assess a $500.00 fee on any member participating in a joint account or nominee
account held by a member organization if the member logs onto OEX RAES but thereafter terminates participation prior
to the next succeeding expiration date without either joining another OEX RAES account or terminating membership
on the Exchange.




Members who fail to observe CBOE Rule 24.17 can be subject to a variety of sanctions.
 The CBOE states that the fees suggested in the proposed rule change, like the fees imposed currently under CBOE Rule
24.17, do not constitute disciplinary action. Nevertheless, the review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings and
Review,'' of the Exchange's rules will be available with respect to the assessment of the proposed fees. Under those
procedures, a member may seek verification of fees charged by the Exchange. If the member is not satisfied with the
verification of fees, he may request a hearing before a panel of three or more members of the Exchange's Appeals Committee.
At the hearing the appellant may be represented by counsel and may cross-examine witnesses.

In addition, the decision of the Exchange's Appeals Committee panel is subject to review by the Board of Directors
of the Exchange on the Board's own motion, on the written request of the appellant, or at the request of the Exchange's
President or the relevant Exchange Committee Chairman. The review must be conducted by the Board or by a Board Committee
consisting of at least three Directors (other than Directors who sat on the Appeals Committee in the matter). An appellant
has an opportunity to address issues raised specifically by the Board or the Committee, and in addition may submit
oral or written arguments if the Board so allows in its discretion.





The CBOE states that in a related context the Commission has noted the appropriateness of fees like those proposed
herein, particularly when coupled with appeal rights. Specifically, in approving a CBOE proposal that included
procedures for contesting the fees assessed for delayed submission of trade data, the Commission stated that ``Although
such formalized procedures are unusual for challenging fee assessments, they actually make the imposition of the
fee fairer by allowing members to challenge erroneous fee charges. Moreover, these procedures are reasonably designed
to afford a member assessed a fee the opportunity to challenge the veracity of the assessments.''





The Exchange believes that the proposed fee schedule is appropriate and equitable given the additional requirements
imposed on participants in OEX RAES in the RAES Fee Approval Order. Furthermore, to ensure that all members are treated
alike under the RAES Fee Approval Order, the Exchange will apply the revised fee schedule retroactively from April
30, 1993, the effective date of the RAES Fee Approval Order.
The proposal also deletes the automatic disqualification provisions that appear in current CBOE Rules 24.17(a)(iv),
(b)(vii), and (c)(viii). The CBOE believes these deletions are appropriate in view of the new requirements imposed
under the RAES Fee Approval Order and the fee structure imposed hereunder.
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to allocate reasonable dues,
fees and charges among CBOE members and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the CBOE's automatic execution
system.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions

The Southern Company, et al. (70-7932) 

 

The Southern Company (``Southern''), 64 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, Georgia 30346, a registered holding company,
its wholly owned nonutility subsidiary companies, Southern Electric International, Inc. (``SEI''), 900 Ashwood
Parkway, Suite 500, Atlanta, Georgia 30338 and Southern Company Services, Inc. (``SCS''), 64 Perimeter Center East,
Atlanta, Georgia 30346, and Southern's operating electric utility subsidiary companies Southern Nuclear Operating
Company, 42 Inverness Center Parkway, Birmingham, Alabama 36242, Alabama Power Company, 600 Piedmont Avenue NE.,
Atlanta, Georgia 30308; Mississippi Power Company, 2992 West Beach, Gulfport, Mississippi 39501; Georgia Power
Company, 333 Piedmont Avenue NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30308; Gulf Power Company, 500 Bayfront Parkway, Pensacola,
Florida 32501; and Savannah Electric and Power Company (``Savannah''), 600 Bay Street East, Savannah, Georgia 31401
(``Operating Companies''), have filed an application-declaration under sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), 12(c),
13(b), 32 and 33 of the Act and Rules 43, 45, 46, 53, 54, 86, 87, 90 and 91 thereunder. 

 By Commission order dated October 20, 1987 (HCAR No. 24476) (``1987 Order''), SEI was authorized to engage in the design,
development, construction, ownership and operation of cogeneration and independent power facilities within and
outside the United States. SEI also provides technical services to industrial and commercial concerns, unaffiliated
utilities and foreign governments in both domestic and international markets, and markets intellectual property
acquired or created by Southern system companies to unaffiliated third parties in accordance with Commission orders
dated July 17, 1981 and December 18, 1981 (HCAR Nos. 22132 and 22315A) (``Original Orders'').
 

 



As a part of a plan to reorganize various non-utility businesses of Southern and its subsidiaries along functional
lines, Southern and SEI propose in this application-declaration to amend and restate SEI's existing financing and
operational authority, SEI, SCS and the Operating Companies also propose to enter into intrasystem service agreements
pursuant to which such companies may render services and sell goods to ``exempt wholesale generators,'' or ``EWGs,''
as defined in Section 32 of the Act, and ``foreign utility companies,'' or ``FUCOs,'' as defined in Section 33, as well
as to associate companies that own qualifying facilities (``QFs'') as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978, as amended (``PURPA''), or other facilities that SEI may hereafter be authorized to acquire.


 Southern and SEI have adopted a plan of reorganization pursuant to which SEI proposes to organize and acquire all of
the stock of a newly organized Delaware corporation (``Newco'') in exchange for certain assets of SEI consisting
primarily of rights under certain existing consulting agreements with third parties and accounts receivable associated
therewith, which will be assigned to Newco; computers; office equipment and furniture; and interests in certain
software programs and other proprietary technology. Newco will also assume certain liabilities of SEI including
accounts payable, accrued pension and retirement costs associated with employees to be transferred to Newco, and
certain loss reserves under existing contracts. Immediately thereafter, the shares of Newco will be distributed
to Southern as a dividend distribution, and Newco and Development will be merged pursuant to a plan adopted under applicable
state law. 

 SEI and Southern propose to relinquish the authority granted by the Commission in the Original Orders and the 1987
Order upon the effective date of the Commission's order relating to this application-declaration and to the application
of Southern and Development, except with respect to any contracts and investments that are entered into or made by
SEI prior to the effective date of such orders in reliance upon and in accordance with the Original Orders or the 1987
Order.

SEI proposes to continue to engage in preliminary project development activities (``Development Activities'')
relating to the potential acquisition and ownership of independent power facilities, including QFs and facilities
to be owned or operated by EWGs and FUCOs, and other power production facilities located within the service territories
of the Operating Companies or the service territories of other members of the Southeastern Electric Reliability
Council, together with facilities and equipment that are ancillary to the foregoing, such as may be used for fuel production,
conversion, handling and/or storage; electrical transmission; and energy management, recovery and efficiency
(hereinafter referred to collectively as ``Projects''). With the exception noted below, in any case in which SEI's
Development Activities culminate in a proposal to acquire the securities of or other interest in any EWG or EUCO, it
is intended that Southern, rather than SEI, would consummate the acquisition in an exempt transaction pursuant to
section 32 or 33 of the Act, as applicable, subject to complying with all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Any acquisition by Southern or SEI of an interest in any other type of Project, and any related financing, would be the
subject of separate filings with this Commission.
SEI requests authority to acquire the stock of and provide needed working capital to one or more foreign subsidiaries
through which SEI would conduct its project Development Activities. SEI represents that in no case will any such subsidiary,
directly or indirectly, acquire, own or operate any significant assets or facilities, other than a bank account,
leased office space and related office equipment, issue or acquire any securities, other than common shares issued
to SEI, or provide services or sell goods to any associate company. The sole function of any such subsidiary would be
to engage in Development Activities on behalf of SEI in a foreign country or countries whose laws would subject SEI
to significant restrictions or penalties if SEI were itself to maintain a legal presence in any such country. The capitalization
of any such subsidiaries is expected to be less than $50,000.
SEI also proposes to render project development, engineering, design, construction and construction management,
operating, fuel management, maintenance and power plant overhaul, and other similar kinds of managerial and technical
services to both affiliated Project entities and to non-affiliated developers, operators and owners of independent
power projects and foreign and domestic utility systems. SEI proposes to render such services utilizing its own work
force, and personnel and other resources of SCS and the Operating Companies obtained pursuant to service agreements
(``Service Agreements'') as described below. SEI also proposes that in conjunction with providing services to non-affiliates,
it may enter into separate agreements to sell or license intellectual property it has created or acquired from non-affiliates
in connection with its authorized business activities.
All services rendered by SEI to non-affiliates will be based upon the fair market value thereof. SEI also proposes
to provide such services and sell goods to any Project entity that is an associate company (including but not limited
to any EWG, FUCO, or QF) at fair market prices, and requests an exemption pursuant to section 13(b) from the requirements
of rules 90 and 91 as applicable to such transactions in any case in which any one or more of the following circumstances
shall obtain:
1. Such Project entity derives no part of its income, directly or indirectly, from the generation, transmission,
or distribution of electric energy for sale within the United States;
2. Such Project entity is an EWG which sells electricity at market-based rates which have been approved by FERC or the
appropriate state public utility commission, or a QF which sells electricity at the purchaser's ``avoided cost''
determined in accordance with the regulations under PURPA, or sells electricity at rates negotiated at arms'-length
with large industrial or commercial customers purchasing such electricity for their own use and not for resale;
3. Such Project entity sells electricity at rates based upon its cost of service, as approved by FERC or any state public
utility commission having jurisdiction, provided that: (i) the purchaser of such electricity is not an associate
company of SEI within the Southern system, and (ii) the terms and conditions (including price) of the contract pursuant
to which SEI agrees to provide such services or goods have been expressly approved by the holders of a majority of the
equity interests of such Project entity other than Southern or any associate company of Southern.
SEI owns the exclusive rights to a proprietary computer-based remote generator dispatch and control program, known
as ``Standby Capacity Network'' (``SCN''). The SCN program enables a utility company remotely to access the capacity
associated with stand-by or emergency generators owned by its large customers, such as hospitals, factories, and
office buildings and operate the generators in parallel with its own grid. An SCN program could be implemented pursuant
to a contract between a utility and SEI under which SEI would agree to install certain equipment (primarily controls)
incorporating its proprietary software program and interconnection equipment and to act as the utility's agent
in operating, maintaining and fueling the customer's standby generator. Under such an arrangement, SEI would be
compensated by the utility. SEI would not seek to acquire any interest in the customer's generating equipment, and
would not take title to the electricity generated. SEI would retain all right, title and interest to the proprietary
software used in SCN.

SEI proposes to market the SCN program to both affiliated and unaffiliated utilities and/or their respective customers.
The program and related services would be sold to unaffiliated parties at prices to be negotiated based upon the fair
market value thereof. As currently required under the terms of the Original Orders, SEI will make the proprietary
technology incorporated into the SCN program available to the Operating Companies without charge (except for the
actual expenses incurred by SEI in making such program available). If an Operating Company requests SEI to provide
any related service, e.g., software support, training of Operating Company personnel, maintenance of the customer's
equipment, or the like, SEI would be the associate company for the costs of such services, determined in accordance
with rules 90 and 91.

Under the Original Orders, SEI has entered into Service Agreements with SCS and each of the Operating Companies (other
than Savannah, which was not then a subsidiary of Southern) pursuant to which personnel and other resources of SCS
and the Operating Companies may be made available to SEI, upon request, to support SEI in connection with its authorized
activities. Under these agreements, SEI is obligated to reimburse SCS or an Operating Company, as the case may be,
for the cost of such services, determined in accordance with Rules 9 and 91. The cost of services provided by an Operating
Company to SEI includes all direct charges and certain indirect costs, such as pension costs, insurance, payroll
taxes, and payments to employee benefits plans, and a portion of the administrative and general expenses of the Operating
Company.

The existing Service Agreements also obligate SEI to make any new intellectual or proprietary property, processes,
programs, computer or other data bases, support services, training and other facilities and techniques developed
in the course of SEI's business available for utilization by other Southern system companies without charge, except
for the actual expenses incurred in making the same available, to the extent that SEI has or retains proprietary rights
therein. Under the Service Agreements, SEI has a reciprocal right to receive such intellectual property from SCS
and the Operating Companies without charge, except for the actual expenses incurred in making the same available.

SCS and the Operating Companies propose to continue to render services and provide other resources to SEI in connection
with SEI's authorized activities in accordance with the existing Service Agreements, as amended, to reflect the
changes to SEI's authorized business activities and to comply with the Commission's rules relating to the rendering
of services or sale of goods directly by SEI or indirectly by the Operating Companies and SCS to EWGs and FUCOs in which
Southern holds an interest.

SCS and the Operating Companies will not, without requesting the further approval of the Commission, render any services
or sell any goods directly or indirectly to any EWG or FUCO in which Southern holds an interest, except pursuant to the
Service Agreements, as herein proposed to be amended.

Southern proposes to invest in SEI up to an aggregate of $250,000,000 from time to time through December 31, 1998, in
addition to any investments in SEI that Southern shall have made pursuant to previous authorizations, including
but not limited to the 1987 Order, prior to the effective date of the order in this proceeding. It is proposed that such
additional investments may take the form of any combination of cash capital contributions to SEI, loans to SEI by Southern,
and loans to SEI by one or more lenders other than Southern that are guaranteed by Southern.

SEI proposes to issue promissory notes (``Notes'') from time to time through December 31, 1998 to Southern or to lenders
other than Southern which have been guaranteed by Southern, provided that the sum of the aggregate principal amount
of Notes at any time outstanding and Southern's additional investments in SEI shall not exceed $250 million. The Notes
would have maturities no later than December 31, 2003, and would bear interest at a rate of not more than 3% over the prime
rate at the bank to be designated by Southern in the case of Notes issued to lenders other than Southern, and a rate of
not more than the prime rate in the case of Notes issued to Southern. In connection with any sale of Notes to lenders other
than Southern, a commitment fee may be paid in an amount not greater than 1/2 of 1% of the principal amount of the Note.
It is anticipated that any such Notes may be guaranteed by Southern as to principal, premium, if any, and interest.
It is further proposed that the Notes issued to Southern may, at the option of Southern, be converted to capital contributions
to SEI through Southern's forgiveness of the debt (including any accrued interest) represented thereby.

Southern also proposes, from time to time, to guarantee or act as indemnitor of commercial sureties required to support
bid bonds and performance and other obligations (other than securities or other financial instruments) issued or
undertaken by SEI in connection with its authorized activities.

It is therefore proposed that Southern may (i) provide such guarantees of, and similar provisions and arrangements
concerning, the performance and undertaking of other obligations by SEI (or any subsidiary of SEI), or of any Project
entity (including but not limited to EWGs and FUCOs) in which Southern holds a direct or indirect interest, and of other
obligations relating to SEI's authorized activities, and (ii) provide such indemnifications of and with respect
to persons acting as surety on bonds or other obligations on behalf of such companies, in an aggregate amount outstanding
at any one time of $800,000,000 through December 31, 2003; provided, that any guarantees or indemnifications outstanding
at December 31, 2003 shall continue until expiration or termination in accordance with their terms; and provided
further that the aggregate amount of such authorized guarantees or indemnifications of sureties shall be reduced
dollar for dollar by any similar guarantees or indemnifications of sureties made or incurred by Southern pursuant
to authority requested in File No. 70-8173 in connection with the business activities of Development.

As a further limitation to the foregoing, Southern states that the aggregate maximum amount of its exposure at any
one time under all performance guarantees or indemnification or similar arrangements entered into on behalf of subsidiary
companies that are EWGs or FUCOs shall not exceed $250,000,000, and that such amount shall be treated as part of Southern's
``aggregate investment'' in all such entities for purposes of rule 53(a). Southern proposes to negotiate specific
guarantees and similar provisions and arrangements with third parties, and indemnifications of sureties, as the
need to do so arises, without further Commission authorization.

(Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation). 




Supplementary Information: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 



Applicant's Representations 



1. Applicant, an open-end non-diversified management investment company, is organized as a business trust under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On July 19, 1989, applicant filed a notification of registration on
Form N-8A under section 8(a) of the Act, and a registration statement on Form N-1A under section 8(b) of
the Act and the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on September 15, 1989, and the
public offering of applicant's shares commenced on that date. 

2. At a meeting held on February 27, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved agreements and plans of reorganization
providing for the transfer of all of the assets of applicant's two series to two other investment companies. These
agreements provided for the transfer of all of the assets of (1) Templeton Insured Tax Free Fund (``Templeton Insured'')
to Franklin Insured Tax-Free Income Fund (``Franklin Insured''), a series of Franklin Tax-Free Trust, in exchange
for shares of Franklin Insured, and (2) Templeton Tax Free Money Fund (``Templeton Money'') to Franklin Tax-Exempt
Money Fund (``Franklin Money'') in exchange for shares of Franklin Money. 

3. The trustees determined that the proposed reorganizations were in the best interests of the shareholders of each
series because they would permit shareholders to pursue their investment goals in larger funds, which would have
enhanced ability to effect portfolio transactions on more favorable terms and should have greater investment flexibility.
The trustees also decided that the reorganizations would enable shareholders to obtain the benefits of economies
of scale. 
4. Templeton Global Bond Managers (``Templeton Global''), a division of Templeton Investment Counsel, Inc. (``TICI''),
is the investment adviser for Templeton Insured and Templeton Money. Franklin Advisers, Inc. is the investment adviser
for Franklin Insured and Franklin Money. TICI and Franklin Advisers, Inc. are wholly owned subsidiaries of Franklin
Resources, Inc. Accordingly, Templeton Insured and Franklin Insured, and Templeton Money and Franklin Money, may
be deemed to be affiliated persons by reason of being under the control of investment advisers that are themselves
under common control. Applicant therefore relied on the exemption provided by rule 17a-8 under the Act to effect
the transaction.
 Consequently, the trustees determined, in accordance with rule 17a-8, that the purchase of the assets of the
two series by Franklin Insured and Franklin Money was in the best interests of the shareholders of the series, and that
such purchases would not result in any dilution to the interests of the existing shareholders of the series.

5. A registration statement on Form N-14 was filed with the SEC on May 28, 1993, and the proxy statement/prospectus
contained therein was furnished to applicant's shareholders on or about July 15, 1993. The holders of a majority of
the outstanding voting shares of each of Templeton Insured and Templeton Money approved agreements and plans of reorganization
with Franklin Insured and Franklin Money, respectively, at a special meeting of shareholders held on August 27, 1993.


6. On August 27, 1993, there were 18,793,312 shares with a net asset value of $1 per share of Templeton Money. On that
date, Franklin Money acquired all of the assets of Templeton Money in exchange for shares of Franklin Money. The number
of full and fractional shares that were exchanged for the assets of Templeton Money was determined by dividing the
net asset value per share of Templeton Money as of that date by the net asset value per share of Franklin Money. The result
was then multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of Templeton Money. Immediately following the acquisition,
Templeton Money dissolved and distributed the shares of Franklin Money 

pro rata

 to its shareholders of record.


7. On August 27, 1993, there were 2,773,418 shares with a net asset value of $11.7566 per share of Templeton Insured,
which had aggregate net assets of $32,605,919. On that date, Templeton Insured distributed to its shareholders $.085
per share of net investment income and $.03 per share of net realized capital gains. Shortly thereafter, Franklin
Insured acquired all of the assets of Templeton Insured in exchange for shares of Franklin Insured. The number of full
and fractional shares of Franklin Insured that were exchanged for the assets of Templeton Insured was determined
by dividing the net asset value per share of Templeton Insured as of that date by the net asset value per share of Franklin
Insured. The result was then multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of Templeton Insured. Immediately following
the acquisition, Templeton Insured dissolved and distributed the shares of Franklin Insured 

pro rata

 to its shareholders of record.


8. The expenses attributable to the acquisition of Templeton Insured by Franklin Insured, including printing and
mailing costs for proxy statements and related documents, amounted to $12,565.77. Templeton Global, Franklin Advisers,
Inc., Templeton Insured, and Franklin Insured each paid one quarter of this amount. The expenses attributable to
the acquisition of Templeton Money by Franklin Money, including printing and mailing costs for proxy statements
and related documents, amounted to $16,860.82. Templeton Global, Franklin Advisers, Inc., Templeton Money, and
Franklin Money each paid one quarter of this amount.


9. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities, nor was it a party to any litigation
or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.


10. Applicant intends to file a certificate of dissolution in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Maryland Certification Requirements for Transporters of Oil or Controlled Hazardous Substances 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Administrative determination of Preemption by RSPA's Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials
Safety. 





APPLICANT: 

Chemical Waste Transportation Institute and National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. 



STATE LAWS AFFECTED: 

Code of Maryland Regulations 26.10.01.16.D and 26.13.04.01.F.

 

APPLICABLE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS: 

Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49 App. U.S.C. 1801 et seq., and the Hazardous Materials Regulations
(HMR), 49 CFR Parts 171-180.



MODE AFFECTED: 

Highway.


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Maryland regulations requiring certification of operators of motor vehicles loading or unloading oil or ``controlled
hazardous substances'' in Maryland are preempted by 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2) as they apply to operators of vehicles
transporting hazardous materials not domiciled in Maryland. These requirements are stricter than operator training
requirements promulgated under the HMTA, and therefore are obstacles to accomplishing the full purposes and objectives
of the HMTA. As applied to operators domiciled in Maryland, the requirements are not preempted.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Application for Preemption Determination 


On April 19, 1993, the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute (CWTI) and the National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc.
(NTTC) jointly applied for a determination of preemption pursuant to 49 CFR 107.203. The CWTI/NTTC application seeks
an administrative determination that the HMTA preempts State of Maryland certification requirements for operators
of vehicles loading or unloading oil or ``controlled hazardous substances'' in Maryland. 
On May 19, 1993, RSPA published a Public Notice and Invitation to Comment, providing for comments until June 23, 1993,
and rebuttal comments until August 29, 1993. 58 FR 29322. Eight transporters of oil, hazardous waste or hazardous
materials, one transporter association and one environmental services firm submitted comments supporting preemption
of one or both sets of certification requirements. The Maryland Department of the Environment, Waste Management
Administration (MDE), submitted comments opposing preemption of the requirements for operators of oil transport
vehicles, but took no position on the requirements for operators of controlled hazardous substance transport vehicles.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Hazardous Materials (MassDEP),
submitted comments opposing preemption in part. CWTI/NTTC submitted rebuttal comments responding to those of MDE
and MassDEP. 


A. Maryland Requirements for Operator Certification 


The two provisions of Maryland law for which CWTI/NTTC request a determination of preemption impose certification
requirements on operators of motor vehicles used to transport oil or ``controlled hazardous substances.''

1. Oil Transporter's Certificate 


The first certification requirement for which CWTI/NTTC seek a finding of preemption is Code of Maryland Regulations
(COMAR) 26.10.01.16.D. This regulation, issued pursuant to general statutory authority in Environment Article
 4-405, Annotated Code Maryland, prescribes that ``[a] vehicle used in the transport or transfer of oil
shall be operated by a driver possessing a valid Oil Vehicle Operator's Certificate'' issued by MDE. Read in conjunction
with COMAR 26.10.01.17.A, the requirement applies only to operators of oil cargo tank vehicles. Further, it applies
only to vehicles into which oil is loaded, or from which it is unloaded, in Maryland; it does not apply to operators of
vehicles that simply pass through the State. COMAR 26.10.01.17.B. The certificate is issued ``after the driver has
completed an examination and has obtained a passing grade indicating his knowledge of the procedures employed for
the safe handling of oil, oil spill control measures and oil spill reporting requirements.'' COMAR 26.10.01.17.A(2).
The operator must carry the certificate whenever engaged in the transfer or transport of oil. COMAR 26.10.01.17.A(4).

An operator must preregister for the examination, which is given at five in-state locations and at out-of-state business
locations as approved by MDE. There is no fee for the examination or the certificate. The certificate is valid for five
years. 


2. Controlled Hazardous Substance Transporter's Certificate 


The second certification requirement for which a finding of preemption is sought is COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(1). This
provision, enacted pursuant to Environment Article  7-252(b), Annotated Code of Maryland, states:




A person may not transport any CHS [controlled hazardous substance] from any source in the State or to any CHS facility
in the State unless a driver certificate has been issued for the vehicle driver.




A ``controlled hazardous substance'' (CHS) is 
(1) Any hazardous substance that [MDE] identifies as a controlled hazardous substance under th[e] subtitle; or 
(2) Low-level nuclear waste. 
Env't Article  7-201(b), Ann. Code Md. The term includes all materials designated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 40 U.S.C.   6901
et seq. Env't Article  7-201(m)(2). Although the definition of CHS is broader, CWTI/NTTC states, and
MDE does not contest, that Maryland applies the certification requirement only to transporters of RCRA hazardous
waste. See also COMAR 26.13.04.01.A(1) (``These regulations establish standards which apply to persons transporting
hazardous waste within the State.''). 
The certificate is issued on evidence of ``satisfactory completion of an approved training program,'' COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(3)(c),
which must cover:



(a) Training in the requirements necessary to transport hazardous waste. Emphasis should be placed on the ability
to verify proper DOT shipping names, hazard class and EPA waste codes. Special attention should be directed to the
Maryland Hazardous Waste Manifest, other state manifest requirements, and the proper disbursement of manifest
copies. 

(b) Training in the required labeling and marking of all containers of 110 gallons or less. 
(c) Training in Placarding. All drivers of vehicles transporting hazardous waste shall be able to appropriately
placard their truck according to the DOT regulations under COMAR 11.16.01 (49 CFR 172 Subpart F). 
(d) Training in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration [sic] regulations including proper maintenance
of a driver's daily log. 
(e) Training in emergency procedures to follow in case of an accident or spill. 
(f) Training in Maryland's hazardous waste regulations and law. 



COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(4). The regulations further stipulate that a training program instructor must successfully
have completed an approved instruction training program or must have five years of experience in the trucking industry,
with at least two years of involvement in safe driving activities or training. COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(5). MDE may require
from an operator ``satisfactory completion of an approved written examination.'' COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(6). 
The certificate must be carried in the vehicle during transportation of CHS. COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(3)(b). It is valid
for three years, subject to payment of an annual $20 fee. COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(2),(3)(a).

B. Hazardous Materials To Which Maryland Requirements Apply 


As summarized above, the Maryland certification requirements apply to operators of motor vehicles transporting
hazardous waste and cargo tank vehicles transporting oil when those vehicles are loaded or unloaded within the State
of Maryland. 
An oil is a hazardous material subject to the HMTA and HMR if it meets the criteria of any HMR hazard class. Most oils that
are designated as hazardous materials are designated because they meet criteria for flammability, 49 CFR 173.120(a),
or combustibility, 49 CFR 173.120(b). If an oil is not flammable or combustible, does not meet the criteria for any
other hazard class, and is not among a small number of individually specified hazardous materials, 49 CFR 172.101(b)(1),
it is not a designated hazardous material. Numerous oils, such as lubricating and vegetable oils, are not ordinarily
designated hazardous materials. 
Accordingly, the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification requirement applies to the transport of both oils
that are hazardous materials and those that are not. Operator certification requirements for the transport of oils
that are not hazardous materials are not subject to preemption by the HMTA. This preemption determination pertains
to the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement only as it applies to the transport of oils that are hazardous
materials. 
In addition, the HMR do not apply to the highway transportation of oil by an intrastate carrier if that oil is not a hazardous
waste, hazardous substance, flammable cryogenic liquid or marine pollutant. 49 CFR 171.1(a)(3); but see 58 FR 36920
(July 9, 1993), correction at 58 FR 38111 (July 15, 1993)(notice of rulemaking proposing to extend the HMR to intrastate
highway carriage). Accordingly, this preemption determination does not apply to the transportation by intrastate
highway carriers of oil not in the categories enumerated in 49 CFR 171.1(a)(3). 
The Maryland statute under which the CHS vehicle operator certification requirement is enacted defines CHS broadly,
to include RCRA hazardous waste, low-level nuclear waste and any other substance determined by MDE to be injurious
to plant, animal or aquatic life. Env't Article  7-201(b), Ann. Code Md. As noted above, however, the certification
requirement is applied only to operators of vehicles transporting RCRA hazardous waste. Thus, hereafter, the CHS
vehicle certification requirement will be referred to as the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement.

RCRA hazardous waste, as designated pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6921 by the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), is a hazardous material under the HMR. 49 CFR 171.8 (``Hazardous material'') (as amended at 55 FR 52930,
52935 (Nov. 5, 1992)); see also 49 CFR 171.3(a) (``No person may offer for transportation or transport a hazardous
waste * * * in interstate or intrastate commerce except in accordance with the requirements of [the
HMR].''). Both interstate and intrastate hazardous waste transporters are subject to the HMR. 49 CFR 171.1(a). 
In the preemption analysis that follows, the Maryland certification requirements are compared to HMTA requirements
under the ``dual compliance'' and ``obstacle'' tests of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). See Section II, below. For purposes
of the dual compliance test, the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement is considered as written.
The obstacle test, however, looks at the requirement ``as applied or enforced.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2). Therefore,
under this test, the requirement is considered only as it is applied to the transportation of RCRA hazardous waste.



C. HMTA Training and Certification Requirements for Motor Vehicle Operators 


General training requirements for persons packaging, offering or transporting hazardous materials are found in
the HMR at 49 CFR 172.700-.704. These requirements apply to ``hazmat employees,'' which term includes, among others,
those who ``[o]perate[] a vehicle used to transport hazardous materials.'' 49 CFR 172.702(b), 171.8 (``Hazmat employee'').
Each ``hazmat employee'' must receive, at least every two years, three types of training: (1) Training to provide
general familiarity with the HMR and a general ability to recognize and identify hazardous materials consistent
with HMR standards; (2) training specific to the hazardous material functions the employee performs; and (3) training
in workplace safety and emergency response. 49 CFR 172.704(a). Required training is not further specified; instead,
the regulations contemplate that hazmat employees will be trained in a manner best suited to the hazardous materials
transportation functions they perform. See 57 FR 20944, 20949 (May 15, 1992)(preamble to final rule enacting 49 CFR
172.700-.704). 
In addition, operators of motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials must be trained in accordance with modal-specific
requirements of 49 CFR 177.816. Training subjects include vehicle inspection and operation; requirements pertaining
to attendance, parking, smoking, routing and incident reporting; and loading and unloading. 49 CFR 177.816(a).
Cargo tank operators must receive specialized training in tank emergency control features, special vehicle handling
characteristics, tank loading and unloading, properties and hazards of materials transported, and tank retest
and inspection requirements. 49 CFR 177.816(b). Under section 177.816, operators must be trained in applicable
requirements of parts 383, 387 and 390 through 399 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR), 49 CFR
parts 350-399. 
Part 383 specifies requirements for obtaining a Commercial Driver's License (CDL), including requirements for
the tank vehicle endorsement, 49 CFR 383.119, and the hazardous materials endorsement, 49 CFR 383.121. Section 177.816(c)
provides that the training requirements of sections 177.816(a) and (b) may be satisfied by compliance with the CDL
requirements for the tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement. Sections 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1 together
require operator training in all aspects of the FMCSR. They are incorporated into the HMR as well by 49 CFR 177.804,
as they apply to interstate operators of motor vehicles transporting hazardous materials. 
Both 49 CFR 172.704(d) and 49 CFR 177.816 require that training documentation be retained; 49 CFR 172.702(d) requires
that an employer test its employees. No provision of the HMR, however, requires that evidence of training be submitted
to, or that operators be tested or certified by, a governmental body. A vehicle operator may comply with 49 CFR 177.816
by passing an examination and obtaining the CDL with a tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement. 49 CFR 177.816(c)(1).

Nonetheless, this is an alternative means of complying with the regulation, and is not required. 


II. Preemption Under the HMTA 


The HMTA was enacted in 1975 to give the Department of Transportation greater authority ``to protect the Nation adequately
against the risks to life and property which are inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce.''
49 App. U.S.C. 1801. It ``replace[d] a patchwork of state and federal laws and regulations concerning hazardous materials
with a scheme of uniform, national regulations.'' 

Southern Pac. Transp. Co. 

v. 

Public Serv. Comm'n, 

909 F.2d 352, 353 (9th Cir. 1990). 
As enacted in 1975, the HMTA preempted ``any requirement, of a State or political subdivision thereof, which is inconsistent
with any requirement set forth in [the HMTA], or in a regulation issued under [the HMTA].'' HMTA, Pub. L. 93-633,
 112(a), 88 Stat. 2161 (1975). Congress intended this provision ``to preclude a multiplicity of State regulations
and the potential for varying as well as conflicting regulations in the area of hazardous materials transportation.''
S. Rep. No. 1192, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 37 (1974). 
Thereafter, DOT's Materials Transportation Bureau (MTB), predecessor of RSPA's Office of Hazardous Materials
Safety, implemented HMTA preemption through the issuance of inconsistency rulings. Inconsistency rulings, while
advisory in nature, were ``an alternative to litigation for a determination of the relationship of Federal and State
or local requirements'' and also a possible ``basis for an application [for] a waiver of preemption pursuant to section
112(b) of the HMTA.'' Inconsistency Ruling No. 2 (IR-2), 44 FR 75566, 76657 (Dec. 20, 1979). 
In the 1990 amendments to the HMTA, Pub. L. 101-615 (Nov. 16, 1990), preemption under the HMTA was strengthened
on the basis of the following Congressional findings: 




(3) many States and localities have enacted laws and regulations which vary from Federal laws and regulations pertaining
to the transportation of hazardous materials, thereby creating the potential for unreasonable hazards in other
jurisdictions and confounding shippers and carriers which attempt to comply with multiple and conflicting registration,
permitting, routing, notification, and other regulatory requirements, 
(4) because of the potential risks to life, property, and the environment posed by unintentional releases of hazardous
materials, consistency in laws and regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials is necessary
and desirable, 
(5) in order to achieve greater uniformity and to promote the public health, welfare, and safety at all levels, Federal
standards for regulating the transportation of hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce
are necessary and desirable. 




49 App. U.S.C. 1801 note. In amending the HMTA, Congress affirmed that ``uniformity was the linchpin'' of the statute.
Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d 1571, 1575 (10th Cir. 1991). Unless a waiver of preemption is granted
by DOT, the HMTA as amended explicitly preempts ``any requirement of a State or political subdivision thereof or Indian
tribe'' not ``otherwise authorized by Federal law'' if 




(1) Compliance with both the State or political subdivision or Indian tribe requirement and any requirement of [the
HMTA] or of any regulation issued under [the HMTA] is not possible, 
(2) The State or political subdivision or Indian tribe requirement as applied or enforced creates an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of [the HMTA] or the regulations issued under [the HMTA], or 
(3) It is preempted under section 105(a)(4) [49 App. U.S.C.  1804(a)(4), concerning ``covered subjects'']
or section 105(b) [49 U.S.C.  1804(b), concerning highway routing requirements]. 




49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). 


The first two paragraphs codify the ``dual compliance'' and ``obstacle'' criteria that RSPA had applied in issuing
inconsistency rulings prior to the 1990 amendments to the HMTA. These criteria derive from U.S. Supreme Court preemption
decisions. 

E.g., Ray 

v. 

Atlantic Richfield, Inc., 

435 U.S. 151 (1978); 

Florida Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. 

v. 

Paul, 

373 U.S. 132 (1963); 

Hines 

v. 

Davidowitz, 

312 U.S. 52 (1941). 
The third paragraph, 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(3), in conjunction with 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4), specifies five ``covered
subject'' areas in which non-Federal requirements are given particular scrutiny: 




(i) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous materials. 
(ii) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of hazardous materials.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00142 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents pertaining to hazardous materials and requirements
respecting the number, content, and placement of such documents. 
(iv) The written notification, recording, and reporting of the unintentional release in transportation of hazardous
materials. 
(v) The design, manufacturing, fabrication, marking, maintenance, reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a
package or container which is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation
of hazardous materials.




In these areas, a non-Federal requirement that is ``not otherwise authorized by Federal law'' is preempted unless
it is ``substantively the same'' as the HMTA or HMR requirement. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). To be ``substantively the
same,'' the non-Federal requirement must ``conform[] in every significant respect to the Federal requirement.
Editorial and other similar de minimis changes are permitted.'' 49 CFR 107.202(d). 
A more limited preemption test, independent of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a), applies when the non-Federal requirement
is being compared to FMCSR provisions incorporated into the HMR through 49 CFR 177.804. RSPA has declared that in enacting
49 CFR 177.804, it did not intend to change the preemptive effect of those FMCSR provisions incorporated. See IR-22,
52 FR 46574 (Dec. 8, 1987). The preemptive effect of FMCSR training requirements, 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1, is
set forth at 49 CFR 390.9:



Except as otherwise specifically indicated, subchapter B of this chapter [49 CFR Parts 350-399] is not intended
to preclude States or subdivisions thereof from establishing or enforcing State or local laws relating to safety,
the compliance with which would not prevent full compliance with these regulations by the person subject thereto.

 

This standard essentially is the ``dual compliance'' standard. See IR-32, 55 FR 36736, 36741 (Sept. 6, 1990).
Any FMSCR provision incorporated into the HMR solely through 49 CFR 177.804 therefore preempts a State or local requirement
``only if compliance with both is impossible.'' IR-32, 55 FR at 36741. 
In place of the prior process for issuing advisory inconsistency rulings, the HMTA authorizes any directly affected
person to apply to the Secretary of Transportation for a preemption determination with respect to a requirement of
a State, political subdivision or Indian tribe. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(c)(1). Preemption determinations under authority
of the HMTA address preemption only by the HMTA, and not by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution or federal statutes
other than the HMTA. Other statutes may be relevant to determining HMTA preemption, for instance in establishing
whether a non-Federal requirement is ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(A). 
The Secretary of Transportation has delegated to RSPA the authority to make preemption determinations, except for
those concerning highway routing, which are delegated to the Federal Highway Administration. 49 CFR 1.53(b). Under
RSPA's regulations, preemption determinations are issued by RSPA's Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials
Safety. 49 CFR 107.209(a). If the HMTA preempts a requirement of a State, a political subdivision of a State or an Indian
tribe, that jurisdiction may apply for a waiver of preemption under 49 CFR 107.215 through 107.227. A waiver may be
granted if the Associate Administrator finds that the non-Federal requirement affords the public a level of safety
equal to or greater than that afforded by the HMR, and that it does not unreasonably burden commerce. Alternatively,
the jurisdiction may petition under 49 CFR 106.31 for adoption of a uniform Federal rule. 
Preemption determinations under the HMTA are consistent with the principles and policy set forth in Executive Order
No. 12,612 (``Federalism''), 52 FR 41685 (Oct. 30, 1987). Section 4(a) of that Executive Order authorizes preemption
of State laws only when a statute contains an express preemption provision, there is other clear evidence of Congressional
intent to preempt, or the exercise of State authority directly conflicts with the exercise of Federal authority.
The HMTA contains an express preemption provision, implemented through RSPA regulations. 


III. The CWTI/NTTC Application and Public Comment 


A. The CWTI/NTTC Application 


The CWTI/NTTC application asserts that the Maryland driver certification requirements duplicate and conflict
with Federal standards. It observes that 49 CFR Part 383 of the FMCSR requires a driver to have a CDL with a cargo tank
endorsement when operating a cargo tank, and a CDL with a hazardous materials endorsement when transporting hazardous
materials. It notes that the HMR do not impose training certification requirements beyond the employer's duty, set
forth at 49 CFR 172.704(d)(5), to maintain training records.

Citing 49 CFR 172.701, CWTI/NTTC object to the requirement that operators not domiciled in Maryland be certified.
This regulation authorizes a State to impose training requirements more strict than HMR requirements only on motor
vehicle operators domiciled in that State. They refer to the preamble to the final rule enacting 49 CFR 172.700-.704,
57 FR 20944, 20947 (May 15, 1992), which states that 49 CFR 172.701 reflects RSPA's recognition of the ``traditional
regulation by States of their own resident drivers * * * through drivers' licensing
requirements and procedures.'' CWTI/NTTC appear to argue that RSPA intended to preserve State authority to regulate
its own drivers only when that authority is exercised by the State agency traditionally responsible for driver licensing.
If section 172.701 is read in this way, CWTI/NTTC imply, it would authorize regulation only by the Maryland Motor Vehicle
Administration, the agency that issues the CDL, and not by MDE. 
The CWTI/NTTC application maintains that the Maryland requirements violate both the ``dual compliance'' test and
the ``obstacle'' test under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). The ``dual compliance'' test, CWTI/NTTC assert, is violated
in two respects:

 

1. A driver cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements and 49 CFR 383.21(a), which prohibits a commercial motor
vehicle operator from having more than one driver's license at any time. 
2. A non-domiciled driver cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements and 49 CFR 172.701(b), which prohibits
the application of State training requirements stricter than those of the HMR to non-domiciled drivers.



According to CWTI/NTTC, the Maryland requirements also are ``obstacles'' to accomplishing the purposes of the HMR
because transporters' burden of complying with paperwork and training requirements of a potentially large number
of States, particularly burdens of pre-registering for and attending State-administered tests, would be significant.
CWTI/NTTC also suggest that the certification requirements for hazardous waste transporters should be reviewed
under 49 CFR 171.3(c), which strictly limits the ability of States to regulate hazardous waste differently than do
the HMR. 

Finally, CWTI/NTTC assert that the Maryland requirements are not ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' See 49
App. U.S.C. 1811(a). 


B. Comments Supporting Preemption 


RSPA has received comments supporting preemption of one or both operator certification requirements from ten additional
parties, including one oil transporter, one hazardous materials transporter, six hazardous waste transporters,
an environmental services firm and the Hazardous Materials Advisory Council (HMAC), an association representing
the hazardous materials transportation industry. 
With respect to Maryland's oil cargo tank operator certification, COMAR 26.10.01.16.D, Amoco Oil Company, Nortru,
Inc., Heritage Transport, Inc. and Laidlaw Environmental Services Inc. share the view of CWTI/NTTC that the Maryland
requirements duplicate the HMR and the CDL hazardous materials endorsement. Nortru asks how changes in Federal requirements
would be incorporated into the substantive requirements of Maryland's certification process. Amoco, Nortru and
Heritage Transport emphasize the administrative burden that could result from a determination that Maryland's
certification requirements were not preempted. They assert that these burdens, multiplied by the number of States
imposing separate requirements, would include paperwork burdens, the difficulty of maintaining a current knowledge
of changing State requirements, and lost business opportunities and delays from failing to obtain certifications
before entering Maryland. Nortru and HMAC join CWTI/NTTC in citing 49 CFR 172.701(a), which allows a State to impose
training requirements more strict than those of the HMR only on drivers domiciled in that State. 
Regarding Maryland's hazardous waste vehicle operator certification, COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, commenters' arguments
mirror those for the oil cargo tank operator certification. Nortru, Environmental Transport, Inc., McCutcheon
Enterprises, Inc., Dart Trucking Company, Inc., Heritage Transport, Laidlaw and Custom Environmental Transport,
Inc. charge that the certification duplicates the HMR and the CDL hazardous materials endorsement. Nortru, Environmental
Transport and Custom Environmental Transport assert that the certification requirement fails to address how changes
in Federal requirements will affect the validity of existing certificates, or how such changes are to be incorporated
into revised training programs. Nortru, Environmental Transport, McCutcheon, Heritage Transport, Custom Environmental
Transport and Eldredge, Inc. claim administrative burdens similar to those claimed for the oil cargo tank operator
certification. Nortru and HMAC, again, point to the 49 CFR 172.701(a) prohibition on imposing requirements stricter
than the HMR on non-domiciled drivers. HMAC argues that this conflict results in a violation of the dual compliance
test. Eldredge and Dart Trucking, concurring with CWTI/NTTC, assert that the 49 CFR 383.21 prohibition against multiple
licenses makes dual compliance impossible. 


C. Comments Opposing Preemption 


MDE has filed comments opposing preemption of the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement. It takes no
position on preemption of the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement.

MDE does not agree that the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement violates the 49 CFR 383.21 prohibition
against multiple licenses. It maintains that the driver's certification is directed to ensuring not the safe transport
of oil, but its safe transfer, and that the certificate is not a driver's license within the meaning of 49 CFR 383.21.
It argues that the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification program is consistent with the training scheme
of 49 CFR 172.700-.704, which sets a performance standard but does not stipulate specific training elements. In particular,
it points to 49 CFR 172.702(c), which encourages training by ``public sources.'' In addition, it notes correctly
that the CDL hazardous materials endorsement is required only for the transport of placarded shipments, and that
not all oil movements require placards. (For example, oil that is a hazardous waste, but that does not meet the criteria
for any other hazard class, is a Class 9 hazardous material not required to be placarded. 49 CFR 172.504(f)(9).) Transportation
of non-placarded oil therefore does not require a hazmat endorsement and accordingly, MDE concludes, there is no
duplication of CDL requirements. 
Finally, MDE argues that the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is ``otherwise authorized by Federal
law,'' and thus protected from preemption under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). It finds this authority under sections 102
and 104 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA), 33 U.S.C. 1252(a) and 1254(a)(1). According to MDE, these
sections empower States to institute training requirements directed to preventing and reducing water pollution.
MDE also states that EPA approved Maryland's underground storage tank program under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle I, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq., in part on the basis of the existence of the certification requirement.

MassDEP asserts that a State's ability to require documentation of driver training is fundamental to effectively
regulating hazardous waste transporters. It also refers to ongoing proceedings under 49 App. U.S.C. 1819, under
which a working group, formed in part of State representatives, has recommended uniform forms and procedures for
State registration and permitting of hazardous materials transporters. The recommendations have been transmitted
to the Secretary of Transportation, and may form the basis for Department of Transportation regulations. MassDEP
suggests that a determination that the Maryland requirement to document training is preempted would undermine both
State regulatory efforts and the working group process. It requests that preemption be considered only to the extent
that Maryland requires non-domiciled operators to come into the State for certification. 


D. Rebuttal Comments 


In rebuttal, CWTI/NTTC reiterate their contention that the Maryland requirements violate both the 49 CFR 172.701(a)
prohibition on the application of stricter State training requirements to non-domiciled drivers and the ``one driver/one
license'' rule of 49 CFR 383.21(a). They concur with Nortru, Environmental Transport Group and Custom Environmental
Transport that delays inherent in the certification process will cause lost business opportunities. 


IV. Discussion 


The Maryland regulations under examination concern driver training and certification, and maintenance of training
records. None of these is a ``covered subject'' listed in 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(B). Accordingly, the ``substantively
the same'' preemption standard of 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(A) and 1811(a)(3) does not apply. Rather, the Maryland
regulations are preempted if: 



(1) compliance with both the State * * * requirement and any requirement of [the HMTA or the HMR] is not
possible




[or]


 

(2) the State * * * requirement as applied or enforced creates an obstacle to the accomplishment and
execution of [the HMTA or the HMR]. 




49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). Both standards, the ``dual compliance'' and the ``obstacle'' standard, are employed to determine
the preemptive effect of 49 CFR 172.700-.704 and 177.816. In considering the preemptive effect of 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2)
and 392.1, however, only the dual compliance test applies. As discussed in section II, above, these provisions, due
to their incorporation into the HMR through 49 CFR 177.804, have a narrower preemptive effect than do other HMR provisions.



A. The ``Dual Compliance'' Test 


HMR training requirements for motor vehicle operators appear at 49 CFR 172.700-.704 and 177.816 and, through incorporation,
at 49 CFR 390.3(e)(2) and 392.1. Each of these requirements specifies training in aspects of motor vehicle operation
when hazardous materials are being transported. Sections 172.702(d), 172.704 and 177.816 require that operators
be tested and records of training be maintained. To the extent that the Maryland regulations impose training requirements
different from those of the HMR, they are additive. Neither CWTI/NTTC nor any other commenter has suggested that an
operator cannot comply with both HMR training requirements and the applicable Maryland certification requirements.

CWTI/NTTC and other commenters do assert, however, that transporters cannot comply with both the Maryland requirements
and certain other HMR provisions, namely 49 CFR 172.701 and 383.21(a). The arguments advanced, however, are not persuasive.

Section 172.701 prohibits States from imposing on non-domiciled operators training requirements stricter than
those of the HMR. The fact that the regulation is a prohibition on what a State may do means that it cannot create a dual
compliance problem for an operator. The dual compliance standard ensures that the regulated community is not put
in the position where a non-Federal jurisdiction commands it to do an act that the HMR forbid, or, conversely, where
the HMR require an act that the non-Federal jurisdiction forbids. For example, a transporter could not comply with
a State requirement to placard a vehicle not carrying hazardous materials without violating 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(e)(2)
and 49 CFR 171.2(f)(2), which prohibit representing that a hazardous material is present in a motor vehicle when it
is not. See also 49 CFR 171.502(a). Because 49 CFR 172.701 is addressed solely to the State as a regulator, it imposes
no duty on an operator, and an operator could not be found in violation of it. As discussed below, 49 CFR 172.701 is relevant
to whether the Maryland requirements are an ``obstacle'' to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA. It does not, however,
present a dual compliance problem.

Section 383.21(a) provides that no operator of a commercial motor vehicle ``shall at any time have more than one driver's
license.'' Whether compliance with both this regulation and the Maryland certification requirement is impossible
hinges on whether the Maryland operator's certificate is a ``driver's license'' within the meaning of the regulation.
The short answer to the claim, however, is that it is not within the scope of HMTA preemption. Part 383, unlike Parts
390 through 397 of the FMCSR, is not incorporated into the HMR. See 49 CFR 177.804. Accordingly, Part 383 is not a regulation
``issued under'' the HMTA within the meaning of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(1), and cannot be the basis for a determination
of preemption under the statute. 


B. The ``Obstacle'' Test 


While neither operator certification requirement fails the dual compliance test, either requirement nevertheless
is preempted if it ``stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives''
of the HMTA. Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d at 1580. The ``full purposes and objectives'' of the HMTA
are, foremost, furthering safe hazardous materials transportation and establishing a uniform system of regulation
that, by reducing confusion and promoting compliance, contributes to enhanced safety. 
As noted in section I.B, above, we consider the oil cargo tank operator certification requirement only as it applies
to transportation of oil that is a hazardous material under the HMTA. The HMTA does not preempt Maryland's application
of the regulation to the transportation of oil that is not a designated hazardous material. In addition, in determining
whether the certification requirements are an ``obstacle,'' we consider them ``as enforced and applied.'' 49 App.
U.S.C. 1811(a)(2). Therefore, we consider the hazardous waste vehicle operator certification requirement with
respect to the transportation of RCRA-designated hazardous waste only. See section I.B, above. 
When a non-Federal requirement differs from the HMR, RSPA must determine whether that difference is an obstacle to
the statutory purposes and objectives. The degree to which a requirement may differ from the HMR before it becomes
an obstacle depends on the subject matter of the requirement. With respect to certain areas identified in the HMTA,
namely, the ``covered subjects'' of 49 App. U.S.C. 1804(a)(4)(B), uniformity is paramount and no material deviation
is permitted. 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). In other areas, RSPA must determine the necessary degree of uniformity in light
of existing statutory and regulatory language. 
In the area of training, the HMR already have established the extent to which States may regulate differently. Under
49 CFR 172.701, a State may impose training requirements more strict than those of the HMR only if those requirements:





(a) Do not conflict with the training requirements in [49 CFR part 172, Subpart H and part 177]; and 
(b) Apply only to drivers domiciled in that State. 




The authority granted to States to impose stricter requirements on their domiciled operators ``recognizes the traditional
regulation by States of their own resident drivers.'' 57 FR at 20947. It recognizes as well that were States permitted
to impose stricter requirements on non-resident operators, operators potentially would be subject to numerous
sets of training requirements, with resulting confusion, cost and paperwork burdens. The Federal regulation ``represents
an appropriate balancing of the interests of the States and the transportation industry.'' 57 FR at 20947. Cf. IR-26,
54 FR 16314, 16322 (Apr. 21, 1989)(considering preemption of State training requirements before promulgation of
49 CFR 172.701). 
The 49 CFR 172.701 limitation on State regulatory authority over non-domiciled operators pertains only to State
``training requirements.'' The term ``training,'' as defined at 49 CFR 172.700(b), means: 




A systematic program that ensures a hazmat employee has familiarity with the general provisions of [the HMR], is able
to recognize and identify hazardous materials, has knowledge of specific requirements of [the HMR] applicable to
functions performed by the employee, and has knowledge of emergency response information, self-protection measures
and accident prevention methods and procedures. 




The two Maryland regulations, see section I.A, above, require that operators of motor vehicles transporting regulated
materials, including hazardous materials, pass an examination. The examination is to ensure that the driver is trained
in procedures for identifying and marking regulated materials for transportation, safely transporting regulated
materials and instituting emergency procedures in the event of a spill. The regulations stipulate the required areas
of training, provide for an examination to demonstrate training in those areas, and authorize issuance of a driver's
certificate to identify those who satisfactorily have been trained. These are elements of a ``systematic program''
of ``training requirements.'' Accordingly, the Maryland regulations, as they apply to those transporting hazardous
materials, are subject to 49 CFR 172.701.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00146 </DOCNO>

Both COMAR 26.10.01.16.D, the oil cargo tank operator certification, and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, the hazardous waste
vehicle operator certification, are stricter than the HMR. The HMR impose general and function-specific training
requirements on all hazmat employees. Under 49 CFR 177.816, motor vehicle operators in particular are required to
be trained in an exhaustive number of areas related to the safe transportation of hazardous materials in motor vehicles.
In addition, a hazmat employer must provide for ``appropriate'' testing of its employees. 49 CFR 172.702(d). Unlike
the Maryland regulations, however, the HMR do not condition motor vehicle operation on passing an examination administered
by a governmental body. Cf. Colorado Pub. Util. Comm'n v. Harmon, 951 F.2d at 1581 (requirement to submit proof of training
goes beyond HMR). In addition, COMAR 26.13.04.01.F requires hazardous waste transporters to be trained in specific
areas that the HMR do not, namely, in hazardous waste transportation requirements specific to Maryland laws and regulations.
The HMR do not limit the means by which a hazmat employer may train a driver, provided that training meets the standard
of 49 CFR 172.700(b). Conversely, training received by the operator of a vehicle transporting hazardous waste does
not comply with COMAR 26.13.04.01.F unless the instructor meets the experience requirements set forth at COMAR 26.13.04.01.F(5).

MDE suggests that the training requirements are not an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA because
of 49 CFR 172.702(c), which states: ``Training may be provided by the hazmat employer or other public or private sources.''
This section, however, simply encourages hazmat employers, in training their employees, to make use of any resources,
public or private, that offer training meeting the requirements of the regulations. See 57 FR at 20949-50. It
does not authorize States or other non-Federal entities to impose additional training obligations. 
Determining the extent to which State training requirements may differ from those in the HMR before they become an
obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of the HMTA is a balancing of the State's interest in ensuring the competence
of drivers within its jurisdiction against the cost and administrative burdens on transporters and the confusion,
reduced compliance and decreased safety that may result from a multiplicity of potentially conflicting requirements.
RSPA already has performed that balancing, and the result is codified in 49 CFR 172.701. Because COMAR 26.10.01.16.D
and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F are stricter than HMR training requirements, they violate 49 CFR 172.701 to the extent they
apply to operators not domiciled in Maryland. Therefore, as applied to non-domiciled operators, each Maryland requirement
is an obstacle to accomplishing the full objectives and purposes of the HMTA, and is preempted. As applied to operators
domiciled in Maryland, COMAR 26.10.01.16.D and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F are not preempted. 


V. ``Otherwise Authorized by Federal Law'' 


The HMTA does not preempt a non-Federal requirement that is ``otherwise authorized by Federal law.'' 49 App. U.S.C.
1811(a). MDE asserts that its oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is authorized by sections 102 and
104 of the FWPCA, 33 U.S.C. 1252(a) and 1254(a)(1), and RCRA Subtitle I, 42 U.S.C. 6991 et seq. 
The FWPCA sections cited by MDE do not support its argument. In relevant part, these read as follows: 




The [EPA] Administrator shall, after careful investigation, and in cooperation with other Federal agencies, State
water pollution control agencies, interstate agencies, and the municipalities and industries involved, prepare
or develop comprehensive programs for preventing, reducing, or eliminating the pollution of the navigable waters
and ground waters and improving the sanitary condition of surface and underground waters. 33 U.S.C. 1252(a).

 


The [EPA] Administrator shall establish national programs for the prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution
and as part of such programs shall_





(1) in cooperation with other Federal, State, and local agencies, conduct and promote the coordination and acceleration
of research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, surveys, and studies relating to the causes,
effects, extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination of pollution. 




33 U.S.C. 1254(a)(1).

By their clear terms, these statutes delegate general authority to the EPA Administrator to develop programs and
undertake research to protect surface and groundwater quality. While the Administrator is directed to cooperate
with the States in doing so, no regulatory authority is conferred on the States. 
MDE argues as well that RCRA Subtitle I, regulating underground oil storage tanks, authorizes the oil cargo tank operator
certification requirement of COMAR 26.10.01.16.D. Although Subtitle I regulates underground storage tank systems,
MDE states, ``it is the vehicle operator who transfers the product into and out of these systems.'' According to MDE,
``EPA's approval of the State of Maryland's underground storage tank (UST) program was in part based on its oil vehicle
operator's certification requirements for the safe transfer of oil.'' The elements that a State UST program must
contain to qualify for EPA approval are set forth at 42 U.S.C. 6991c(a); these elements are elaborated in EPA regulations
at 40 CFR part 281. The elements do not include, and the regulations do not mention, regulation of oil transporters.
MDE submits no evidence that Maryland's certification requirement was necessary for EPA approval of the State's
UST program. 
RCRA Subtitle I, at 42 U.S.C. 6991g, provides: 




Nothing in this subtitle shall preclude or deny any right of any State or political subdivision thereof to adopt or
enforce any regulation, requirement, or standard of performance respecting underground storage tanks that is more
stringent than a regulation, requirement, or standard of performance in effect under this subtitle. 




See also 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3). The fact that Subtitle I does not prohibit a State from imposing more stringent regulations
does not protect those regulations from preemption under the HMTA. Indeed, 40 CFR 281.12(a)(3)(ii) states:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00088 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Where an approved state program has a greater scope of coverage than required by federal law, the additional coverage
is not part of the federally-approved program. 




See also PD-1, 57 FR 58848, 58855 (Dec. 11, 1992) (ruling similarly on nearly identical language in RCRA Subtitle
C, 42 U.S.C. 6929). 
In summary, the Maryland oil cargo tank operator certification requirement is not ``otherwise authorized by Federal
law'' within the meaning of 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a). 


VI. Ruling 


For the reasons set forth above, RSPA finds that 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a)(2) preempts Maryland regulations COMAR 26.10.01.16.D
and COMAR 26.13.04.01.F, requiring certification of operators of motor vehicles loading or unloading hazardous
materials in Maryland, as they apply to vehicle operators not domiciled in Maryland. Specifically, these requirements
are stricter than Federal operator training requirements and therefore are obstacles to accomplishing the full
purposes and objectives of the HMTA. As applied to vehicle operators domiciled in Maryland, the requirements are
not preempted. 



VII. Petition for Reconsideration/Judicial Review 


In accordance with 49 CFR 107.211(a), ``[a]ny person aggrieved'' by RSPA's decision on the NTTC/CWTI application
may file a petition for reconsideration within 20 days of service of the decision. Any party to this proceeding may
seek review of RSPA's decision ``by the appropriate district court of the United States * * * within 60 days after such
decision becomes final.'' 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(e). 
This decision will become RSPA's final decision 20 days after service if no petition for reconsideration is filed
within that time. The filing of a petition for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of
this decision under 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(e). 

If a petition for reconsideration is filed within 20 days of service, the action by RSPA's Associate Administrator
for Hazardous Materials Safety on the petition for reconsideration will constitute final agency action. 49 CFR 107.211(d).

Appendix



Application Forms and Instructions



Applicants are advised to reproduce and complete the application forms in this Section. Applicants are required
to submit an original and two copies of each application as provided in this Section.



Frequent Questions



1. Can I get an extension of the due date?

No! On rare occasions the Department of Education may extend a closing date for all applicants. If that occurs, a notice
of the revised due date is published in the 

Federal Register

. However, there are no extensions or exceptions to the due date made for individual applicants.

2. What should be included in the application?

The application should include a project narrative, vitae of key personnel, and a budget, as well as the Assurances
forms included in this package. Vitae of staff or consultants should include the individual's title and role in the
proposed project, and other information that is specifically pertinent to this proposed project. The budgets for
both the first year and all subsequent project years should be included.

If collaboration with another organization is involved in the proposed activity, the application should include
assurances of participation by the other parties, including written agreements or assurances of cooperation. It
is 

not 

useful to include general letters of support or endorsement in the application.

If the applicant proposes to use unique tests or other measurement instruments that are not widely known the field,
it would be helpful to include the instrument in the application.

Many applications contain voluminous appendices that are not helpful and in many cases cannot even be mailed to the
reviewers. It is generally not helpful to include such things as brochures, general capability statements of collaborating
organizations, maps, copies of publications, or descriptions of other projects completed by the applicant.

3. What format should be used for the application?

NIDRR generally advises applicants that they may organize the application to follow the selection criteria that
will be used. The specific review criteria vary according to the specific program, and are contained in this Consolidated
Application Package.

4. May I submit applications to more than one NIDRR program competition or more than one application to a program?

Yes, you may submit applications to any program for which they are responsive to the program requirements. You may
submit the same application to as many competitions as you believe appropriate. You may also submit more than one application
in any given competition.

5. What is the allowable indirect cost rate?

The limits on indirect costs vary according to the program and the type of application.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940603-2-00159 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940603-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Applicants in the FIR and SCI grants programs should limit indirect charges to the organization's approved rate.
If the organization does not have an approved rate, the application should include an estimated actual rate. Applicants
for projects in the Research Training and Career Development program are limited to an indirect rate of 8 percent.
There are no indirect charges permitted in the Fellowship program.

6. Can profitmaking businesses apply for grants?

Yes. However, for-profit organizations will not be able to collect a fee or profit on the grant, and in some programs
will be required to share in the costs of the project.

7. Can individuals apply for grants?

No. Only organizations are eligible to apply for 

grants

 under NIDRR programs. However, individuals are the only entities eligible to apply for fellowships.

8. Can NIDRR staff advise me whether my project is of interest to NIDRR or likely to be funded?

No. NIDRR staff can advise you of the requirements of the program in which you propose to submit your application. However,
staff cannot advise you of whether your subject area or proposed approach is likely to receive approval.

9. How do I assure that my application will be referred to the most appropriate panel for review?

Applicants should be sure that their applications are referred to the correct competition by clearly including the
competition title and CFDA number, including alphabetical code, on the Standard Form 424, and including a project
title that describes the project.

10. How soon after submitting my application can I find out if it will be funded?

The time from closing date to grant award date varies from program to program. Generally speaking, NIDRR endeavors
to have awards made within five to six months of the closing date. Unsuccessful applicants generally will be notified
within that time frame as well. For the purpose of estimating a project start date, the applicant should estimate approximately
six months from the closing date, but no later than the following September 30.

11. Can I call NIDRR to find out if my application is being funded?

No! When NIDRR is able to release information on the status of grant applications, it will notify applicants by letter.
The results of the peer review cannot be released except through this formal notification.

12. Will all approved applications be funded?

No. It often happens that the peer review panels approve for funding more applications than NIDRR can fund within available
resources. Applicants who are approved but not funded are encouraged to consider submitting similar applications
in future competitions.

regulations. The term ``covered entities'' refers to businesses, commercial properties, institutions, State
or local governments or their agencies, and other organizations or enterprises that have responsibilities under
title II or title III of the ADA. 



Grants will be awarded to selected applicants who propose cost-effective and efficient methods of educating entities
and individuals with responsibilities and rights under the ADA as well as professionals, such as practicing architects,
attorneys, building contractors and others, who provide services to these groups and may assist them in understanding
and complying with the requirements of the Act. The primary objective of this program is to encourage and facilitate
voluntary compliance with titles II and III of the ADA and the Department's implementing regulations. Only submissions
that propose projects of national scope or significance will be considered. 

In fiscal year 1994, the Department is seeking grant applications in the following six (6) priority areas: 

(1) Dissemination of ADA informational materials to architects and other design professionals at the local, State,
and regional level;

(6) ``The ADA: Civil Rights Law'' educational audiovisual materials. 
Projects must propose to conduct activities under the grant that have been specifically tailored to meet the particular
needs of the targeted audience. Detailed information regarding these specific priorities may be found in the 

Program Priorities

 section of this solicitation. 
Although the Department has identified the above priorities for grant awards during FY 1994, other meritorious projects
offering innovative methods of providing ADA Technical Assistance are eligible for consideration. In order to be
considered, projects must have a clear statement of need and have national scope or significance. 
The Department anticipates that grants will be awarded in amounts ranging from $85,000 to $200,000.

Background and Program Description 


On January 26, 1992, the major provisions of titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into
effect. The ADA provides legal protection to individuals with disabilities in the areas of public accommodations,
commercial facilities, State and local government services, transportation, and employment. Title III prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in a broad range of public accommodations, commercial facilities and certain
transportation services. Title II prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government
programs and services, including transportation, and State and local government employment. The employment (title
I) and transportation (title II, Subpart B) provisions of the ADA are regulated by other Federal agencies and are not
the subject of this Notice. 
Section 506 of the ADA requires that the Department of Justice render technical assistance to entities and individuals
that have responsibilities or rights under title II (subtitle A, State and local government services) and title III
(public accommodations and commercial facilities) of the ADA. 
Pursuant to this requirement, the Department provides a variety of ADA-related services and information, including:




_A telephone information service (for voice and TTY callers) through which members of the public may obtain recorded
information and place orders for ADA materials 24 hours/day and may discuss questions they have about the ADA with
information specialists during certain business hours. This service has recently been converted to a toll-free
``1-800'' number and the number of hours of staffed service has been expanded; 

_A speaker's bureau through which organizations can arrange to have ADA experts from the Civil Rights Division speak
on a variety of ADA issues; and 
_Distribution of written materials, including the Department's regulations implementing titles II and III, technical
assistance manuals for titles II and III, an ADA Questions and Answers booklet, and other reference materials. These
materials are available in standard print, large print, braille, audiotape, and computer disk. They may also be obtained
through the Civil Rights Division's electronic bulletin board. 



Under section 506(d) of the Act, the Department has authority to award grants to individuals and non-profit entities
for the purpose of supplementing the Department's technical assistance efforts. The Technical Assistance Grant
Program is designed to develop and implement cost-effective and efficient strategies to disseminate information
about the responsibilities and rights of covered entities and individuals under titles II and III of the ADA, with
the goal of fostering understanding of, and facilitating voluntary compliance with, the ADA nationwide. 
This grant program is designed specifically to increase the level of knowledge of the ADA in order to ultimately increase
the level of voluntary compliance with the ADA. The program is not intended to fund or support site-specific compliance
implementation (e.g., funding to make specific facilities more accessible). Nor is it intended to fund or support
inspections, reviews, or tests to determine whether an entity is meeting its compliance obligations. Proposals
to conduct projects of these sorts will not be considered. 
Since the initiation of the grant program in 1991, the Department has awarded grants to 30 non-profit organizations.
The recipients have included a wide range of groups, and the types of projects previously funded include: Projects
to develop and disseminate educational materials, including detailed manuals, brochures and videotapes, to explain
the regulations and how to comply with the ADA; projects to disseminate existing information to targeted audiences;
projects to develop and conduct ADA training programs and seminars; projects to operate telephone information lines
to answer various questions about the provisions of the ADA; and projects to develop and incorporate ADA materials
into professional educational curricula and programs. 
Grantee projects have targeted various audiences of persons with responsibilities under title III or title II of
the ADA, persons with disabilities with rights under the ADA, and persons who, because of their areas of professional
or technical expertise, provide services that may assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements
of the Act.

Title III projects have been directed toward educating owners and operators of restaurants and bars, hotels and motels,
retail stores, grocery stores, professional offices, recreation and fitness centers, museums and other places
of collection, travel and tour agents, hospitals and health care providers, service providers for elderly persons,
day care centers, small shops and stores, and large commercial properties. 
Title II projects have worked toward educating mayors and governing bodies of U.S. cities with populations over 30,000
and towns with populations under 10,000, law enforcement agencies, 911/emergency response operators, state courts,
state social service agencies, public libraries, and persons involved in testing for licensure and certification
purposes. 
While some projects have focused on educating people with disabilities about their rights under titles II and III
of the ADA, others have educated covered entities with responsibilities under the ADA on how to accommodate people
with different kinds of disabilities, such as people with mobility impairments, manual impairments, hearing impairments,
speech impairments, vision impairments, seizure disorders, mental retardation, mental illness, and people with
cognitive, developmental, or learning disabilities. 

Other projects have been directed toward persons who can assist others in complying with the ADA, including professors
and students in architecture, interior design, industrial design, and landscape architecture schools and programs;
state and local building code officials; disability advocates; librarians; and community mediators. Several grant
recipients have directed technical assistance toward persons who speak Spanish and other non-English languages.

Some effective strategies used by grantees have been to integrate ADA Technical Assistance materials into established
programs and the creation of an innovative project conducted on a statewide basis, that can be studied and replicated
by others nationally. For example, the Police Executive Research Forum is creating a set of materials, with some material
specifically developed to be integrated into police academy training and others for use in on-the-job roll-call
training. The set of materials includes a series of modules on protecting the rights of persons with seizure disorders,
speech and hearing impairments, and mental illness. The Chief Officers of State Library Agencies is creating a single
source collection of ADA materials that will be available to the public nationwide through their local libraries.
The National Association of Towns and Townships is producing ADA materials to train regional and state ADA technical
assistance providers to assist them in educating officials from small towns with fewer than 10,000 residents on how
to comply with the ADA.
The American Association of Retired Persons will create materials and conduct training sessions throughout the
country to educate older persons with disabilities about their rights under the ADA. The results of a South Carolina
project, which partners different State agencies and a state-based advocacy organization for persons with mental
illness to examine and correct ways in which social service and public benefit programs discriminate against persons
with mental illness, will be disseminated nationwide. 
A description of all projects, including a list of materials that have been or are being produced by grant recipients,
may be obtained by calling 1-800-514-0301 (Voice) or 1-800-514-0383 (TTY) or
the electronic bulletin board at (202) 514-6193. 
Applicants should be aware that the Department does not fund projects to research or resolve issues that are outside
the scope of the Department's current ADA regulations and court interpretations. For example, the Department would
not fund a project concerning the design of accessible physical environments for children because standards have
not yet been adopted by the Department in this area. 
Only proposals to conduct projects of national scope or significance will be considered. For example, a professional
or trade association at the national level that proposes to target educational information to its membership nationwide
might be funded. A local or state trade association with no national affiliation or reach would not be funded, unless
the local or state group could adequately demonstrate its ability to draw national attention to, and participation
in, its project. 
The Department is particularly interested in receiving proposals that: specifically address how members of minority
communities will be included within the population targeted by the applicant for receipt of technical assistance;
reflect an ability to begin project activities in an expedited manner; utilize materials already developed by Federal
agencies and their grantees or contractors; represent joint ventures between organizations that represent persons
with disabilities and organizations that provide services that may assist covered entities in their compliance
efforts; and engage national membership organizations in supporting the project's objectives. 


Eligible Applicants. 

This grant competition is open to individuals and to non-profit organizations, including trade and professional
associations or their subsidiaries, organizations representing State and local governments or their employees,
other organizations representing entities covered by the ADA, State and local government agencies, and national
and local organizations representing persons with disabilities.

Program Priorities 



Since the inception of the ADA Technical Assistance Grant Program in 1991, the Department has funded over 30 projects,
with the primary focus being to educate entities and individuals with responsibilities and rights under titles II
and III of the ADA. Many of the audiences targeted have been those with title III responsibilities, including owners
and operators of retail stores, supermarkets, hotels and motels, day care centers, and health care and other service
providers. Projects directed toward educating those with obligations under title II have included law enforcement
agencies, state court systems, 911/emergency response operators, city and town governing bodies, and publicly
funded hospitals and other health care services. Targeted audiences have also included people with disabilities
with rights under titles II and/or III. 

As the purpose of the Grant Program is to promote and facilitate voluntary compliance with the ADA, the Department
believes that it is necessary to identify, educate and work with professionals at the local, State, and regional level
who, because of their professional or technical expertise, provide services to the above audiences and may assist
them in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. For this reason, the Department has expressed
a particular interest in receiving proposals that target this specific audience in the following six priority areas:




Priority 1: Dissemination of ADA informational materials to architects and other design professionals at the local,
State, and regional level

. Architects and other design professionals play an essential role in ensuring that newly constructed facilities
and additions or alterations to existing facilities are designed and built in accordance with the ADA Standards for
Accessible Design. Businesses, State and local governments, service agencies and other ADA covered entities rely
on the knowledge and expertise of the architect; they expect that the professional will design a building or facility
that will meet a myriad of needs, one of which is compliance with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. 

With access to educational materials and services, architects and design professionals at the local level can help
business owners comply with the ADA and reduce claims of discrimination by people with disabilities based on inaccessible
facilities or elements. Since the enactment of the ADA, a wealth of educational material on complying with the accessible
design requirements has been developed by Federal agencies to be used by entities and individuals with responsibilities
and rights under the ADA and professionals who may provide services that will assist these groups in understanding
and complying with the requirements of the Act. Examples of such information include the Department of Justice's


ADA Standards for Accessible Design

, and titles II and III 

Technical Assistance Manuals

; the Access Board's 

ADA Accessibility Guidelines Checklist 

and various 

Technical Assistance Bulletins 

(addressing accessibility topics such as detectable warnings, visual alarms, TTYs, slip-resistant surfaces and
using ADAAG). Other materials have been produced through federally funded grant programs and examples include DOJ
funded projects such as the American Hotel and Motel Association's 

Accommodating All Guests 

compliance manual, the Food Marketing Institute's 

ADA Starter Kit for Supermarkets 

and the 

ADA Compliance Manual for Supermarkets

, and the National Restaurant Association's 

ADA: Answers for Foodservice Operators 

compliance manual and 

A Warm Welcome 

videotape on compliance for the food service industry. Examples of grants funded through the National Institute
on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) include numerous 

ADA Design Tech Sheets 

(illustrated technical materials addressing such topics as signage, areas of rescue assistance, accessible route,
ATMs, curb ramps, ground and floor surfaces, etc.), and the 

Title II Action Guide for State and Local Governments

. 

The Government has also created a variety of informational services, such as the Department of Justice's toll-free
ADA Information Line, through which individuals can speak directly with an ADA Specialist, or access recorded information
about the requirements of the ADA 24 hours a day. Information about the ADA may also be downloaded through the Department's
Electronic Bulletin Board. Similar services are available through other Federal agencies. 

Despite the existence of these materials, many of which are available free of charge from the Department and other
Federal agencies, many professionals at the local level are unaware of their availability and continue to design
and build facilities that do not comply with the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. 

The goal of Priority 1 is to develop a nationwide system to inform architects and design professionals about the ADA
and the availability of these informational materials and services to ensure dissemination of existing ADA materials
to practicing architects and other design professionals at the local level. The project should utilize existing
channels, such as professional and trade organizations, trade publications, meetings, and electronic media to
inform as wide an audience of design professionals as possible of the availability of informational materials and
services and to assist with dissemination. In establishing this system, the project should seek to establish links
between existing Federal information resources and private dissemination channels and implement an approach through
which the Department can continue to disseminate new materials to targeted audiences, as they are developed, on an
on-going, long-term basis following the conclusion of the grant period. Types of mechanisms that could be used to
accomplish this might include the development of articles for publication in trade journals, the distribution of
sample or resource packets to architectural libraries, the presentation of information about the ADA and the availability
of Federal resources and materials through computer networks and electronic media, etc.

Priority 1 is an ADA informational materials dissemination project for architects and design professionals at the
local, State, and regional levels that shall include the following major components: 


 


_Identify and compile specific materials that have been or are being developed by the Department of Justice, its grant
recipients, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research's grant recipients, the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board and other Federal agencies as appropriate that the applicant intends
to publicize to the targeted populations; 

_Identify professional and trade organizations that serve architects and design professionals that have regional,
state and local affiliations through which information and materials could be disseminated; 

_Identify professional and trade journals and other publications through which the availability of materials can
be publicized at the local, State, and regional levels; 

_Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of
the project's activities; 

_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including professionals serving racial and
ethnic minority communities; 

_Develop a plan to effectively publicize and disseminate the availability of material available from Federal agencies
and their grantees, utilizing, to the extent possible, existing dissemination mechanisms for architects and design
professionals including professional and trade journals, regional and national conferences, etc. Such a plan should
ensure that the dissemination of materials will continue after the grant period has ended; 

_Develop, reproduce and disseminate marketing materials such as pamphlets, flyers, articles, ad slicks or other
products necessary to inform architects and design professionals of the availability of ADA materials; 

_Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; 

_Coordinate with the Department to ensure that future new or updated materials will continue to be disseminated to
professionals at the local level following the conclusion of the grant period; 

_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate
to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience. 






Priority 2: Dissemination of ADA informational materials to building contractors, construction tradespeople,
building inspectors and plan reviewers at the local, State, and regional levels

. Building contractors, construction tradespeople, building inspectors and plan reviewers play an essential role
in ensuring that new construction, additions, and alterations are accessible. Many smaller projects, particularly
alterations, are accomplished by contractors and tradespeople without the use of architects or other design professionals.
Business owners, State and local governments, service agencies and other ADA covered entities rely on the knowledge
and expertise of builders to meet a myriad of needs, one of which is compliance with the ADA Standards for Accessible
Design; and contractors and tradespeople rely on building inspectors and plan reviewers for advice and assistance
in understanding and applying these rules. 

With access to educational materials and services, building contractors and skilled construction tradespeople
at the local level can help business owners comply with the ADA and reduce claims of discrimination by people with disabilities
based on inaccessible facilities or elements. Since the enactment of the ADA, a wealth of educational material on
complying with the accessible design requirements has been developed by Federal agencies for use by entities and
individuals with responsibilities and rights under the ADA and professionals who may provide services that will
assist these groups in understanding and complying with the requirements of the Act. Examples of such information
include the Department of Justice's ADA Standards for Accessible Design, and title II and III Technical Assistance
Manuals; the Access Board's ADA Accessibility Guidelines Checklist and various Technical Assistance Bulletins
(addressing accessibility topics such as detectable warnings, visual alarms, TTYs, slip-resistant surfaces and
using ADAAG). Other materials have been produced through federally funded grant programs and examples include DOJ
funded projects such as the American Hotel and Motel Association's Accommodating All Guests compliance manual,
the Food Marketing Institute's ADA Starter Kit for Supermarkets and the ADA Compliance Manual for Supermarkets,
and the National Restaurant Association's ADA: Answers for Foodservice Operators compliance manual and A Warm Welcome
videotape on compliance for the food service industry. Examples of grants funded through the National Institute
on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) include numerous ADA Design Tech Sheets (illustrated technical
materials addressing such topics as signage, areas of rescue assistance, accessible route, ATMs, curb ramps, ground
and floor surfaces, etc.), and the Title II Action Guide for State and Local Governments.

The goal of Priority 2 is to develop a nationwide system to inform building contractors, construction tradespeople,
building inspectors and plan reviewers about the ADA and the availability of these informational materials and services
to ensure the dissemination of existing ADA materials to contractors and others at the local level. The project should
utilize existing channels, such as trade organizations, trade publications, meetings, and electronic media to
inform as wide an audience of contractors and others as possible of the availability of the material and to assist with
dissemination. In establishing this system, the project should seek to establish links between existing Federal
information resources and private dissemination channels and implement an approach through which the Department
can continue to disseminate new materials, as they are developed, on an on-going, long-term basis following the conclusion
of the grant period. Types of mechanisms that could be used to accomplish this might include the development of articles
for publication in trade journals, the distribution of sample or resource packets to libraries serving the target
population, the presentation of information about the ADA and the availability of Federal resources and materials,
and making the same available through computer networks and other electronic media. 
Priority 2 is an ADA informational materials dissemination project for building contractors, construction tradespeople
and others at the local, State, and regional level that shall include the following major components: 



_Identify and compile specific materials that have been or are being developed by the Department of Justice, its grant
recipients, the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research's grant recipients, the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board 
and other Federal agencies as appropriate that the applicant intends to publicize to the populations to be served
by the project; 

_Identify professional and trade organizations serving the targeted population with regional, State and local
affiliations through which information and materials could be disseminated; 
_Identify professional and trade journals and other publications through which the availability of materials can
be publicized at the local, State, and regional level; 
_Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of
the project's activities; 
_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;

_Develop a plan to effectively publicize and disseminate the availability of material available from Federal resources
and their grantees utilizing, to the extent possible, existing dissemination mechanisms for the targeted population
including professional and trade journals, regional and national conferences, etc.; 



Such a plan should ensure that dissemination will continue after the grant period has ended; 



_Develop, reproduce and disseminate marketing materials such as pamphlets, flyers, articles, ad slicks or other
products necessary to inform the targeted population of the availability of ADA materials; 
_Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; 
_Coordinate with the Department to ensure that future new or updated materials will continue to be disseminated to
the targeted population at the local level following the conclusion of the grant period; 
_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate

Priority 3: ADA education for State and local historic preservation offices, historic preservation committees
and boards, and local zoning and code officials involved in historic preservation decisions.

 Staff and officials of State and local historic preservation offices, members of historic preservation committees
and boards, and local zoning and code officials involved in historic preservation decisions need guidance on effective
methods of complying with the ADA without destroying the historic nature of the facility or element. While some educational
materials currently exist, the need for these audiences to learn about and understand how to implement practical
solutions remains paramount. 
The goal of Priority 3 is to undertake a nationwide effort to educate State and local historic preservation offices,
historic preservation committees and boards, and zoning and code officials involved in historic preservation decisions
on the requirements of the ADA and how to maintain the integrity of the historic property while providing accessibility
as required under the ADA that promotes independence and dignity. Projects of this type should focus specifically
on providing practical solutions to access problems faced by historic properties. Projects to develop and disseminate
educational materials, to develop and conduct training using existing materials, or to develop materials and conduct
training will be considered. 
Priority 3 is an ADA education project for historic preservation officials that shall include the following major
components: 



_Develop educational materials that focus on solutions to access problems specific to properties such as historic
museums, historic buildings housing public accommodations and those housing State and local government programs.
The materials shall illustrate how people with disabilities use the built environment and how the provisions of the
ADA Standards for Accessible Design can be effectively used to provide mainstream access without destroying the
historic significance of the building or facility; 
_Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of
the project's activities; 
_Identify and coordinate with established professional organizations, such as the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, the National Conference of State Historical Preservation Officers, and State Historical Commissions,
etc., through which information and materials could be disseminated; 
_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;

_Utilize existing federally approved materials to the maximum extent possible; 

_Develop and implement a strategy to disseminate the materials nationally, coordinating with other state and national
historic preservation organizations as appropriate; 
_If the project includes a training component, identify topics to be covered and the rationale for selecting those
topics and develop and implement a plan to select trainers; 
_If the project includes training, a minimum of five regional sessions should be held. Criteria to be used to select
the training locations should be carefully thought out and described in the applicant's proposal; 
_Develop and implement a strategy to publicize information about the ADA and the availability of materials and training
sessions nationally through organizations, print and electronic media; 
_Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; 
_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate
to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience.

Priority 4: ADA education for staff of legal services offices, legal aid societies, and public interest law centers.

 For a person with a disability, access to technical assistance and good legal advice about the ADA is severely limited
by the lack of public interest lawyers trained in the requirements of the ADA. The right to legal advice and their right
to file private lawsuits is a critical component of the ADA. 
According to the latest census data, over 20% of the 12.9 million people of working age reporting the presence of a work
disability have family incomes below the Federal poverty threshold. Because of this, people with disabilities are
consistently being referred to public interest law centers, legal services offices, and legal aid societies for
affordable legal assistance, and yet the vast majority of staff at those offices have not been even minimally trained
on the requirements of the ADA. For the high percentage of individuals with disabilities who rely on low-cost or free
legal services, it is critical to the successful implementation of the ADA that these lawyers receive training on
the ADA. 
The goal of Priority 4 is to develop and conduct a nationwide training program for staff and boards of legal services
offices, legal aid societies, and public interest law centers about titles II and III of the ADA. 

Priority 4 is an ADA project to educate legal services, legal aid societies and public interest law centers that shall
include the following major components:




_Develop and conduct a minimum of five regional ADA training seminars; 

_Establish size of target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of
the project's activities; 

_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including legal groups serving racial and
ethnic minority communities; 

_Develop innovative approaches to reach the widest possible audience with funds available; 

_Identify and select for training staff and board members of public interest law centers, legal services groups,
and legal aid societies from throughout the United States. The following factors should be considered in the selection
process: geographical representation from the 50 states; representation from urban, suburban, and rural areas;
representation from legal groups serving citizens with minority backgrounds; 

_Develop a plan for publicizing the availability of the training, using, to the extent possible, existing dissemination
mechanisms for legal services and public interest law centers including publications, professional journals,
local, state, and national meetings, etc.; 

_Develop training materials and activities appropriate to public interest lawyers, utilizing existing federally
approved materials to the maximum extent possible; 

_Provide training to selected staff and board members of public interest law centers, legal aid societies, and legal
services groups on title II and title III of the ADA and on recent policy developments; 

_Create articles on the requirements of the ADA for publication in media appropriate to target audience; 

_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate
to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience.






Priority 5: ADA education and pilot project for professional mediators.

 The ADA encourages the use of means other than litigation to resolve ADA disputes. Professional mediators provide
an alternative forum for complainants and respondents to resolve their misunderstandings or disagreements about
the ADA's requirements. Effective use of professional mediators trained to mediate ADA cases can help bring about
compliance with the ADA, while saving both parties from the high costs, delays, and inconveniences often associated
with litigation. 
The goal of Priority 5 is to train a select number of professional mediators nationwide about title III of the ADA, refer
title III cases to these mediators for mediation, monitor the outcome of mediation efforts, and evaluate and disseminate
the evaluation of the project to mediators and other interested parties nationwide, so that the project can be effectively
replicated in other areas of the country. 
Priority 5 is an ADA education and pilot project for professional mediators that shall include the following major
components:

Priority 6: ``The ADA: Civil Rights Law'' educational videotape.

 Lack of recognition that the ADA is a civil rights law, long held myths and stereotypes, and ignorance about the attitudinal
and physical discrimination that people with disabilities face in their daily lives_not being able to enter the building
to attend a child's school play; not being allowed to play on a sports team or participate in the town meeting; not being
able to order a hamburger, drop off dry cleaning, or to rent a car_are thought to be major impediments to voluntary compliance
with the ADA. 
The goal of Priority 6 is to produce and disseminate educational audiovisual materials illustrating discrimination,
stereotypes and attitudinal barriers encountered by people with disabilities. The goal of this project is to identify
the ADA as a civil rights law, distinct from a ``benefit program'', with the same historical background and battles
associated with other types of civil rights legislation. The project will draw comparisons between discrimination
encountered by people with disabilities and other protected classes of individuals and the historical struggle
people with disabilities and others faced to gain the right to equality. Finally, the project will focus on the impact
that complying with the ADA can have on changing stereotypes, eliminating barriers, and increasing access to goods,
services, and activities. 
Educating the public about the abilities of people with disabilities to function well in an accessible environment
and dispelling oft held myths and stereotypes can lead to increased voluntary compliance with the ADA. Materials
developed in this project shall portray persons with disabilities in a positive manner and will be used to increase
the general public's awareness of disability, accessibility and the ADA and its historical place in the development
of civil rights legislation. The project should also strive to increase the level of communication between covered
entities, people with disabilities, and providers of consultation services. 
Priority 6 is an ADA educational audiovisual project that shall include the following major components: 




_Create and disseminate broadcast quality educational videotapes, identifying the ADA as a civil rights law with
protection for people with disabilities parallel to that provided under other civil rights legislation; 
_Edit to provide videotapes of varying lengths, suitable for use in a variety of broadcast situations (e.g., short
segments to be used to promote the videotape or on magazine type programs, longer segments for viewing by audiences
attending a meeting, etc.); 
_Identify target audience and state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's
activities; 
_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;

_Identify types of attitudinal and physical discrimination that prevent people with disabilities from gaining
equal opportunity and possible methods to eliminate discrimination; 
_Illustrate the increased independence persons with disabilities experience when barriers are removed;

Other Meritorious Projects.

 The Department also seeks grant applications involving other meritorious projects that offer innovative methods
of providing ADA Technical Assistance to entities and individuals with rights and responsibilities under the ADA
and professionals who provide services to these groups and may assist them in understanding and complying with the
ADA. Only those projects with a clear statement of need and of national scope or significance will be considered. Other
Meritorious Projects shall include the following major components: 






_Statement of need. Applicants should indicate why their project is needed and how they have determined that the issues
or topics they intend to address are, in fact, the issues or topics that will best serve the needs of the population for
whom the project has been designed. Some populations, for example, may need to be made aware of the ADA and be provided
with basic information, while others may be familiar with the basic legal requirements, but need information on how
to translate the legal standards into concrete, practical solutions for achieving compliance. Others may need in-depth
education on specific aspects of the law; 

_Description of the target audience by describing such factors as geographic scope, type of population (type of business,
type of governmental unit, type of disability, type of professional service offered), or other relevant characteristics.
Applicants should also state explicitly the number of people expected to be served in the course of the project's activities;


_Specify how the project will reach all parts of the targeted audience, including racial and ethnic minority communities;


_Provide a statement of goals and objectives of the project. Applicants should describe in concrete terms what is
to be accomplished during the project period. The anticipated impact on voluntary compliance efforts should also
be clearly articulated; 

_Develop a plan to disseminate the materials or results of the project nationwide; 

_Work with and through established organizations, where possible, to reach the largest segment of the population
possible; 

_Utilize existing Federally-approved materials to the maximum extent possible; 

_Develop a plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the project and how the proposed evaluation criteria will indicate
to what degree the project succeeded in meeting its stated objectives and reaching the targeted audience.

Staff Capability (25 Points)



 Applicants must provide evidence of qualified personnel with particular experience in the areas addressed in the
application. The application must contain necessary position descriptions, resumes, and assurances of availability
of staff (existing and contract staff) with appropriate competencies and experience. Duties outlined for grant-funded
positions must be clearly appropriate to the scope of the work being carried out under the project. 



Organizational Capability and Management Plan (20 Points)


 Applicants must demonstrate the ability to effectively reach and work with the targeted audience and offer evidence
of proven organizational ability to provide high quality results utilizing appropriate key personnel. Applications
must include a management plan that provides evidence of project control by management, efficient and timely use
of staff and other resources, and effective quality control mechanisms. 



Resources/Facilities/Equipment (5 Points)


 Applicants must demonstrate the availability and appropriateness of resources (other than personnel), physical
facilities, and equipment proposed to be used to carry out the project. 



General Requirements for Grant Recipients 



The following general grant program requirements should be considered by each applicant in developing both its project
timeline and budget. Successful applicants must adhere to all conditions as specified; any deviation from the requirements
in this section must be negotiated with DOJ. 



Grantee Orientation and Coordination.

 Grantees are expected to coordinate their project activities, where appropriate, with other Federally sponsored
ADA technical assistance activities, including those of the Department of Justice (DOJ), the National Institute
on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance
Board (ATBCB), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and their grantees. The purpose of this coordination
is to avoid duplication of effort, to utilize materials already developed by Federal agencies and grant recipients,
and to otherwise refer to and take advantage of ADA resources that have already been developed. Additionally, successful
applicants will receive an orientation that will familiarize them with projects being undertaken by other successful
applicants. Thereafter, 1994 grantees will be expected to exchange information and provide support to each other
where appropriate. 



Evaluation.

 One goal of this grant program is to determine which education, information dissemination, and compliance assistance
strategies are most effective in reaching as many persons as possible in the targeted population with information
that serves their particular needs. It is therefore essential that each project describe reliable and objective
criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the project at the conclusion of the period of performance and to provide
this information to the Department. 



Post-Award Monitoring.

 The Department intends to provide grant recipients with the maximum amount of post-award guidance and technical
assistance possible within budget and staff constraints. Within approximately one month of the grant award, the
Department will conduct a one-day training session on the ADA and grant management procedures. Each grant recipient
will be invited to send two staff persons to this training session. Funds for travel to Washington, D.C. for this training
should be included in the proposed grant budget. Applicants are also advised that DOJ staff will make periodic site
visits to provide grant recipients with guidance and technical assistance and to monitor the progress of the grant.
The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), a component of the Department of Justice, will provide financial management
and other services in support of the Public Access Section in the administration of this program. Applicants are advised
that copies of the quarterly progress reports sent to OJP must also be sent to the Public Access Section. 



DOJ Review of Grantee Materials.

 All materials used or developed by grant recipients must be approved by DOJ in advance of use. Applicants should anticipate
careful review of any newly developed materials by the Department to ensure that the materials are legally accurate
and should allow ample time in their proposed project schedules for this review. 

Particular attention should be paid to budgetary and staffing needs to ensure that materials to be disseminated will
reach the targeted population in a timely manner during the grant period. 



Availability of Existing DOJ Materials.

 Publications that are currently available free of charge from the Department of Justice (DOJ) will be provided to
the grantee as resources permit. If an applicant intends to disseminate materials of a nature similar to materials
produced by previous DOJ grant recipients or recipients of grants from other Federal agencies, including the National
Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, it should coordinate such requests with the Department. In
general, funds for the reproduction of such materials should be included in the proposed grant budget. 





Copyrights.

 Grant recipients are free to copyright any materials they develop, if they so choose, and may continue to reproduce
and distribute such materials after the grant period is over. Applicants should be aware that DOJ retains the right
to reproduce their materials and to disseminate them to the public at its will, without payment of royalties to the
grantee.

Program Income. 

Grantee recipients may charge for grant-related activities and products (e.g., materials developed and disseminated,
workshop or training registration fees), as long as all income derived from such activities and products is added
to funds committed to the grant and its activities. Specifically, this program income (gross income earned by the
grantee, during the funding period, as a direct result of the grant award or its activities) must be used for purposes
that further eligible program objectives (e.g., obtaining equipment or other assets required for the program).
Program income may not be used to support or further a grantee's general organization, its programs or its services.




Consultative Services. 

Applicants who offer consultative services for a fee to assist covered entities in complying with their ADA responsibilities
or who provide legal representation services for free or for a fee to, or on behalf of, persons with disabilities should
include a statement briefly describing the services provided. 



Alternate Formats (Print and Audiovisual). 

All materials produced in standard print must also be produced in large print, in Braille, and on audiotape in proportion
to anticipated demand by persons with vision impairments in the targeted population(s). Audiotapes of lengthy materials
must be voice- or tone-indexed. 

All copies of any videotapes produced must either be open-captioned or closed-captioned for persons with hearing
impairments. If videotapes contain significant visual action, some of the closed-captioned tapes must be audio-described
for persons with vision impairments. 



Effective Communication and Accessibility Requirements. 

If applicants propose to charge a fee for the materials they produce and disseminate, they must charge the same fee
for alternate formats as for standard formats. 

Applicants who plan to list a voice telephone number on correspondence or promotional materials concerning the grant
activities, or on materials produced under the grant, must also list a TTY telephone number. Applicants who do not
have a TTY may include the cost of purchasing one in the proposed project budget. 

Applicants who plan to use an automated telephone information system to respond to voice calls concerning grant activities
must provide comparable service for TTY users. The cost of establishing an automated TTY information system may not
be included in the proposed project budget.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of affirmative preliminary determination of circumvention of antidumping duty order.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce received an allegation of circumvention of the antidumping duty order
on steel wire rope from Mexico. Pursuant to that allegation, the Department of Commerce initiated a circumvention
inquiry on September 17, 1993, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 27, 1993 (58 FR 50349). 


The Department of Commerce has conducted that inquiry and preliminarily determines that imports into the United
States of steel wire strand from Mexico, which are assembled in the United States into steel wire rope for sale in the
United States, are circumventing the antidumping duty order on steel wire rope from Mexico within the meaning of section
781(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and 19 CFR 353.29(e). Interested parties are invited to comment on this
preliminary determination. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On May 26, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) received a petition filed by the Committee of Domestic
Steel Wire Rope and Specialty Cable Manufacturers (the Committee) requesting an investigation to determine whether
imports of steel wire strand (also known as stranded wire or strand) are circumventing the antidumping duty order
on steel wire rope from Mexico (58 FR 16173, March 25, 1993) within the meaning of section 781(a) of the Tariff Act of
1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Subsequent submissions from the Committee, addressing deficiencies in the original
request, were received on August 13, August 18, and August 20, 1993. On April 11, 1994, the Committee submitted copies
of the Census Bureau data that it had summarized in earlier submissions. On September 27, 1993, the Department published
in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of Initiation of Anticircumvention Inquiry; Steel Wire Rope from Mexico (58 FR 50349). The inquiry covers
the period from October 1, 1992 to September 30, 1993. 
On November 19, 1993, the Department issued a questionnaire to Grupo Camesa S.A. de C.V. (Grupo Camesa) and its United
States affiliate, Camesa Inc. (collectively, Camesa). Camesa responded to the questionnaire on December 20, 1993.
The Department determined that this submission was deficient and issued a supplemental questionnaire on January
31, 1994. The Department received a response to the supplemental questionnaire on 
February 16, 1994. On March 15, 1994, the Committee submitted comments with respect to Camesa's responses. 


Scope of Antidumping Duty Order 


The product covered by the order is steel wire rope, which is defined in the Department's antidumping duty order on
steel wire rope from Mexico as: ``ropes, cables, and cordage of iron or carbon steel, other than stranded wire, not
fitted with fittings or made up into articles, and not made up of plated wire.'' 
During the period of this inquiry (POI), such merchandise was classifiable under subheadings 7312.10.9030, 7312.10.9060,
and 7312.10.9090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and for Customs
purposes. The Department's written description of the scope of the order remains dispositive.

Scope of the Anticircumvention Inquiry 


Products subject to the circumvention inquiry are entries of strand, which are defined as stranded wire having a lay
or twist of not more than 1 revolution for a length equal to the strand diameter multiplied by 8.5. During the POI, such
merchandise was classifiable under subheading 7312.10.3020 of the HTS. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience
and for Customs purposes. The Department's written description of the scope of the inquiry remains dispositive.



Nature of the Circumvention Inquiry 


Section 781(a)(1) of the Tariff Act provides that if: 
(A) A product sold in the United States is of the same class or kind as merchandise that is the subject of an order, and

(B) Such product sold in the United States is completed or assembled in the United States from parts or components produced
in the foreign country with respect to which such order applies, and 
(C) The difference between the value of such product sold in the United States and the value of the imported parts and
components referred to in (B) above is small, 

the Department, after taking into account any advice provided by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC),
may include within the scope of such order the imported parts or components referred to in paragraph (B) above that
are used in the completion or assembly of the merchandise in the United States at any time such order is in effect. Section
781(a)(2) of the Tariff Act further provides that, in determining whether to include parts or components in an antidumping
duty order, the Department shall take into account such factors as (A) pattern of trade; 
(B) whether the manufacturer or exporter of the parts or components is related to the person who assembles or completes
the merchandise sold in the United States from the parts or components produced in the foreign country with respect
to which the order applies, and (C) whether imports into the United States of the parts or components produced in such
foreign country have increased after the issuance of such order. 


I. Statutory Criteria 


(A) Class or Kind of Merchandise 


In this inquiry, the merchandise completed at Camesa Inc.'s Rosenberg, Texas, facility and sold in the United States
is steel wire rope. As the antidumping duty order encompasses ``ropes, cables, and cordage of iron or carbon steel,
other than stranded wire, not fitted with fittings or made up into articles, and not made up of plated wire,'' the steel
wire rope sold in the United States is of the same class or kind of merchandise as that subject to the antidumping duty
order on steel wire rope from Mexico. 


(B) Parts/Components Produced in the Country to Which the Order Applies 


The component of wire rope being imported is defined as stranded wire having a lay or twist of not more than 1 revolution
for a length equal to the strand diameter multiplied by 8.5. This strand is produced by Grupo Camesa in Mexico, imported
into the United States for closure into steel wire rope at the Camesa Inc. facility at Rosenberg, Texas, and subsequently
sold in the United States by Camesa Inc. 


(C) Difference in Value 


In this anticircumvention inquiry, we attempted to base our analysis of the difference in value on both a quantitative
analysis of the value of the finishing process in the United States, and a qualitative analysis of the nature of the
processing performed in the United States. This approach is consistent with our analysis in previous anti-circumvention
inquiries. See, e.g., Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from the People's Republic of China; Affirmative
Final Determination of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order, 59 FR 15155 (March 31, 1994).

<PARENT> FR940603-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


Generally, in an anticircumvention inquiry, a quantitative analysis is based on a comparison of the value between
the finished product sold in the United States and the value of the component imported from the country to which the
order applies. See, e.g., Granular Polytetrafluoroethylene Resin from Italy, Preliminary Affirmative Determination
of Circumvention of Antidumping Duty Order, 57 FR 43218 (September 18, 1992). However, in order to make an effective
comparison, the Department must ascertain that it is using the appropriate value for the imported component. To that
end, we provided the respondent with three options for demonstrating that the price of the wire strand imported by
Camesa Inc. from Grupo Camesa represented a valid market price for use in our difference-in-value calculation. The
options were as follows: (1) Sales prices for strand sold to unrelated parties in the home market and largest third
country market; (2) purchase prices paid to unrelated suppliers in Mexico by Grupo Camesa for strand; or (3) monthly
weighted-average manufacturing costs for strand sold to Camesa Inc. during the POI. In order for us to ascertain the
value of the completed merchandise sold in the United States, we also requested that Camesa provide cost data relevant
to the production of steel wire rope in the United States. 



Camesa, however, failed to provide any of the requested information. Instead, Camesa provided a single price quotation
from a supplier in a third country. Camesa's failure to provide the requested information prevented the Department
from determining whether the difference between the value of the steel wire rope sold in the United States and the value
of the strand produced in Mexico is small. Accordingly, the Department is required to rely on the best information
available (BIA), pursuant to section 776(c) of the Tariff Act, to make the determination. 



In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations at 19 CFR 353.37(b) state that the Department may take
into account whether a party refuses to provide requested information. Thus, the Department may determine, on a case-by-case
basis, what constitutes BIA. 



Because Camesa refused to provide the requested information, as BIA, we preliminarily determine that the quantitative
difference between the value of the finished steel wire rope sold in the United States and the value of the strand produced
in Mexico is small. This eliminates the need for the Department's qualitative analysis of the nature of the processing
Camesa Inc. performed in the United States. However, we note that the result of a qualitative analysis supports the
BIA assumption that the difference between the value of the imported strand and the value of the finished rope is small,
as discussed below.

According to the description of the manufacturing process provided by the ITC in its final affirmative determination
of injury (as discussed in the following paragraphs) concerning imports of steel wire rope from Argentina and Mexico
(see Steel Wire Rope from Argentina and Mexico, Determinations of the Commission in Investigations Nos. 731-TA-457
and 479 (Final) Under the Tariff Act of 1930, Together With the Information Obtained in the Investigations, August
1991, pages A17-A21), the manufacturing process for steel wire rope consists of three major steps: (1) Drawing
rod into wire, (2) stranding wire, and (3) closing strands into rope. Camesa Inc. performs only the closing process
in the United States. 



In the first step, steel wire rod is heat treated (called patenting), coated, cleaned, and reduced to a smaller diameter
through a series of dies to wire. Depending on the amount of reduction during drawing (called the draft), the wire may
also undergo patenting and re-drawing to a smaller diameter. 



In the second step, strands are formed in a single operation from individual wires laid about a core so that all wires
in a strand can move in unison to distribute load and bending stresses equally. This is achieved with ``tubular'' or
``planetary'' stranding machines. Strand used for making wire rope is generally lubricated as the wires move into
the stranding die. After emerging from the stranding die, the strand is frequently ``postformed,'' a process that
involves passing the strand through a series of straightening rollers in order to remove excessive twist. The strand
may be die-formed or flattened, or coated at this point. 



The third step, the finishing operation, is called ``closing'' and is accomplished on a tubular or planetary closer,
operating in a manner similar to tubular or planetary stranders. Spools or bobbins of strand are placed in cradles
in the closer to dispense simultaneously all strands of a sufficient length needed to make a single rope without a splice.
The closing die presses the strands together, forming the rope. 



Based on the above description of the manufacturing process for steel wire rope, we preliminarily determine that
the finishing operation performed by Camesa Inc. in the United States represents a minor portion of the manufacturing
process of steel wire rope, and adds minor value when compared to the production of the wire strand, as alleged by the
petitioner in its anticircumvention inquiry request. 



The Department has determined, based on BIA, that the quantitative difference between the value of the steel wire
rope sold in the United States and the value of the wire strand produced in Mexico is small. Though not necessary for
this conclusion, the Department further notes that a qualitative analysis of the manufacturing process for steel
wire rope demonstrates that the finishing operation performed by Camesa Inc. represents a minor portion of the manufacturing
process of steel wire rope. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the difference between the value of the strand
produced in Mexico and the value of the wire rope sold in the United States is small within the meaning of section 781(a)
of the Tariff Act. 




II. Factors 





In accordance with section 781(a)(2) of the Tariff Act, the Department considered the following factors in determining
whether to include strand within the order: (A) The pattern of trade, (B) whether the manufacturer or exporter of the
parts or components is related to the person who assembles or completes the merchandise sold in the United States from
the parts or components produced in the foreign country with respect to which the order applies, and (C) whether imports
into the United States of the parts or components produced in such foreign country have increased after the issuance
of such order. 




(A) Pattern of Trade 





Generally, the Department considers circumvention to be more likely when the imports of the merchandise subject
to the order have decreased. To evaluate the pattern of trade in this case, we examined the timing and quantities of
exports of steel wire rope from Mexico to the United States during the POI. We also examined the timing and quantities
of Camesa's imports into the United States of steel wire rope produced by Grupo Camesa in Mexico. 



U.S. Census Bureau (Census Bureau) statistics indicate that, during the nine months prior to the POI, steel wire rope
imports from Mexico to the United States averaged 316.44 net tons per month. However, during the first half of the POI,
imports of steel wire rope from Mexico dropped to an average of ten net tons per month. Census Bureau statistics for
the second half of the POI were not available. 



Although Camesa imported steel wire rope from Mexico to the United States prior to the POI, Camesa had no such imports
of steel wire rope during the POI. Thus, the pattern of trade of imports of merchandise subject to the order indicates
that circumvention may have occurred during the POI.
