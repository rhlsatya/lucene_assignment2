<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model ATR42-200

Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-43-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion 


The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42-200 and -300
series airplanes. The DGAC advises that cracking has been found on the hinge pins during routine overhaul of the nose
landing gear (NLG) on Model ATR42-200 and -300 series airplanes. The cause for this cracking has been attributed
to improper heat treatment during manufacture of the hinge pins. The defective pins have been isolated to those manufactured
by Nardi having part number D56867 and serial numbers beginning with the letter ``N.'' This condition, if not corrected,
could result in collapse of the NLG due to cracking of the hinge pins. 
Avions de Transport Regional has issued Service Bulletin ATR42-32-0064, dated January 17, 1994, that
describes procedures for a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect cracking in certain hinge pins of the NLG,
and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and
issued French Airworthiness Directive 94-005-055(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time dye penetrant inspection to detect
cracking in certain hinge pins in the NLG, and replacement of cracked pins with crack-free pins. The actions would
be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.

The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $330 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to various smaller transport category airplanes certificated for operation with a main deck Class B cargo compartment.
That action would have required either the conversion of all main deck Class B cargo compartments to the Class C configuration;
or the use of flame penetration-resistant containers with smoke detection and fire extinguishing systems to carry
all cargo; or the accomplishment of certain operational and equipment changes and design modifications to maximize
cargo fire detection and control. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has received
new data and is undertaking alternative rulemaking action. Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to various smaller transport category airplanes certificated for operation with a main deck Class B cargo compartment,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 5, 1990 (55 FR 36284). The proposed rule would have required either the conversion of all main deck Class
B cargo compartments to a Class C configuration; or the use of flame penetration-resistant containers with smoke
detection and fire extinguishing systems to carry all cargo; or the accomplishment of certain operational and equipment
changes and design modifications to maximize cargo fire detection and control. That action was prompted by a report
of an uncontained fire in a main deck cargo compartment on a transport category airplane. The proposed actions were
intended to prevent an uncontrolled cargo fire that could cause extensive damage to the systems and structure of the
airplane.



Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received additional data and has initiated other rulemaking activity,
which has caused it to reconsider its previous position on this rulemaking action.

The FAA received over 128 comments and suggestions to the proposal, including ones from affected operators, aircraft
manufacturers, industry representatives, and civil aviation authorities from around the world. The general nature
of almost all of the comments received was in disagreement with the issuance of the proposed rule.

One commenter requests that further action on this AD be postponed until the proposed actions have been carefully
coordinated with the aviation authorities of the countries controlling the type certificates of the applicable
aircraft. The FAA notes that, during the development of this proposal, it apprised foreign civil airworthiness authorities
(FCAA) of the planned actions. The FAA has given due consideration to the comments and recommendations that were received
from each of these FCAA's.

Many commenters question the justification for the proposed rule and request that it be withdrawn. Five commenters
question the FAA's method of requiring change via an AD. Several commenters consider that the proposed rule fails
to meet the regulatory requirements of  39.1 (``Airworthiness Directives; Applicability'') of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.1); these commenters contend that the FAA has not established that the unsafe condition
is likely to exist or develop on the affected airplanes. One commenter points out that a review of the FAA's Service
Difficulty Reports (SDR) failed to disclose any problem with regard to detection, access to, or control of smoke or
fires in baggage compartments of airplanes of the type and size affected by the proposal. One of these commenters points
out that there is no service history to suggest that compartments of this size [under 400 cubic feet] have been or are
likely to be a fire hazard. Four commenters consider that the FAA's intent in proposing the AD should instead be addressed
either as a change to affected operators' Operation Specifications or as a change to part 121 (``Certification and
Operations: Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Air Carriers and commercial Operators of Large Aircraft'') of the
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 121).

The FAA agrees with certain observations made by these commenters. The FAA has conducted a review the SDR's as well
as the United Kingdom Civil Airworthiness Authority's (CAA) World Airline Accident Summary and found no reports
of incidents or accidents caused by fire in the Class B cargo compartment of transport airplanes addressed by this
notice. The historical data that was reviewed indicates only that there has not been a cargo compartment fire in the
size of airplanes specified in the notice. However, the lack of incidents of fire does not establish that the Class
B compartment, as defined in the existing certification regulations, has appropriate safeguards if a fire were to
occur. It is this aspect that the proposed rule was meant to address.

Some commenters state that the smaller cargo compartments of the airplanes affected by this proposed AD are different
from the larger compartments on the airplanes that are affected by AD 93-07-15, amendment 39-8547
(58 FR 21243, April 20, 1993), since those compartments contain pallets and/or containers. One commenter states
that the smaller cargo compartments used in commuter service have not been established to be similar, from the standpoint
of safety, to main deck Class B compartments of larger transports; therefore, any action to address fire safety should
concentrate on large ``Combi'' cargo compartments, as in AD 93-07-15. Another commenter considers that
the fire detection problems that may exist on jumbo-jet airplanes do not have any relevance for smaller airplanes.
Another commenter states that the hazard of carrying large pallets/containers in increasingly large ``Combi''
compartments is the issue to be addressed, not the size of the compartment itself. 


The FAA disagrees that the smaller cargo compartments are not similar, with regard to fire safety, to the larger compartments
containing pallets or containers. On the smaller transport airplanes, cargo and luggage are loaded in a manner such
that smoke detection and access may be inhibited if the fire is deep-seated (buried in the cargo), much the same as in
a container or pallet on a larger transport airplane. Further, the FAA has observed, and one commenter to the notice
admitted, that in many instances, some operators of the smaller transport airplanes load the airplane's cargo compartments
in such a manner that there is no place to displace the cargo within the compartment in order to get at a fire. This presents
a two-fold hazard: 


1. The fire cannot be accessed and continues to burn; and 


2. If cargo is removed from the cargo compartment, passengers could be exposed to fire, toxic smoke, and fumes; this
situation is unsafe and contrary to the concept and rule requirements of the Class B cargo compartment. 


Four commenters provide information concerning the economic effects of the proposed AD. One of these commenters,
an operator, states that it has had a long-term investment in its combi operations; however, if the rule is issued,
any further ``Combi'' operations would be cost-prohibitive for this operator. This would force the operator to raise
passenger ticket prices, and resort to less frequent all-passenger or all-cargo flights. Another commenter states
that the proposed requirements of the rule would have a devastating effect on service to remote communities that have
no alternative means of transport available. Another commenter states that it would cost up to $200,000 per airplane
to accomplish the requirement to convert the cargo compartment to a Class C configuration; this would be a great economic
burden for small operators. Another commenter estimated that the requirements of the proposed rule would cost 10%
of its annual gross revenues. 

In light of these comments and other information provided, the FAA must continue to consider the following aspects
relevant to this rulemaking action: 


1. A service history indicating that there has not been a fire in the Class B cargo compartments of the size of aircraft
addressed by the proposed rule; and 


2. Cargo loading practices on the smaller transport category airplanes that may inhibit smoke detection and negate
access requirements of the Class B cargo compartment. 

Because of the potentially catastrophic consequences of fire in Class B cargo compartments and the impossibility
of eliminating the potential for such fires, the FAA cannot conclude that the existing Class B compartments do not
present an unsafe condition. However, this condition is a result of flaws in the underlying design standards for these
compartments, and correcting those flaws may have significant economic and operational consequences. For these
reasons, the FAA has concluded that issuance of an AD to address this condition is not warranted at this time. 

The FAA now considers that a change to part 25 (``Airworthiness Standards: Transport Category Airplanes'') of the
FAR (14 CFR part 25) and to the relevant operating regulations of the FAR to address these issues is more appropriate
and will allow further public participation in the rulemaking process. 


In 1989, just prior to the time that the notice was published, a subgroup of the Department of Transportation Task Force
on FAA Reform recommended that a Standing Advisory Committee for Rulemaking be established. The Secretary of Transportation
approved this recommendation, and the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) was chartered in 1991. The
purpose of the committee is to provide advice and recommendations to the FAA concerning the full range of the FAA's
rulemaking activity with respect to safety-related issues. The expected benefits of ARAC are to take advantage of
the industry technical expertise and experience, to resolve controversies in an open forum, to resolve issues before
formal rulemaking, and to broaden public participation in the process. 


The FAA has asked ARAC to consider 70 rulemaking issues, one of which is rulemaking relative to the Class B cargo compartment.
A ``Class B Cargo Compartment Harmonization Working Group'' was established recently to formulate and harmonize
an international position on amended requirements for the Class B cargo compartment as installed on transport category
airplanes. In its deliberations, ARAC currently is considering the safety issues related to the Class B cargo compartment,
appropriate rule requirements, necessary rule changes, estimated costs, and comments and advice from the aviation
industry. 


In light of this other on-going rulemaking activity, the FAA hereby withdraws the proposed AD. 


Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 


Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to establish a new and independent Class D airspace at Robins AFB, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full
time air traffic control tower. This notice further proposes to amend Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional
Airport, Macon, Georgia, by removing Robins AFB from the Macon, Georgia, Class D description. This notice also proposes
to establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, when the associated control tower
is closed. The intended effect of this action is to clarify when two-way communication with these air traffic control
towers is required and to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument approach procedures when the Middle Georgia
Regional Airport control tower is closed.



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Comments Invited



Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters
wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed,
stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ASO-6.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the
specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained
in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for Southern Region, Room 530, 1701 Columbia Avenue, College Park, Georgia
30337, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact
with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.


Availability of NPRM's


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Manager, System Management Branch (ASO-530), Air Traffic Division, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta,
Georgia 30320. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on
a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the
application procedure.


The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish a new
independent Class D airspace at Robins AFB, Georgia. Additionally, the FAA is proposing to amend Class D airspace
and establish Class E airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Prior to Airspace Reclassification
an Airport Traffic Area (ATA) and a control zone existed at these airports. However, Airspace Reclassification,
effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the terms ``airport traffic area'' and ``control zones,''
replacing them with the designation ``Class D airspace''. Robins AFB was incorporated in the Class D airspace for
Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia. Robins AFB has a full time control tower. However, the Macon Radar
Approach Control/Tower, which controls aircraft for the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, is part-time. The intended
effect of this proposal is to amend the Class D airspace at Middle Georgia Regional Airport by removing Robins AFB from
the Macon, Georgia Class D Airspace and designation. This notice also proposes to establish Class E surface airspace
at the Middle Georgia Regional Airport, Macon, Georgia, to provide adequate controlled airspace for instrument
approach procedures when the Macon Radar Approach Control/Tower is closed.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations for Class D and Class E
airspace are published respectively in paragraphs 5000 and 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective
September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1 effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and E airspace
designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine modifications are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1)
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On April 26, 1994, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 794 (59 FR 21698) in the 

Federal Register

. In the notice, ATF proposed to amend trade practice regulations in 27 CFR parts 6 (Tied-House), 8 (Exclusive Outlet),
10 (Commercial Bribery) and 11 (Consignment Sales) by adding standards for enforcing the ``exclusion'' element
where appropriate and by revising other regulations as the result of an agency review and an industry petition. At
this time, no final decision has been made on whether to hold public hearings and ATF continues to reserve that decision.


Extension of Comment Period


In order to allow interested persons to comment fully, the comment period, originally scheduled to close on June 27,
1994, will be extended until July 27, 1994. All written comments received will be considered in the development of
a decision on this matter. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views or suggestions presented
will be particularly helpful in developing a reasoned regulatory decision on this matter.


Correction


In notice no. 794, (93F-003P), beginning on page 21698 of the issue of Tuesday, April 26, 1994, make the following
correction:
On page 21712, in the third column, Paragraph 55, the table of contents entry for section 10.54 read, ``Criteria for

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Source Categories: Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of public hearing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The proposed standards would limit emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing commercial,
civil, and military aerospace original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and rework facilities that are major sources
of HAP emissions. A major source is defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act) as a source
that emits, or has the potential to emit, considering controls, 10 tons per year (tpy) or more of any individual HAP
or 25 tpy or more of any combination of HAP. The proposed standards implement section 112(d) of the Act, which requires
the Administrator to regulate emissions of the HAP listed in section 112(b) of the Act. Many of these pollutants are
emitted from cleaning, primer, topcoat, depainting, and chemical milling maskant operations. These operations
are being covered in the proposed rule. The intent of the proposed rule is to protect the public health by requiring
new and existing major sources to control HAP emissions to the level attainable by the maximum achievable control
technology (MACT). The EPA is also proposing Method 309 with the standards. Method 309 would be used to determine the
rolling material balance period for carbon adsorbers.


A public hearing will be held, if requested, to provide interested persons an opportunity for oral presentation of
data, views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards.

I. Background 



The Act requires, under section 112, that EPA evaluate and control emissions of HAP. The control of HAP is to be achieved
through promulgation of emission standards under sections 112(d) and (f) for categories of sources that emit HAP.
Pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act, EPA published in the 

Federal Register

 the initial list of source categories that emit HAP on July 16, 1992 (57 FR 31576). This list includes major and area
sources of HAP that the EPA intends to regulate before November of the year 2000. 

For the purposes of the proposed rule, aerospace industries refers to all facilities that manufacture aerospace
vehicles or components and all facilities that rework (including repair) these aerospace vehicles or components.
Aerospace vehicle or component is defined as any fabricated part, processed part, assembly of parts, or completed
unit of any aircraft including, but not limited to, airplanes, helicopters, missiles, rockets, and space vehicles.


Section 183(b)(3) of the Act requires the Administrator to issue control techniques guidelines (CTG) for volatile
organic compound (VOC) emissions from aerospace coatings and solvents to such levels as the Administrator determines
are achievable through adoption of best available control measures (BACM). The EPA is required to take into account
the applicable requirements of section 112 in developing the guidelines. 

The organic HAP emissions limitations described in the remainder of this notice also address the VOC emissions from
aerospace coatings and solvents. Thus, the control techniques evaluated for the MACT standard are also applicable
to VOC emissions. 

The EPA traditionally issues a draft CTG containing recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than issue
a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA is using this notice to request public comment on a draft BACM, which is the
same as the proposed MACT for coatings and solvents. Comments received on the proposed MACT rule will also be considered
in formulating a final BACM. 

The information described here will also serve to provide guidance to the States for developing VOC rules to meet other
Clean Air Act requirements. 

Certain low-usage coatings were not addressed in the NESHAP. These coatings are adhesives, sealants, and 30 specialty
coatings which represent less than 6 percent of the total HAP emissions from the industry. Also, the EPA data analyses
indicate that the MACT floor for these coatings would be no control. The EPA is requesting public comment on the need
for a separate CTG providing guidance for the control of these coatings. 



II. Summary of the Proposed Rule 



Table 1 provides an overview of the proposed rule, including applicability; the standards for each affected source;
test methods and procedures; and monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.

A. Applicability 



1. Description of the Source Category 



The proposed rule would apply to each aerospace manufacturing and rework facility that is a major source, as defined
under section 112(a) of the Act. A major source is one that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls,
9.1 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tpy) or more of any hazardous air pollutant or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of any combination
of hazardous air pollutants for all activities conducted at the facility. An aerospace facility is defined as a facility
that produces in any amount an aerospace vehicle or component, or a facility that reworks (or repairs) these vehicles
or components. Aerospace operations at any major source that conduct both aerospace and non-aerospace work would
be subject to the proposed standards, regardless of the relative proportion of aerospace and non-aerospace work
at the facility. 

While the proposed rule applies only to major sources, the EPA requests comment on whether all or some of its requirements
should be applied to non-major sources. The Agency solicits available information from state and local air pollution
control agencies and others on the nature, number and location of non-major aerospace facilities, the quantities
and types of hazardous air pollutants they emit, the impact of these emissions on health and the environment, and the
extent to which these emissions already are controlled. Comments also are requested on the economic and other impacts
that would result from applying requirements of the proposed rule to these smaller sources. 

In general, aerospace facilities are covered by the SIC codes listed in Table 2. However, facilities classified under
other SIC codes may be subject to the proposed standards if the facility meets the definition of a major source and the
definition of an aerospace facility. 

Based on information obtained through the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce_Bureau
of the Census, there are an estimated 2,869 aerospace facilities that will be subject to the proposed standards. Of
this number, 1,395 manufacture or rework commercial products, and 1,474 manufacture or rework military products.
The combined HAP emissions from these facilities are estimated to be over 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy). 
In addition to these facilities, there are numerous subcontractors that manufacture or rework aerospace vehicles
or components. The subcontractors may work directly for the 




 


OEM or rework facilities, or indirectly through first line subcontractors. Since many of these subcontractors perform
various types of work, they are often classified under non-aerospace SIC codes. Consequently, an estimate of the
number of subcontractors cannot be made. One company alone, however, employs the services of over 5,000 subcontractors.




2. Affected Sources 



The proposed rule would limit organic HAP emissions from the following sources at aerospace facilities: cleaning
operation, primer application operation, topcoat application operation, depainting operation, chemical milling
maskant application operation, and the handling and storage of waste. The proposed rule would also limit inorganic
HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and depainting operations. 

Organic HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations occur from the
evaporation of the solvent contained in the coatings. These emissions occur during the application of the coatings
on aerospace vehicles or parts, which may take place in large open areas, such as hangars, or in partially or fully enclosed
spaces, such as within spray booths. 

Organic HAP emissions from cleaning and depainting operations occur from the evaporation of the volatile portion
of the cleaning solvents or chemical strippers. Cleaning emissions are nearly always fugitive in nature and occur
at essentially every processing step. Emissions from depainting are typically fugitive in nature since the operation
is carried out within a large hangar or in open tanks.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Organic HAP emissions from waste occur from evaporation of the volatile portion of the waste while it is being handled
or stored. These emissions are fugitive in nature, occurring from each waste container. 

Inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations occur during the application of the primer
or topcoat. These inorganic HAP emissions are paint particulates, commonly referred to as ``overspray,'' that do
not adhere to the surface being coated. Like the organic HAP emissions from the operations, the emissions of the inorganic
HAP occur in large open areas, such as hangars, or in partially or fully enclosed spaces, such as within spray booths.


Inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations occur from most non-chemical methods, such as plastic media
blasting, used to strip an aerospace vehicle. (Chemical stripping techniques do not release inorganic HAP.) These
emissions occur as particulates generated during the blasting process. The operation is typically carried out within
a large hangar equipped with a ventilation system and particulate filtration device (e.g., a baghouse). The inorganic
HAP that are released from the depainting operations are primarily found in the paint being stripped, although some
stripping media may contain trace amounts of inorganic HAP. 



B. Proposed Standards for Affected Sources 



In addition to the standards for affected sources as discussed below, the proposed rule contains general standards.
The general standards stipulate that all affected sources subject to the proposed rule are also subject to, as appropriate,
 63.4,  63.5, and  63.6 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63.

1

 However, certain time frames specified in these sections have been changed in the proposed rule as follows: 





(1) All affected sources shall submit any request for an extension of compliance not later than 12 months before the
affected source's compliance date regardless of whether sources are included in emissions averaging or not, rather
than not later than 18 months before the affected source's compliance date for sources that are including emission
points in an emissions average as provided for in  63.6(i)(4)(i)(B), 

(2) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of
his/her intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance submitted under either  63.6(i)(4)
or (i)(5) within 60 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate the request, rather than notifying
the owner of his/her approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar
days as provided for in  63.6(i)(12)(i) and  63.6(i)(13)(i). In addition, if the Administrator does
not notify the owner or operator in writing of his/her intention to deny approval within 60 calendar days after receipt
of sufficient information to evaluate a request for an extension of compliance, then the request shall be considered
approved, 

(3) The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application
submitted under  63.6(i)(4)(ii) (that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make
a determination) within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after
receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted, rather than 15 calendar days as provided for in  63.6(i)(13)(i).
In addition, if the Administrator does not notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application
within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any
supplementary information that is submitted, then the information in the application or the supplementary information
is to be considered sufficient upon which to make a determination, 

(4) Each owner or operator is to be provided 30 calendar days to present additional information to the Administrator
after he/she is notified of the intended denial of a compliance extension request submitted under either  63.6(i)(4)
or  63.6(i)(5), rather than 15 calendar days as provided for in  63.6(1)(12)(iii)(B) and  63.6(i)(13)(iii)(B),


(5) Each owner or operator who has submitted an extension request application under  63.6(i)(5) is to be provided
30 calendar days to present additional information or arguments to the Administrator after he/she is notified that
the application is not complete, rather than 15 calendar days as provided for in  63.6(i)(13)(ii), and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(6) A final determination to deny any request for an extension submitted under either  63.6(i)(4) or  63.6(i)(5)
will be made within 60 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application
is complete), or within 60 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is
made, rather than 30 calendar days as provided for in  63.6(i)(12)(iv) and  63.6(i)(13)(iv). 

In addition, the proposed rule requires each owner or operator who uses a control device or equipment to control HAP
emissions to prepare an operation and maintenance plan in accordance with  63.6 of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63.

2

 In addition to the information required in  63.6, the proposed rule requires that the owner or operator of the
control device or equipment include the following information: (1) The operation and maintenance criteria for each
air pollution control device or equipment, including a standardized checklist to document the operation and maintenance
of the equipment; (2) a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions and for reporting them immediately to
supervisory personnel; and (3) procedures to be followed to ensure that equipment or process malfunctions due to
poor maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur. 





The general standards also state that an owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device or equipment not
listed in the proposed rule must submit to the Administrator for approval a description of the device, test data verifying
the performance of the device or equipment for HAP and/or VOC emissions, appropriate operating parameters that would
be monitored to establish compliance with the proposed standards, and a copy of the inspection and maintenance plan
required under  63.6 of 40 CFR part 63. 

Finally,  63.6(g) of subpart A of 40 CFR part 63 allows an owner or operator of an affected source to use alternative
means of compliance. This allows the development and use of new technology not known or not demonstrated at the time
the rule was promulgated. 

The affected sources for the proposed standards are defined as follows: (1) Each cleaning operation (all hand-wipe
cleaning operations constitute an affected source, each spray gun cleaning operation constitutes an affected source,
and all flush cleaning operations constitute an affected source); (2) each primer application operation, which
includes all primer applications at the facility; (3) each topcoat application operation, which includes all topcoat
applications at the facility; (4) each depainting operation, which includes all depainting of the outer surface
of aerospace vehicles at the facility; (5) each chemical milling maskant application operation, which includes
all chemical milling maskant applications at the facility for subsequent use in Type II chemical milling etchants;
and (6) each waste storage and handling operation, which includes all waste handling and storage at the facility.


The proposed standards also specify that HAP-containing waste that is subject to the provisions of RCRA would not
be subject to the waste handling and storage requirements of the proposed standards. The EPA included this provision
so that the proposed standards would not require less strict handling and storage of waste than the RCRA requirements.


The following paragraphs summarize the proposed standards for each affected source. 



1. Cleaning Operation 



The proposed standards for the cleaning operation, including those specific to hand-wipe, spray gun, and flush cleaning
operations, would apply to all new and existing affected sources. The proposed standards would require that all fresh
and spent cleaning solvents be stored in closed containers and that solvent-laden cloth, paper, or other material
be placed in bags or other closed containers immediately after use. The bags or containers would be required to be kept
closed at all times (except when depositing or removing material) and of such design so as to contain the vapors of the
cleaning solvent. In addition, the proposed standards would require the owner or operator to implement handling
and transfer procedures to minimize spills during filling and transferring the cleaning solvent to or from enclosed
systems, vats, waste containers, and other cleaning operation equipment that holds or stores fresh or spent cleaning
solvents. The above requirements are known collectively as housekeeping measures. 

The proposed standards for the hand-wipe cleaning operation would require the use of a cleaning solvent that conforms
to the approved composition list detailed in Table 3 or a cleaning solvent that has a vapor pressure less than or equal
to 45 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) at 20
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68
 F).

The EPA is proposing a work practice standard for the cleaning of spray guns at all new and existing affected sources.
The proposed rule would require all spray guns to be cleaned by one or more of the following methods (or their equivalent):
(1) Use of an enclosed spray gun cleaning system that is kept closed when not in use, (2) nonatomized discharge of solvent
into a waste container that is kept closed when not in use, (3) disassembly of the spray gun and cleaning in a vat that
is kept closed when not in use, and (4) atomized spray into a waste container that is fitted with a device designed to
capture atomized solvent emissions. In addition, the EPA is proposing that leaks from enclosed spray gun cleaners
be repaired as soon as practicable but no later than 15 days from when the leak is first discovered. The EPA is also proposing
a work practice standard for the flush cleaning of parts, assemblies, and components of a coating unit. Under the proposed
rule, each time a part, assembly, or component of a coating unit (with the exception of spray guns) is flush cleaned,
the spent cleaning solvent would be emptied into an enclosed container or collection system that is kept closed when
not in use. 

The following cleaning operations, which would still be required to comply with the proposed housekeeping requirements,
would be exempt from the proposed cleaning solvent composition and vapor pressure requirements: 

(1) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, or testing of components of breathing oxygen systems
that are exposed to the breathing oxygen, 

(2) Cleaning during the manufacture, assembly, installation, or testing of parts, subassemblies, or assemblies
that are exposed to strong oxidizers or reducers (e.g., nitrogen tetroxide, liquid oxygen, hydrazine), 

(3) Cleaning and surface activation prior to adhesive bonding, 

(4) Cleaning of electronics and assemblies containing electronics,

(5) Cleaning of aircraft fluid systems that are exposed to the fluid, 

(6) Cleaning of fuel cells, fuel tanks, and limited access spaces, 

(7) Surface cleaning of solar cells, coated optics, and thermal control surfaces, 

(8) Cleaning during fabrication, assembly, installation, and maintenance of upholstery, curtains, carpet, and
other textile materials used on the interior of the aircraft, 

(9) Cleaning of metallic and non-metallic materials used in honeycomb cores during the manufacture of these cores,
and cleaning of the completed cores used in the manufacture of aerospace vehicles or components, 

(10) Cleaning of polycarbonate substrates, and 

(11) Cleaning and solvent usage associated with production, research, development, quality control, and laboratory
testing. 



2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations 



The proposed standards for primer and topcoat application operations would be the same for all new and existing affected
sources. Standards are being proposed to limit organic and inorganic HAP emissions from these operations. 

a. 

Organic HAP and VOC emissions.

 The standards being proposed would limit the organic HAP emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent
organic HAP content level of 350 grams of organic HAP per liter (2.9 pounds per gallon (lb/gal)) of primer (less water)
as applied, and from topcoat application operations to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 420 grams of organic
HAP per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water) as applied. In addition to the organic HAP limits, the proposed standards
would limit VOC emissions from primer application operations to an equivalent VOC content level of 350 grams of VOC
per liter (2.9 lb/gal) of primer (less water and exempt solvents) as applied, and from topcoat application operations
to an equivalent VOC content level of 420 grams of VOC per liter (3.5 lb/gal) of topcoat (less water and exempt solvents)
as applied. Equivalent organic HAP and VOC content level means the calculated organic HAP (or VOC) content of coatings
that when multiplied by the usage of the coatings yields the amount of organic HAP (or VOC) actually emitted to the atmosphere
by the use of the coatings. Exempt solvents are those organic compounds that have been determined by the EPA to have
negligible photochemical reactivity. 

The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for topcoats do not represent
demonstrated technology for exterior commercial topcoats. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether
a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial topcoats with HAP and VOC content levels higher than
the proposed levels for topcoats. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit, including
why currently available commercial topcoats cannot be used by all sources. 

Sources would be allowed to comply with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels by one or both of the following
means: (1) Use coatings that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC levels or (2) use any combination of uncontrolled
coatings such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents of these coatings comply with the
organic HAP and VOC levels for that category (averaging of primers and topcoats together is prohibited). Averaging
between uncontrolled coatings and controlled coatings is prohibited under the proposed rule. 

Instead of complying with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content levels through compliant coatings or averaging,
the proposed standards allow the use of control devices provided each control device used for the control of organic
HAP or VOC emissions from primer or topcoat application operations has an overall control efficiency, taking into
account capture and removal efficiency, of greater than or equal to 81 percent. In addition, except for incidental
emissions that may escape from the capture system, the control device cannot be used to control only a portion of emissions
from a coating operation.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00021 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant
coatings, and on a daily basis for coatings complying by averaging. Compliance for control devices other than carbon
adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating parameter or parameters, such as temperature
for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed standard, compliance with the 81 percent
overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling material balance period. The length
of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure specified in proposed Method
309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling period is 30 days.

The EPA is also proposing an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats. The proposed standard
would require the use of flow coat, roll coat, brush coat, dip coat, electrostatic attraction, or high volume low pressure
(HVLP) spray guns other than for the exemptions listed below. All application equipment would be required to be operated
and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications at all times.

The EPA is proposing to allow other application equipment that is demonstrated to achieve emission levels equivalent
to HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. Compliance must be demonstrated by comparing the emissions generated by the
alternative application method to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic application methods under actual
production conditions. The alternative method must generate emissions less than or equal to that generated by HVLP
or electrostatic spray methods.

During the alternative application method test period, the owner or operator must ensure that the coating dried film
thickness is equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day test period. This is required to ensure that the
owner or operator does not bias the test results by applying an excessive amount of coating during the initial 90-day
period and applying a minimal amount of coating during the alternative application method test period. The EPA is
requesting comments on whether the requirements of the proposed standards are sufficient to ensure that this situation
does not occur. Specifically, comments should address whether detailed recordkeeping should also be required in
order to determine that equivalent dried film thicknesses were applied.

The EPA is proposing to exempt the following situations and operations from the proposed equipment standards for
the application of primers and topcoats, although whatever application equipment is used would still be required
to be operated and maintained according to manufacturers specifications at all times: (1) Any situation that normally
requires the use of an extension on the spray gun to properly reach limited access spaces, (2) the application of coatings
that contain fillers that adversely affect atomization with HVLP spray guns and cannot be applied by any of the specified
application techniques, (3) the application of coatings that normally have a dried film thickness of less than 0.0005
inch and cannot be applied by any of the specified application techniques, (4) the use of airbrush application methods
for stenciling, lettering, and other identification markings, and (5) touchup and repair operations.

b. 

Inorganic HAP emissions.

 The standards being proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would apply
to those operations that spray apply coatings that contain inorganic HAP (usually chromium, cadmium, and selenium).
Such operations would be required to be performed in a booth or hangar in which the air flow is directed across the part
or assembly being coated and exhausted through one or more outlets. This air stream would be required to pass through
either dry particulate filters or a waterwash system to remove the particulates before exhausting to the atmosphere.
In addition, the pressure drop across the filter or waterwash would have to be continuously monitored. If the pressure
drop moves outside of the limits specified by the manufacturer to maintain proper performance of the dry particulate
filters or waterwash system, then the operation must be shut down immediately and corrective action taken. The process
cannot resume until the pressure drop is returned to the limits specified by the manufacturer.

The EPA is requesting comments on whether pressure drop is an appropriate parameter on which to make continuous compliance
determinations with the inorganic HAP emission standards. The possibility exists that different filter or waterwash
manufacturers may specify different pressure drop limits for products with essentially the same performance. Since
the proposed standards rely on pressure drop as the basis for making compliance determinations, such a difference
would result in different requirements from one facility to another. Thus, the EPA is requesting comments specifically
on whether a standardized pressure drop limit can be established, or if another operating parameter exists on which
to make compliance determinations that would be consistent and enforceable for all types and brands of filters and
waterwash systems.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If pressure drop is selected as the parameter to be used to determine continuous compliance, then a violation of the
standards could occur under one of the following conditions: (1) Whenever the pressure drop moves outside the limits
specified by the manufacturer or (2) when the pressure drop is found to be outside the specified limits when monitored
and recorded once per operating shift. As the proposed rule is currently written, a violation would occur in the latter
situation. The EPA is requesting comments on which of these options, or another option, is most appropriate.

The EPA is proposing to exempt the following list of operations from the proposed standards for inorganic HAP emissions
from primer and topcoat application operations:

(1) Touch-up of scratched surfaces or damaged paint,
(2) Hole daubing for fasteners,
(3) Touch-up of trimmed edges,
(4) Coating prior to joining dissimilar metal components,
(5) Stencil operations performed by brush or air brush,
(6) Section joining, and
(7) Touch-up of bushings and other similar components.



3. Depainting Operation



Standards are being proposed for both organic HAP emissions and inorganic HAP emissions from depainting. With the
exception of the proposed standards for spot stripping and decal removal, as discussed below, the standards being
proposed for depainting would be the same for all new and existing affected sources. The proposed standards would
apply only to the depainting of the outer surface of entire aerospace vehicles, including the fuselage, wings, and
horizontal and vertical stabilizers of the aircraft, and the outer casing and stabilizers of missiles and rockets.
Standards for the depainting of parts, subassemblies, radomes, and parts normally removed from the completed vehicle
before depainting are not being proposed at this time. However, wings and stabilizers would always be required to
comply.

a. 

Organic HAP emissions.

 The proposed standards would require that there be no organic HAP emissions from the depainting operation. These
standards could be achieved through the use of (1) chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP or (2) media blasting
equipment, high intensity ultra-violet light blasting, or any other non-chemical depainting technique. However,
the proposed rule would allow the use of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper for spot stripping and decal removal.
The proposed rule would limit this use of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper to an average of 26 gallons per
aircraft for commercial aircraft and 50 gallons per aircraft for military aircraft, calculated on an annual basis.

Non-chemical-based depainting equipment would be required to be operated and maintained according to manufacturer's
specifications. During any period of malfunction, the owner or operator would be allowed to use a substitute material
to depaint the vehicles. Unless the substitute material does not contain any organic HAP, the substitute material
would not be allowed to be used for more than 14 consecutive days.

The proposed rule does not contain an annual limit on the number of days a source may use HAP-containing chemical strippers
during periods of malfunction of non-chemical-based depainting equipment. The EPA is requesting comments on whether
an annual limit should be imposed and, if so, technical justification for the number of days specified by the limit.

b. 

Inorganic HAP emissions.

 The proposed rule for inorganic HAP emissions would apply to those depainting methods (typically blasting methods)
that generate airborne particulate emissions, such as dust and paint particles, that contain inorganic HAP. The
proposed standards would require that the depainting operation be carried out in an enclosed hangar and that any air
stream removed from the depainting area be directed through a particulate filter (e.g., panel-type filter or baghouse)
before exhausting to the atmosphere. This filtration system must have a particulate removal efficiency greater
than or equal to 99 percent, and the pressure drop across the filter must be continuously monitored. If the pressure
drop moves outside of these limits as recorded each operational shift, then the operation must immediately be shut
down and corrective action taken. The process cannot resume until the pressure drop is within the limits specified
by the manufacturer.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As described above for primer and topcoat application operations, the EPA is requesting comments concerning the
appropriateness of using pressure drop to make compliance determinations and what action should be taken when the
pressure drop moves outside of the specified limits.



4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation



The proposed standards for the chemical milling maskant application operation would be the same for all new and existing
affected sources and applies only to those operations utilizing a Type II chemical milling etchant. The proposed
standards would limit organic HAP emissions to an equivalent organic HAP content level of 160 grams of organic HAP
per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied, and limit the VOC emissions to an equivalent
VOC content level of 160 grams of VOC per liter (1.3 lb/gal) of chemical milling maskant (less water and exempt solvents)
as applied. Alternatively, as for primer and topcoat application operations, control devices that achieve an overall
control efficiency of at least 81 percent and control all emissions (except for incidental emissions) may be used.

Compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be allowed using one or both of the following
means: (1) Use chemical milling maskants that individually comply with the organic HAP and VOC content levels or (2)
use any combination of chemical milling maskants such that the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC
content levels of these chemical milling maskants used in the chemical milling maskant operation comply with the
organic HAP and VOC content levels. Averaging uncontrolled chemical milling maskants with controlled chemical
milling maskants, however, is prohibited under the proposed rule.

Compliance with the proposed organic HAP and VOC content level standards would be shown on a monthly basis for compliant
chemical milling maskants and on a daily basis for chemical milling maskants complying by averaging. Compliance
for control devices other than carbon adsorbers would be shown on a continuous basis based on a specific operating
parameter or parameters, such as temperature for incinerators. When a carbon adsorber is used to comply with the proposed
standard, compliance with the 81 percent overall control efficiency requirement must be demonstrated for each rolling
material balance period. The length of the rolling period will vary from source to source and is determined by the procedure
specified in proposed Method 309 in the proposed rule. The minimum rolling period is one day, and the maximum rolling
period is 30 days.



5. Handling and Storage of Waste



The proposed standards for handling and storage of waste would be the same for all new and existing facilities. The
proposed rule would require that the handling and transfer of HAP-containing waste to or from containers, tanks,
vats, vessels, or piping systems be conducted in such a manner that minimizes spills. In addition, all HAP-containing
waste would be stored in closed containers.



C. Compliance Dates



The proposed rule would require all existing sources to comply no later than three years after the effective date of
the standards. In addition, the proposed rule adopts the compliance dates specified in  63.6(b) and  63.6(c)
of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.






D. Compliance Extensions



During development of the aerospace national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP), the EPA
received comments from the regulated community regarding the process that would be used to comply with the rule and
certain difficulties that were anticipated, particularly with the facilities' selection and approval of product
substitutions for coatings and hand-wipe cleaning solvents. Because of the large number of product substitutions
that may have to undergo testing and qualification at each facility, some facilities may need to request a compliance
extension.

Section 63.6(i) of 40 CFR part 63 provides the requirements for requesting an extension of compliance with a relevant
standard established under part 63.
 Specifically,  63.6(i)(4) allows the issuance of a permit granting an extension of up to one year to comply with
the standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. Section 63.6(i)(4)(i)(B)
requires requests for compliance extensions to be submitted no later than 12 months before the affected source's
compliance date.





The EPA is seeking comment on the significance of the potential difficulties of complying with the proposed aerospace
NESHAP in the allotted 3 years (or 4 years if the one-year extension described above is applied for and approved). In
addition, the EPA is seeking comment regarding how these difficulties can be addressed within the confines of the
statutory requirements of sections 112(d) and 112(i) of the Act. Specifically, the EPA is seeking comment on what
types of activities, such as technical assistance, can be provided to assist sources attempting to come into compliance
with the aerospace NESHAP.



E. Compliance Testing and Monitoring



In addition to the specific testing and monitoring requirements specified below for each affected source, the proposed
rule adopts the testing requirements specified in  63.7 of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

1. Test Methods and Procedures



a. 

Cleaning operation.

 For multi-component cleaning solvents, compliance with the proposed vapor pressure specifications would be determined
using E 260-85 to quantify the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent. The vapor pressure of
each organic compound would be determined from the manufacturer's data, standard engineering reference texts,
or other equivalent methods. The total composite vapor pressure would then be calculated by summing the partial vapor
pressure of each component according to Raoult's Law.

For single component cleaning solvents, the EPA is proposing that vapor pressure data supplied by the manufacturer
of the cleaning solvent, standard engineering reference texts, or other equivalent methods be used for compliance
determinations.

Owners or operators seeking to comply with the cleaning solvent approved composition list would have to show compliance
using data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent. The data must identify all components of the cleaning
solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met.

b. 

Primer and topcoat application operations.

 As noted earlier, the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC emissions would require compliance with an equivalent
organic HAP content level (pounds of organic HAP per gallon of coating (less water) as applied) and an equivalent VOC
content level (pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (less water and exempt solvents) as applied) for primers and for
topcoats. Compliance with these organic HAP and VOC content levels may be accomplished by using compliant coatings,
averaging between compliant and non-compliant coatings, control devices, or any combination of these methods.
In addition, the proposed standards would require the use of certain application techniques for the application
of primers and topcoats.

Test methods and procedures have been identified for compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels. No test
methods or procedures have been identified for the application equipment requirements; however, a test method has
been identified for the qualification of alternative application methods.

Method 24 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 would be used to determine the VOC content of each primer and topcoat as applied.
Alternatively, manufacturer's data may be used to determine the VOC content of these coatings. However, in the event
of any inconsistency between manufacturer's data and Method 24 test results, the Method 24 test results will take
precedence.

The facility may rely on manufacturer's data to determine the organic HAP content level of each coating. The total
organic HAP weight fraction and density of each coating as received would be determined using the manufacturer's
data. The volume of each primer and topcoat used would be determined using company records. If diluent solvents or
other ingredients are added to a primer or topcoat prior to application, then the total organic HAP and VOC weight fractions,
density, and volume must be adjusted appropriately to account for such additions. These values would be required
for each 24-hour period; however, only changes in formulation would require re-determination of total organic HAP
and VOC weight fractions and density.

The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator to calculate the volume-weighted average mass of
both VOC and organic HAP in coatings emitted per volume of coating (less water and exempt solvents for VOC; less water
for HAP) as applied. This calculation would be performed for each 24-hour period.

If an owner or operator is seeking to comply by using compliant coatings, the owner or operator would need to determine
the organic HAP content (less water as applied) and VOC content (less water and exempt solvents as applied). If no changes
in formulation as applied occurred, then a re-calculation of the organic HAP and VOC content levels would not be required.
Where compliant coatings are used, the proposed rule would require the determination of the organic HAP content using
manufacturer's data and VOC content using Method 24 or manufacturer's data.

<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If a control device is used, the proposed standards require the owner or operator to conduct an initial performance
test to demonstrate compliance with the overall control efficiency requirement of at least 81 percent. The percent
reduction achieved by a control device may be determined based either on total organic compounds (TOC) minus methane
and ethane or on total organic HAP.

For a carbon adsorber, the overall control efficiency would be determined using a mass balance. The mass balance calculation
would be made every rolling period (the length of the rolling period will vary from facility to facility and will range
from 1 to 30 days).

For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, the overall control efficiency would be based on capture efficiency
and destruction efficiency. Capture efficiency would be determined based on the procedure specified in  52.741(a)(4)(iii)
of 40 CFR subpart O, unless the operation is performed within a total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements
of a total enclosure as specified in  52.741, appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR subpart O would have a capture efficiency
of 100 percent.

The destruction efficiency of a control device other than a carbon adsorber would be determined using the following
methods. Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used for selection of the sampling sites,
and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate.
Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic
HAP at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Also, any other test methods or data that have been validated according
to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used.

The proposed standards would also allow the use of alternative application methods provided that they generate organic
HAP and VOC emissions less than or equal to the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns. The emission
levels of the alternative application method must be determined under actual production conditions. This test would
first involve determining the organic HAP and VOC emissions for the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation
of the alternative application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns
would be used. The alternative method would then be used on actual production parts or assemblies for a period of time
sufficient to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated in the initial 90-day period. Coatings used
during the test period must be the same as those used during the initial 90-day period. In addition, the dried film thickness
must be equivalent to that applied during the initial 90-day period. 

The organic HAP and VOC emissions for the period of time where the alternative method was used would then be calculated.
Where the organic HAP and VOC emissions after implementation of the alternative method are less than or equal to the
emissions for the initial 90-day period, the alternative application method is in compliance.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), in conjunction with the California Air Resources Board
(CARB), is currently developing a test protocol to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment.
This test protocol would represent an alternative method of qualifying application equipment for use under the proposed
standards. Since this test protocol is still under development, the EPA is requesting comments from those familiar
with this test protocol or any other transfer efficiency laboratory test method concerning the ability of these procedures
to accurately and repeatedly measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment. In addition, the EPA
is requesting comments on other methods that may be used to measure the transfer efficiency of spray application equipment.

c. 

Depainting. 

For the organic HAP emissions portion of the proposed standards for depainting, the only test method or procedure
that would be required is the determination of the organic HAP content of each chemical stripper. The proposed standards
would require the use of information supplied by the manufacturer to determine the organic HAP content. If the organic
HAP content of the chemical stripper cannot be determined from manufacturer's data, then the owner or operator would
submit an alternative procedure for determining the organic HAP content for approval by the Administrator.

For the annual limit on the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used for spot stripping and decal
removal, the total annual volume as applied of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper and the number of aircraft
depainted would be determined from company records. The proposed standards would then require the owner or operator
to calculate the gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per aircraft. This calculation would
be performed for each annual period.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed standards require inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations to be reduced by 99 percent using
particulate filters such as baghouses, cartridge filters, or dry filter media. The EPA is proposing the use of Method
5 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 to determine removal efficiency. The proposed standards would require retesting whenever
the particulate filter or supplier of the filter media changes, or whenever modifications are made to the emission
collection system.

d. 

Chemical Milling Maskants. 

The same basic test methods and procedures identified for primer and topcoat application operations are also being
proposed for chemical milling maskants, requiring the determination of total organic HAP weight fraction, density,
and volume of chemical milling maskants as applied. Simpler procedures are being proposed, as for primer and topcoat
application operations, to demonstrate compliance where only compliant chemical milling maskants are being used.

As for primer and topcoat application operations, any control device, including a carbon adsorber, used to control
emissions from chemical milling maskant application operations must have an overall control efficiency of at least
81 percent and must control, except for incidental emissions, all of the emissions from the maskant operation. Test
methods that would be used to determine the overall control efficiency are identical to those given previously for
primer and topcoat application operations.

e. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

No test methods are being proposed.



2. Monitoring Requirements



Monitoring is required by the proposed standards to determine whether a source is in continuous compliance. This
can be accomplished by continuously measuring site-specific operating parameters, the values of which are established
by the owner or operator during the initial compliance test. The operating parameter value is defined as the minimum
or maximum value established for a control device or process parameter that, if achieved by itself or in combination
with other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator is complying with the applicable emission
limitation or standards. This type of enhanced monitoring would be required for those emission points for which the
standards are expressed as a percent control. In addition, the owner or operator is expected to install and operate
the equipment properly. For owners or operators complying with the proposed standards for spray gun cleaning through
the use of enclosed spray gun cleaners, compliance would be demonstrated through recordkeeping (see section II.F).

The proposed rule would require temperature to be monitored, using a continuous recorder, for incinerators. For
catalytic incinerators, temperature monitors would be placed immediately before and after the catalyst bed. For
other incinerators, the temperature monitor would be placed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream
of the firebox and before any substantial heat exchange occurs. All monitoring equipment would be installed, calibrated,
maintained, and operated according to manufacturer's specifications.

Section 63.6(g) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, allows an owner or operator of an affected source to request the use of alternative
methods of emission reduction for complying with design, equipment, work practice, or operational emission standards,
or combination thereof, established under this part.

6

 Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator of an affected source may also use control devices other than those specifically
identified in the proposed rule as a means for achieving compliance with any portion of the rule. If devices other than
those identified are used, the proposed standards would require the owner or operator to submit the parameters to
be monitored to the Administrator for approval.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed standards would require each owner or operator to establish a range of values for each of these monitored
parameters during the initial performance test. As long as the control device is operated within the established
ranges, the proposed emission standards are considered to be met. Consequently, exceedances of these parameters
would be considered a violation of the standards since operating the control device outside of the parameters may
reduce the efficiency of the control device. 

a. 

Cleaning operations. 

The proposed rule would require enclosed spray gun cleaners to be visually inspected at least once per month for leaks.
The inspections would occur while the enclosed cleaner is in operation. 

b. 

Primer and topcoat application operations. 

Where an incinerator or other control device is used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions from primer and topcoat
application operations, the monitoring requirements specified above would be required. 

For control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, the proposed standards would
require that the pressure drop across the particulate filters or waterwash be monitored on a continuous basis. 

c. 

Depainting.

 No monitoring requirements for organic HAP emissions are being proposed. For inorganic HAP emissions, continuous
monitoring of the pressure drop across the filter, as for primers and topcoats, is being proposed. 

d. 

Chemical milling maskant application operations. 

Where a control device is used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions from chemical milling maskant application
operations, the monitoring requirements specified above would be required. 

e. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

No monitoring requirements are being proposed. 



F. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements 



The proposed rule proposes to adopt the requirements contained in  63.9 (a) through (e) and  63.9 (h) through
(j) and  63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A.

7

 The proposed rule, however, contains additional or clarifying elements and changes certain time periods allowed
for submitting or responding to certain reports and requests required in  63.10. These elements and changes
are summarized below for each of the operations for which standards are being proposed. 




1. Recordkeeping Requirements 



a. 

Cleaning operations. 

For each cleaning solvent used at the facility, the proposed rule would require a record of the name of the cleaning
solvent and documentation that shows the organic HAP constituents of the cleaning solvent. For each cleaning solvent
used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that conforms to the approved composition list, the records that would be maintained
are the name of each cleaning solvent, documentation demonstrating compliance to the approved composition list,
and annual purchasing records showing the annual volume purchased of each. For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe
cleaning operations that does not conform to the approved composition list but does conform to the vapor pressure
requirement, the information required to be recorded would be the name of each cleaning solvent, the monthly usage
of the cleaning solvent at each operation, the composite vapor pressure, the manufacturer's data sheets or other
documentation of the vapor pressure, and any test reports and calculations performed to determine the composite
vapor pressure. 

For cleaning solvents that do not conform to either the composition or vapor pressure requirements and are used for
the exempt cleaning operations, daily records must be maintained of the name and volume of each cleaning solvent at
each operation at which it is used, and the parts, assemblies, or subassemblies cleaned at these operations. 

In addition, a record of all leaks from spray gun cleaners would be kept, including source identification, the date
that the leak was discovered, and the date that the leak was repaired.

b. 

Primer and topcoat application operations. 

For all primers and topcoats used at the facility, records must be maintained of the name of each primer and topcoat
and its organic HAP and VOC content as received. In addition, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping
requirements depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are met. For primers or topcoats that are individually
compliant with the organic HAP and VOC content limits, records would be required of the organic HAP and VOC content
as applied, all data, calculations, and test results (including Method 24 results taken during an enforcement inspection)
used in determining the organic HAP and VOC contents as applied, and the monthly usage of each coating formulation
within each coating category. 

If averaging among compliant and non-compliant coatings is used to achieve compliance, then the proposed standards
would require that up-to-date records of daily volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP and VOC contained in the
coatings as applied be maintained. This information would include all data and calculations used in determining
these daily values, such as manufacturer's data certifying the organic HAP content of each coating as applied and
Method 24 test results (including those taken during an enforcement inspection) or manufacturer's data that show
the VOC content as applied. 

If a control device is used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content limit for primers or topcoats, up-to-date records
must be kept on the control device. Each owner or operator would be required to keep records of the equipment monitoring
parameter measurements specified in the proposed rule. For an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, continuous
records must be maintained of the firebox temperature (or temperature in the ductwork immediately downstream of
the firebox). For a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the gas stream temperature immediately
before and after the catalyst bed. For both types of incinerators, records must be maintained of the overall control
efficiency and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. 

For carbon adsorbers, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency, all test results, data, and calculations
used in determining the overall control efficiency, and the length of the rolling material balance period and all
of its supporting data and calculations used to determine the rolling period. 

For inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations, either particulate filters or waterwash
spray booths would be used to achieve compliance. Records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended limits
for the pressure drop and readings of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash that are taken once each shift
during which the coating processes are in operation. 

c. 

Depainting operation. 

Each owner or operator of a depainting operation would be required to keep up-to-date records of the name of each chemical
stripper used, the organic HAP content of each stripper and its supporting documentation, and the monthly volume
usage of each chemical stripper that contains organic HAP. 

For non-chemical depainting methods, such as media blasting, owners and operators would be required to maintain
records of the type of non-chemical-based equipment used and a description of any malfunctions that occur. If a malfunction
occurs, the information to be kept would be the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used
to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed standards for depainting contains exemptions for parts stripping, spot stripping, and decal removal,
each of which requires certain records to be maintained. For parts stripping, records must be maintained for each
model of aerospace vehicle of the parts normally removed from the vehicle. For spot stripping and decal removal, annual
records must be maintained of the number of aircraft stripped, the volume of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper
used for spot stripping and decal removal, the average number of gallons of organic HAP-containing stripper used
per aircraft, and all supporting data and calculations. 


For inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations, either particulate filters or baghouses (equipped with
either bag or cartridge filter media) would be used to achieve compliance. Records must be maintained of the filter
manufacturer's recommended pressure drop limits and the readings of the pressure drop across the filter taken once
each shift during which the depainting process is in operation. Also, records must be maintained of the particulate
control efficiency of each filter and all test results, data, and calculations used to determine the control efficiency.



d. 

Chemical milling maskant application operation. 

The EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content
levels are being met. For chemical milling maskants that are individually compliant with the organic HAP and VOC content
levels, records of the volume-weighted average masses of organic HAP and VOC emitted as applied must be kept. In addition,
all data and calculations used to determine these values and the monthly volume of each chemical milling maskant formulation
used each month must be maintained. 


If averaging among compliant and non-compliant chemical milling maskants is used to achieve compliance, then the
proposed standards would require that up-to-date records of daily volume-weighted average mass of organic HAP and
VOC contained in the chemical milling maskants as applied be maintained. This information would include all data
and calculations used in determining these daily values, such as formulation data and Method 24 test results. 


As for primer and topcoat application operations, if a control device is used, up-to-date records must be kept on the
control device. Each owner or operator would be required to keep records of the equipment monitoring parameter measurements
specified in the proposed rule. For an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be
maintained of the firebox temperature (or temperature in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox). For
a catalytic incinerator, continuous records must be maintained of the gas stream temperature immediately before
and after the catalyst bed. For both types of incinerators, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency
and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the overall control efficiency. 


For carbon adsorbers, records must be maintained of the overall control efficiency, all test results, data, and calculations
used in determining the overall control efficiency, and the length of the rolling material balance period and all
of its supporting data and calculations used to determine the rolling period. 


e. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

Each owner or operator would be required under the proposed standards to keep an up-to-date record of each waste stream
generated at the facility, identification of which wastes are subject to RCRA and which are not, and documentation
supporting those determinations. 




2. Reporting Requirements 




The proposed rule would require four basic types of reports: (1) Initial notification, (2) notification of compliance
status, (3) periodic reports, and (4) other reports. In addition, the proposed rule would require that the results
of any performance test required under  63.7 of the General Provisions to 40 CFR part 63, subpart A, be reported
no later than 30 days after the completion of the test.

8

 A permit application as required under 40 CFR part 70 may be used in lieu of the initial notification provided the same
information is contained in the permit application as required for the initial notification. 




As stated above, the proposed standards adopt the reporting requirements contained in  63.9(a) through  63.9(e)
and  63.9(h) through  63.9(j) and 63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. However, the
time period allowed for the Administrator to notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of
the request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline submitted under  63.9(i) has
been changed to within 30 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request, rather than
15 calendar days as provided for in  63.9(i)(3). 


Sections 40 CFR 63.9 and 63.10 of the General Provisions identify the type of generic information to be included in
the initial notification, notification of compliance status, and other reports and, therefore, this information
is not repeated in this preamble. The following paragraphs summarize the additional information specific to the
aerospace rule that should be included in the notification of compliance status and the type of information to be included
in the periodic reports.

a. 

Cleaning operation. 

The notification of compliance status should include an identification of each cleaning solvent used at the facility,
a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that bags and containers are kept closed when not in use and that
cleaning solvents are stored in closed containers, the name of each cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved
composition list, and the vapor pressure test results of each. 


Specific to spray gun cleaning, the notification of compliance status should also contain a detailed description
of all methods used to clean spray guns and an explanation as to how each cleaning method complies with the proposed
standards. 


Information to be included in the semiannual report covers all noncompliance situations such as using a hand-wipe
cleaning solvent that does not conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure requirements used in a non-exempt
operation. In addition, the semiannual report includes information on new cleaning solvents used for hand-wipe
cleaning in the previous six months, as well as previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use. The information
to be provided is a list of any new cleaning solvents used in the previous six months, a list of new non-HAP cleaning solvents,
if any, used, and, for new cleaning solvents used in hand-wipe cleaning operations, the composite vapor pressure
of each. 


If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring
every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with
the applicable standards. 


b. 

Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. 

For primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations, the notification of compliance status
should identify the combination of compliant coatings, averaging, and control devices that were used to demonstrate
that the facility was in compliance, and, for control devices, what operating parameters were identified for continuous
monitoring in order to ensure continuous compliance with the proposed standards. 


Owners and operators complying with the organic HAP and VOC content levels for primer, topcoat, and chemical milling
maskant application operations would be required to report each exceedance of the organic HAP or VOC content level,
as well as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across
the filters or waterwash was out of range. These reports would be submitted on a semiannual basis. 



If control devices are used, semiannual reports would be required that contain information on all days when the average
values of the parameters required to be monitored were outside the ranges established in the operating permit. 


For incinerators, this would be whenever each 3-hour average temperature was below the average temperature established
during the most recent performance test during which compliance was demonstrated. 


If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility
has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat application operations would also identify the
number of times, if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded. 


c. 

Depainting operation. 

The notification of compliance status for depainting operations should identify each chemical stripper used at
the facility to depaint aerospace vehicles and the organic HAP content of each. Each chemical stripper that contains
organic HAP and is used for decal removal, depainting of parts, and spot stripping would also be identified. In addition,
the types of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques used at the facility and the manufacturer's recommended
pressure drop across the filters for the particulate removal system, if applicable, would be identified. Finally,
each owner or operator would be required to describe the depainting methods to be used during periods of malfunction
of the non-chemical depainting methods. 


Information to be included in the semiannual report would include the name of any new chemical strippers used during
the previous six months and the organic HAP content of each. For each chemical stripper used for depainting operations
that undergoes reformulation, its organic HAP content after reformulation would be submitted with the semiannual
report. The report would also be required if the owner or operator used any new non-chemical depainting technique
at the facility since the initial report or any subsequent semiannual report. The semiannual report would be required
to identify each 24-hour period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation except from the exempt
operations, any periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods and techniques, and any periods where
the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the filters was
out of range. For each malfunction that occurs, the following information would be reported: (1) The piece of equipment
that malfunctioned, (2) the date the malfunction occurred and the date it was corrected, (3) a description of the malfunction,
(4) the alternate methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the malfunction period, and (5) the dates
that these methods were begun and discontinued. 


Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility
and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft
depainted. 


For spot stripping and decal removal, an annual report would be required whenever the average volume per aircraft
of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used exceeds the limits specified in the proposed rule for the annual
period. 


If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required every
12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the depainting operation has been in compliance with the
applicable standards. This annual report would also detail how many times the pressure drop limits for each filter
system were exceeded and report when the calculated annual average volume of organic HAP-containing strippers used
per aircraft for spot stripping and decal removal exceeded the applicable limits. 


d. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

The notification of compliance status would identify each waste stream and identify whether it is RCRA or non-RCRA
regulated. The notification would also include a description of the procedures to be used to ensure that spills are
minimized during handling and transfer operations. Also included would be the procedures to be used to ensure that
waste is stored in closed containers.

<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Semiannual reports are required to identify any waste stream whose RCRA or non-RCRA classification has changed.
The semiannual report would also identify any new waste streams and whether each is RCRA or non-RCRA regulated. An
annual report would be required if no changes occurred in the RCRA status to the existing waste streams and if no new
waste streams were generated. 



III. Summary of Environmental, Energy, and Economic Impacts of the Proposed Standards 



A. Emission Reductions 



1. Existing Facilities 



For the existing aerospace OEM and rework facilities (approximately 2,869 facilities in the base year 1991), the
nationwide baseline HAP emissions are estimated to be 189,000 Mg/yr (208,000 tpy). Implementation of the proposed
regulation would reduce these emissions by approximately 112,600 Mg/yr (123,700 tpy), or 59 percent. 



2. New Facilities 



For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net emission reduction
due to new facilities is anticipated during this period. 



B. Secondary Environmental Impacts 



Secondary environmental impacts are considered to be any air, water, or solid waste impacts, positive or negative,
associated with the implementation of the proposed standards. These impacts are exclusive of the direct air emission
reductions discussed in the previous section. All of the impacts discussed below reflect the maximum increase or
decrease, as appropriate, that would occur if all of the affected sources converted to the control option described.


Some product reformulations that may be used to comply with the proposed standards for hand-wipe cleaning, primers,
and topcoats may contain organic HAP or VOC not present in the original product. In these cases, different organic
HAP or VOC may be emitted as a result of the proposed rule, but the overall level of these compounds that are emitted will
decrease. Chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP used for depainting may result in increased VOC emissions
when used to replace methylene chloride-based chemical strippers (methylene chloride is a HAP, but not a VOC). 

There is a potential for an impact on water quality resulting from some of the prescribed control measures. Under baseline
conditions for chemical milling maskant operations, no wastewater is generated; however, some of the sources may
install a carbon adsorber to control solvent emissions. If all affected sources use carbon adsorbers, the amount
of water needed to create regenerating steam for these systems, which will add to the wastewater burden from these
sources, is estimated to be 447 million gallons per year nationwide. For depainting operations, there are two options
available for meeting the proposed rule, both of which will result in a decrease in the amount of wastewater generated
compared to baseline, which is 251 million gallons per year. The decrease in wastewater nationwide is estimated to
be 251 million gallons and 86 million gallons if all affected sources use dry media blasting or chemical strippers
that do not contain organic HAP, respectively. 

Sources installing a carbon adsorption system on their chemical milling maskant operations would generate additional
solid waste due to the necessity of periodically disposing of spent activated carbon. If all affected sources use
carbon adsorbers, this added nationwide solid waste burden is estimated to be 4,500 tons per year, compared to the
baseline of 21,200 tons per year. Rework facilities that presently use a methylene chloride-based paint stripper
must dispose of 3,469 tons per year of paint/solvent sludge created by depainting. A total conversion to dry media
paint removal would produce an increase in the amount of solid waste composed of dry paint chips and spent blasting
media. This increase in solid waste is estimated to be 13,280 tons per year on a nationwide basis. The proposed standards
for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would result in the increase
in solid waste generation from the disposal of used dry filter media. The increased solid waste burden is estimated
to be 640 tons per year, compared to the baseline solid waste generation of 3,540 tons per year.

C. Energy Impacts 



Some of the control measures proposed for aerospace manufacturing and rework operations would lead to increases
in energy consumption. Both of the control options for chemical milling maskant operations, operation of a carbon
adsorber or conversion to waterborne chemical milling maskant, would involve increased electricity usage (waterborne
chemical milling maskants must be cured at elevated temperatures). The total additional energy needed if all affected
sources operate new carbon adsorbers is estimated to be 1.7 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, and the energy
increase for all affected sources to operate new curing ovens for waterborne chemical milling maskants is estimated
at 324,700 kWh per year. Baseline energy consumption for chemical milling maskant operations is considered to be
negligible since the use of solvent-based chemical milling maskants does not directly require the use of electricity.


The dry media paint removal systems that would be installed at rework facilities consume additional energy compared
to the solvent stripping method. Baseline energy consumption for solvent stripping is considered to be negligible
since the use of these strippers does not directly require the use of electricity. The increase in energy consumption
involved in operating dry media blasting systems is estimated to be 51 million kWh per year. The use of chemical strippers
that do not contain organic HAP is essentially the same as the baseline solvent stripping operation; therefore, no
energy impact will result from their use. 

The proposed standards for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations
would require some facilities to install additional spray booths. These spray booths, whether equipped with dry
filters or waterwash, will increase the energy consumption of the affected sources. This increase in energy consumption
is estimated to be 5.9 million kWh per year, compared to the baseline energy consumption of 117.4 million kWh per year.




D. Cost Impacts 



The total capital and annualized control costs (1992 dollars), including recovery credits, attributable to compliance
with the proposed standards have been estimated for both existing and new facilities. The following two subsections
summarize the results of this cost analysis. 



1. Existing Facilities 



a. 

Capital costs.

 Capital costs would be incurred with the implementation of control measures for chemical milling maskants (both
solvent-based chemical milling maskants with a carbon adsorber and waterborne chemical milling maskants), dry
media blasting for depainting, spray gun cleaning, and control of HAP emissions from primer, topcoat, and depainting
operations. With the exception of dry media blasting for depainting, the nationwide capital costs listed below represent
the maximum costs that would be incurred assuming that all facilities implemented the specific control option. For
dry media blasting, it is not reasonable to assume that all commercial and military rework facilities (a total of 2,026
facilities) depaint the outer surface of aerospace vehicles. Therefore, it was assumed that only 5 percent of the
small and medium size rework facilities and all of the large rework facilities perform outer surface depainting.


For carbon adsorbers used in conjunction with solvent-based chemical milling maskants, the nationwide capital
cost is estimated to be $500 million, and for waterborne chemical milling maskants it is estimated to be $289 million.
The implementation of dry media blasting systems for depainting would require a nationwide capital cost of $61 million.
It should be noted that other control measures exist for depainting other than dry media blasting, such as chemical
strippers that do not contain organic HAP, that require no capital investment. Selection of chemical strippers that
do not contain organic HAP by all affected sources instead of dry media blasting would decrease the total nationwide
capital investment by approximately 10 percent. The proposed rule would also require capital costs for high transfer
efficiency application equipment and spray gun cleaning equipment totalling $130 million and $10 million, respectively.
The control of inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations would require the installation
of spray booths and filter systems at a capital cost of $13 million.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Total nationwide capital costs range from $503 million to $714 million, depending on which chemical milling maskant
control option is used.

b. 

Annual costs.

 All of the control options will result in some annual costs being incurred by the affected sources. However, the annualized
cost figures presented below reflect the net cost to implement the control options after taking into account the costs
that would have been incurred for baseline. This net cost (MACT cost minus baseline cost) resulted in net annual savings
for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods; spray gun cleaning; and the use of chemical
strippers that do not contain organic HAP. All other options resulted in net annual costs to the affected sources.
The net cost (or savings) for all control options reflects the maximum cost (or savings) that would be incurred assuming
all affected sources implemented the specific control option.

Only one cost analysis was completed for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods due
to the interrelationship between these operations. For example, high transfer efficiency application methods
will result in a lower volume of primers and topcoats being applied. In addition, the organic HAP and VOC limits on primers
and topcoats will, due to higher solids content, also result in a lower volume of the coatings being applied. The reduction
in coating usage due to the lower organic HAP and VOC content had to be taken into account first, then the reduction in
coating usage due to high transfer efficiency application methods was applied to this reduced coating volume to obtain
the true overall reduction in coating usage. After factoring in the annualized cost of the coating equipment, the
analysis showed a nationwide savings of $71 million for commercial sources and $18 million for military sources.

The savings for primers, topcoats, and high transfer efficiency application methods are due primarily to labor savings
that would result from the reduced volume of coatings to be applied. For example, if it would have taken 15 gallons of
primer under baseline conditions to coat an aircraft and only 12 gallons under MACT conditions, then the cost analysis
assumes a labor savings for the 3 gallons of primer that were not applied. The EPA has received some evidence, however,
that the labor stays the same or may even increase with the use of high transfer efficiency application methods (specifically
HVLP spray guns). The EPA requests comments from facilities that have converted from conventional spray guns to HVLP
spray guns regarding the labor hours per gallon of coating applied for each application method.

For spray gun cleaning, the proposed standards would result in a nationwide savings of approximately $56 million.
This is due primarily to reduced solvent usage and associated spent solvent disposal.

The use of chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP would result in a nationwide savings of approximately
$2 million. While the cost of non-HAP strippers is generally higher than the cost of conventional strippers, this
cost is offset by the reduced disposal costs incurred with non-HAP strippers. Since non-HAP strippers do not contain
methylene chloride, they can typically be treated on-site. This eliminates the disposal costs incurred with the
conventional strippers, which are typically shipped off-site for disposal.

Nationwide annual costs are estimated to be $14 million for hand-wipe and flush cleaning, $111 million for waterborne
chemical milling maskants, $2 million for inorganic HAP emissions from primer and topcoat application operations,
and $0.3 million for inorganic HAP emissions from blast depainting operations.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00034 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Total nationwide costs, taking into account both the savings and costs detailed above, are estimated to be a savings
of $20 million.

Sources subject to the proposed rule would be required to perform certain monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting
tasks. These information collection requirements will create a burden on the affected sources in terms of resources
needed to comply with these requirements (see section VI.D.). The total nationwide costs of the manpower requirements
to complete these tasks are estimated to be $36.7 million.

Total nationwide costs are estimated to be $16.7 million, which is the sum of the annualized costs (a total nationwide
savings of $20 million) and the costs due to monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements (a total nationwide
cost of $36.7 million).



2. New Facilities



For the aerospace industry, no net growth is expected over the next five years; therefore, no net costs (or savings)
due to new facilities are anticipated during this period.



E. Economic Impacts



Due to the low total compliance costs associated with the proposed regulation, the discussion of the economic impacts
is presented in a qualitative manner. The low costs of the proposed regulation are in a large part due to cost savings
expected to be achieved by some model plants. The economic impact analysis discussed in a qualitative manner the primary
impacts (the direction of price and output changes in the aerospace industry), as well as secondary impacts (the direction
of changes in the demands for inputs such as coatings) associated with the proposed regulation.

Cost estimates indicate that the total annual compliance costs are approximately $16.7 million. In 1990, revenue
for this industry equalled approximately $118.9 billion. Using revenue data as a proxy for production costs, the
costs of the proposed regulation are only 0.01 percent of the total production costs for the industry. This increase
in production cost is expected to have minimal impact on the current prices and outputs of the aerospace industry.

Secondary impacts refer to changes in factor demand by all aerospace producers. For example, while the primary impact
of the regulation on spray gun cleaning is a decrease in the cost of performing this task, the actual cause of the decrease
in the cost is a reduction in the use of methyl ethyl ketone and other solvents. Although compliance with the proposed
regulation is expected to reduce consumption of coatings and solvents in general and, therefore, negatively impact
the producers of these products, compliance with the proposed regulation is also expected to increase product substitution
so that demand for non-HAP strippers, waterborne maskants, and low vapor pressure solvents will increase. Lack of
economic data on a product-specific basis prevents quantification of the indicated impacts.



IV. Process Descriptions and Control Technologies



A. Process Descriptions



Aerospace manufacturing and rework operations consist of the following basic operations: Chemical milling maskant
application, chemical milling, adhesive bonding, cleaning (e.g., hand-wipe, spray equipment, and flush), metal
finishing, electrodeposition, coating application (e.g., primers, topcoats, sealants, and specialty coatings),
depainting, and composite processing. In addition, most aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities generate
waste and wastewater, and some facilities have storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. An aerospace facility
may conduct all of these processes in its operations, such as an OEM facility that produces the entire aircraft. However,
an aerospace facility may conduct only a subset of these operations, such as a facility that produces a single component
or assembly, or a facility that provides a service such as chemical milling.



1. Chemical Milling Maskant Application and Chemical Milling



Chemical milling uses etchant solutions to reduce the thickness of selected areas of metal parts in order to reduce
weight. The process is typically used when the size or shape of the part precludes mechanical milling or when chemical
milling is advantageous due to shorter processing time or its batch capability.

Chemical milling maskants are typically rubber- or polymeric-based coatings applied to an entire part or subassembly
by brushing, dipping, spraying, or flow coating. After the chemical milling maskant is cured, it is removed from selected
areas of the part where metal is to be removed during the chemical milling process. The chemical milling maskant remaining
on the part protects those areas from the etchant solution. Chemical milling maskants typically contain either a
toluene/xylene mixture or perchloroethylene as its solvent constituents.

<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Organic HAP emissions occur through evaporation of the solvent as the chemical milling maskant is applied and while
it cures. 


2. Adhesive Bonding (Adhesives and Adhesive Bonding Primers) 


Adhesive bonding involves the joining together of two or more metal parts, such as the parts of a honeycomb core. This
process is typically performed when the joints being formed are essential to the structural integrity of the aircraft.
The surfaces to be bonded are first coated with an adhesive bonding primer to promote adhesion and protect from subsequent
corrosion. Structural adhesives are applied as either a thin film or as a paste, and can be oven cured or cured in an autoclave.
Organic HAP emissions occur from the evaporation of solvents contained in the adhesive bonding primer and adhesive
during their application, as well as during the curing step. 


3. Cleaning Operations 


a. 

Hand-wipe and flush cleaning.

 Aerospace components are cleaned frequently during manufacturing to remove contaminants such as dirt, grease,
and oil, and to prepare the components for the next operation. Cleaning is typically performed by a hand wiping process
using a wide variety of cleaning solvents. Assemblies and parts with concealed or inaccessible areas may be flush
cleaned by pouring the cleaning solvent over or into the part. The cleaning solvent is then drained from the part and
the procedure is repeated as many times as necessary to ensure the required cleanliness. 
Organic HAP emissions from hand-wipe and flush cleaning operations occur from the evaporation of cleaning solvents
during the cleaning process, including evaporation of the solvent from open containers and from solvent-soaked
cloth and paper. Organic HAP emissions also occur from storage tanks used to store cleaning solvents. 
b. 

Spray gun cleaning.

 Spray guns and other components of coating units must be cleaned when switching from one coating to another and when
they are not going to be immediately reused. The cleaning of spray guns can be performed either manually or with enclosed
spray gun cleaners. Manual cleaning involves disassembling the gun and placing the parts in a vat containing an appropriate
cleaning solvent. The residual paint is brushed or wiped off the parts. After reassembling, the cleaning solvent
may be sprayed through the gun for a final cleaning. 
Enclosed spray gun cleaners are self-contained units that pump the cleaning solvent through the gun within a closed
chamber. After the cleaning cycle is complete, the guns are removed from the chamber and typically undergo some manual
cleaning to remove coating residue from areas not exposed to the cleaning solvent, such as the seals under the atomizing
cap. 
Organic HAP emissions from spray gun cleaning occur from the evaporation of cleaning solvents during the cleaning
cycle, such as while hand cleaning the guns in an open vat. Organic HAP emissions also occur from enclosed spray gun
cleaners when they are opened to remove the guns. 


4. Metal Finishing and Electrodeposition 


Metal finishing processes are used to prepare the surface of a part for better adhesion, improved surface hardness,
and improved corrosion resistance. Typical metal finishing operations include conversion coating, anodizing,
desmutting, descaling, and any operation that chemically affects the surface layer of a part.

<TEXT>
 

Electrodeposition, or metal plating, is an additive process for metal substrates in which another metal layer is
added to the substrate in order to enhance corrosion and wear resistance necessary for the successful performance
of the component. The two types of electrodeposition typically used are electroplating and plasma arc spraying.

HAP emissions from metal finishing operations occur in the form of gases or vapors that evaporate from the surface
of processing solutions. Evaporation of solution also occurs from the parts as they are removed from the processing
tanks. 


5. Coating Application 


A coating is a material that is applied to the surface of a part to form a decorative or functional solid film. The most
common coatings are the broad categories of non-specialized primers and topcoats. There are also numerous specialty
coatings ranging from temporary protective coatings to radiation effect coatings designed to shield aircraft from
radar detection. 
Coatings are applied to aerospace vehicles and components using several methods of application. The methods most
commonly used are spraying, brushing, rolling, flow coating, and dipping. Spray application systems include conventional
air spray, airless spray, air-assisted airless, electrostatic, and high volume low pressure (HVLP) spray. These
latter two methods are generally accepted as having better transfer efficiency than other spraying methods and are
gaining increased use as a means of using less coating and, hence, reducing emissions. 
Nearly all aerospace coatings contain a mixture of organic solvents. Organic HAP emissions from coating application
occur from the evaporation of the solvents during mixing, application, and drying. Inorganic HAP emissions of metal
compounds (e.g., chromium and cadmium) also occur from overspray, which is exhausted from spray booths or paint spray
hangars. 


6. Depainting 


The depainting operation involves the removal of coatings from the outer surface of aircraft. The two basic depainting
methods are chemical depainting and blast depainting. Chemical depainting agents are applied to the aircraft, allowed
to degrade the coating, and then scraped or washed off with the coating residue. Blast depainting methods utilize
a media such as plastic, wheat starch, carbon dioxide, or high pressure water to remove coatings by physically abrading
the coatings from the surface of the aircraft. 
Organic HAP emissions from chemical depainting occur from evaporation of the solvents in the stripping solution.
The amount of emissions from the process is directly related to the surface area being stripped, the type and thickness
of coating to be removed, and the effectiveness of the stripper. Inorganic HAP emissions occur from the various blast
depainting methods. The inorganic HAP are contained in the coatings being removed (trace amounts of inorganic HAP
may also be found in some blast media) and are emitted as particulates. 


7. Composite Processing 


Composite processing consists of seven basic operations: Layup, thermal forming, debulking, curing, break-out,
compression molding, and injection molding. Layup is the process of assembling the layers of the composite structure
by positioning composite material in a mold and impregnating the material with a resin. Thermal forming is the process
of forming the layup in a mold, which usually takes place in an autoclave. During the thermal forming process, debulking
also may occur, which is the simultaneous application of low-level heat and pressure to the composite structure to
force out excess resin, trapped air, vapor, and volatiles from between the layers of the composite structure. The
curing step, which is the process of changing the resin into a solid material through a polymerization reaction, also
occurs in the autoclave. After curing and removal from the autoclave, the break-out process removes the composite
structure from the molds or curing fixtures. 
Two other methods of forming composite structures are compression molding and injection molding. Compression molding
is the process of filling one half of a mold with a molding compound, closing the mold, and applying heat and pressure
until the material is cured. Injection molding uses a closed mold, where the molding compound is injected into the
mold, maintained under pressure, and then cured by applying heat. 
Organic HAP emissions from composite processing occur from volatilization of a small portion of the solvent components
during curing, because the majority of these solvents are consumed in the curing reaction of the resin. 


8. Wastewater 


Nearly every aerospace manufacturing and rework operation has the potential to generate wastewater. For example,
metal finishing operations use water to rinse parts after each processing step. These rinse steps are typically carried
out in large tanks with either a continuous or intermittent water flow. The wastewater generated is usually treated
to some extent at the facility, then discharged.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00037 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

HAP emissions from wastewater result from the evaporation of volatile components in the water. Evaporation may occur
in open trenches, storage tanks, and treatment operations. 


9. Handling and Storage of Waste 


Waste is produced primarily from cleaning, coating, and depainting operations. Cleaning operations produce solvent
laden cloth and paper and spent solvent which can emit organic HAP from the evaporation of the solvents. Coating operations
produce waste paint and waste solvent thinner that also emit organic HAP through evaporation. Depainting operations
can produce either a liquid or solid waste stream depending on the type of process used. Chemical depainting processes
produce a liquid sludge that consists of the stripper solution and paint residue. Emissions occur from the evaporation
of the solvent from the stripper solution. Blast depainting processes produce a solid waste stream that consists
of paint chips and spent blasting media. Emissions do not directly occur from this waste stream, although particulate
emissions are generated during the blasting process. 


10. Storage of Hand-Wipe Cleaning Solvents


Many large aerospace facilities use storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. According to data obtained through
responses to EPA questionnaires under section 114 of the Act (section 114 questionnaires), these tanks are primarily
above ground, fixed-roof type ranging in size from 350 to 6800 gallons in size. Emissions from these tanks occur from
evaporation of the cleaning solvents, as well as breathing and working losses. 


B. Control Techniques 


The principal techniques used by the aerospace industry to control organic HAP emissions are preventative measures
and control devices. For the control of inorganic emissions, control devices such as filters and waterwash are used.
Preventative measures are any action, product modification, process modification, or equipment change designed
to eliminate or reduce the generation of emissions. Control devices do not prevent the generation of emissions, but
rather capture or destroy the emissions generated by a source. 
Preventative measures are usually the most desirable method to reduce emissions since they eliminate or reduce the
actual generation of pollutants. Typically, the emission reduction is obtained using less energy and producing
less waste than using a control device to achieve the same emission reductions. Preventative measures used by the
industry are: (1) Product reformulations that replace products containing high levels of HAP and VOC with products
containing less HAP and VOC or that eliminate the HAP or VOC content completely, such as chemical strippers that contain
no organic HAP for depainting; (2) product reformulations, such as higher solids content coatings, that reduce the
amount of the HAP- and VOC-containing product used; 
(3) equipment changes that result in emission reductions, such as replacing conventional spray guns with HVLP spray
guns; and (4) work practice standards, such as housekeeping. 
Control devices are typically used where product reformulation is not feasible or where the concentration of the
exhaust stream is sufficiently high to warrant their use. Control devices may destroy the HAP and VOC, as with an incinerator,
or capture the HAP and VOC, as with a carbon adsorber. Often, the compounds captured by a control device can be recovered
for reuse. Control devices in predominant use by the industry for the reduction of organic HAP emissions are: (1) Carbon
adsorbers, (2) incinerators, and (3) ultraviolet oxidation. Activated carbon fiber adsorbents to concentrate
VOC emissions are frequently used in conjunction with incinerators. For inorganic HAP particulate emissions, reduction
is achieved predominantly through the use of filtration devices. 


1. Preventative Measures 


a. 

Product reformulation

. HAP and VOC emissions may be controlled by replacing products containing high concentrations of HAP and VOC with
ones that have reduced or eliminated HAP and VOC entirely. Each individual facility must evaluate the ability of the
new product to maintain standards of quality and performance. In addition, the potential overall environmental
benefit of the reformulated products must be carefully evaluated. 
(1) 

Product reformulation_coatings

. Product reformulations for coatings can be generally classified as waterborne, higher solids, powder, and self-priming
topcoats. Each category is discussed below.

<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Waterborne coatings.

 Waterborne coatings utilize a resin system that is dispersible in water. A portion of the organic solvent is then replaced
with water. The organic solvent may be 5 to 40 percent by weight of the waterborne coating, compared to a conventional
organic solvent-based coating containing as much as 80 percent by weight solvent. 
In addition to the lower solvent content, waterborne coatings have other advantages over solvent-based coatings.
Less overspray and improved spray transfer efficiency may be achieved with waterborne coatings than with conventional
coatings that utilize solvents with a density less than that of water. Additionally, because of the reduced solvent
content, waterborne coatings may be less toxic and present a reduced fire hazard. 
Waterborne coatings have limitations such as requiring spray guns with specific materials of construction, protection
from freezing, and better control of temperature and humidity during application. In addition, waterborne coatings
generally require longer drying times, are more sensitive to substrate material and cleanliness, and have lower
salt spray resistance. 
(b) 

Higher solids

. Higher solids coatings are solvent-based coating formulations that have been modified to lower the solvent-to-solids
ratio. The coatings usually contain 50 to 65 percent by volume solids, compared to conventional solvent-based coatings
that may contain up to 40 percent by volume solids. The increased solids content gives greater surface area coverage
per gallon of coating, which reduces the total volume of coating required. Consequently, solvent emissions are also
reduced when higher solids coatings are used to apply the same volume of solids that are applied with a conventional
solvent-based coating. 
Higher solids coatings generally have higher viscosities and longer drying times than conventional solvent-based
coatings. The higher viscosity tends to make spray application more difficult because it is harder to control gloss
and film thickness, and may require the coating to be heated before application. Higher solids coatings typically
are not used as dip coatings due to the difficulty in maintaining a uniform dispersion of solids in the dip tank. 
(c) 

Powder

. Powder coatings are a class of coatings applied electrostatically in dry form and then baked to cure. The coatings
consist of fine, dry particles of paint solids. During the curing step, the particles fuse to create a continuous film.
Use of powder coatings requires that the substrate must be able to withstand the high temperatures (typically greater
than 121 
 C (250 
 F) and frequently greater than 177 
 C (350 
 F)) necessary to cure the paint. 
The major advantage of using powder coatings is greatly reduced solvent emissions. The lack of a solvent base also
reduces fire hazard, toxicity, and the make-up air requirements of the spray booth. 
Powder coatings must be applied electrostatically, so they cannot be used on non-conductive parts such as composites.
Other reported disadvantages of powder coatings are the difficulty in obtaining a high quality appearance, production
must be shut down for color changes, the powder must remain dry at all times prior to application, and higher energy
costs. As noted above, the high curing temperatures of powder coatings precludes their use on temperature-sensitive
substrates. 
(d) 

Self-priming topcoats

. Self-priming topcoats eliminate the need to apply a primer coat between the substrate and the topcoat. Self-priming
topcoats have the adhesion and corrosion characteristics of a conventional primer and the environmental resistance
and functional fluid resistance of a conventional topcoat. These coatings also eliminate the need for chrome-containing
primers. 
(2) 

Product reformulation_hand-wipe cleaning solvents

. Product reformulations for hand-wipe cleaning that are prevalent in the aerospace industry can be classified as
aqueous, hydrocarbon-based, and non-chemical. Each category is discussed below:

<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) 

Aqueous. 

Aqueous cleaners contain at least 80 percent water, are non-flammable and non-combustible, and are completely soluble
in water. Other components may include corrosion inhibitors, alkalinity builders, organic surfactants, and bioenzyme
mixtures and nutrients depending on the desired soil removal properties. Aqueous cleaners have been used in non-critical
areas where strict cleanliness requirements do not have to be met, or where there are no confined spaces that may trap
residues of the cleaner. 
(b) 

Hydrocarbon-Based. 

Hydrocarbon-based cleaners are nonsemi-aqueous cleaners that are composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons and oxygenated
hydrocarbons. These cleaners have a maximum vapor pressure of 7 mm Hg at 20 
 C (3.75 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F) and contain no HAP or ozone depleting compounds. 
(c) 

Non-chemical. 

Several aerospace facilities have demonstrated the viability of using non-chemical methods such as dry media blasting
for cleaning operations. These methods are typically used to remove dry, scale-like deposits such as carbon residue
on engine components. Dry media blasting can usually be used only on components that can withstand the force of blasting
without deformation. 
b. 

Equipment changes. 

The aerospace industry has implemented several equipment changes that directly reduce the level of HAP emissions.
While there are equipment changes that affect emissions from every process, the three changes predominantly used
in the industry are high transfer efficiency spray guns, enclosed spray gun cleaners, and proportional paint mixers.
Each of these equipment changes are discussed below. 
(1) 

High transfer efficiency spray guns. 

Emissions from spray coating operations can be reduced through the use of spraying systems with higher transfer efficiency
than conventional spray guns. Transfer efficiency, expressed as a percentage, can be defined as the ratio of coating
solids actually applied to the surface of the component being coated to the amount of solids released from the spray
gun. Spraying systems with a higher transfer efficiency can coat the same surface area using less coating. Therefore,
the HAP emissions resulting from the use of this equipment are reduced compared to applying the same coating with conventional
spray equipment. 
High volume low pressure (HVLP) and electrostatic spraying systems are the primary high efficiency spray methods
used by the industry. HVLP spray guns use high volumes (10 to 25 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm)) of low pressure
(2 to 10 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) air to deliver the paint. The lower air pressure creates a lower particle
speed, resulting in a more controlled spray pattern with less overspray and bounce back from the substrate. With electrostatic
spray systems, atomized particles of coating acquire an electric charge as they pass through a high voltage field
at the end of the spray nozzle. This electric charge causes the particles to be attracted to the parts being painted,
which are electrically grounded. 
(2) 

Enclosed spray gun cleaners. 

Spray guns are typically cleaned at the end of every job, as well as between color changes. Manual cleaning of spray
guns involves disassembling the gun and placing the parts in a tray containing an appropriate cleaning solvent. The
residual paint is brushed or wiped off the parts, then the cleaning solvent is sprayed through the gun after it is reassembled.
Enclosed spray gun cleaners, however, are completely enclosed units that spray the cleaning solvent through and
over the spray gun. The enclosed unit eliminates most of the exposure of the cleaning solvent to the air, thereby greatly
reducing the organic HAP emissions from evaporation. 
(3) 

Proportional paint mixers. 

The majority of coatings used in the aerospace industry are multi-component mixtures, consisting of a base component
and one or more catalyst components. The components must be thoroughly mixed in the proper ratio immediately before
application. When this mixing is performed manually, a greater volume of coating is mixed than will actually be used
to ensure that there is enough coating available to complete the job. In contrast, proportional paint mixers pump
each component of the coating directly to the spray gun, where it is mixed and immediately applied. This results in
reduced coating waste and, consequently, reduced emissions. 
c. 

Work practice standards. 

Work practice standards are changes in the method of operation that do not affect the products used in the process or
the process itself, but result in a reduction in emissions. The aerospace industry has implemented work practice
standards programs for housekeeping measures and managed chemical distribution systems. 
Emissions of organic HAP compounds, particularly solvents, can be reduced by limiting both the amount of the material
exposed to the atmosphere and the length of the exposure. The emission reductions can be achieved by implementing
housekeeping measures whereby solvent-soaked cloth or paper used for hand-wipe cleaning are placed into bags or
containers that are kept closed. This eliminates the continual evaporation of the solvent from the cloth or paper
when they are not in use. The bags or containers can then be collected and disposed in such a manner (e.g., by incineration)
to eliminate any further solvent emissions. 
Managed chemical distribution systems centralize the distribution of solvents and coatings and control the amount
of these materials allowed to be used for a particular task. In this way, waste solvent and coatings are reduced, and
emissions from these waste materials are reduced.

2. Control Devices 


a. 

Carbon adsorbers. 

Adsorption systems are used to remove organic compounds from gas streams when strict limits on the outlet concentration
must be met, or when recovery of the compound is desired. Adsorption is effective on inlet concentrations ranging
from a few parts per billion to several thousand parts per million, and a flow rate of several hundred to several hundred
thousand cubic feet per minute. Carbon adsorbers typically have a removal efficiency of 95 to 99 percent. 
Once the carbon reaches saturation, it can be removed from the adsorber vessel and disposed or regenerated. The carbon
can also be regenerated with steam within the adsorber vessel. This option readily allows for the recovery of the organic
compounds for recycling. 
b. 

Incinerators. 

Two basic types of incinerators, thermal and catalytic, are used in the aerospace industry to remove organic contaminants.
Each type is discussed below. 
(1) 

Thermal incinerators. 

Thermal incinerators can be generally used on air streams with a wide concentration range of organics. These control
devices have minimal dependence on the characteristics of the organic contaminants, so they can be used to control
a wide variety of emission streams. Thermal incinerators can achieve removal efficiencies of 98 percent and higher.

The basic operation of thermal incinerators involves raising the inlet air stream to the incineration temperature
of the contaminants and maintaining the temperature for a specific residence time. The waste heat content of the incinerator
exhaust stream is used to preheat the inlet air stream. An auxiliary fuel is then typically required to raise the air
stream temperature to the incineration temperature. 
(2) 

Catalytic incinerators. 

Catalytic incinerators are similar to thermal incinerators except that they use a catalyst (a substance that accelerates
the rate of oxidation without undergoing a chemical change itself) to assist in the oxidation of organic compounds
to carbon dioxide and water. These incinerators are typically used for air streams with a low concentration of organics.
The removal efficiency of catalytic incinerators can be as high as 98 percent. 
c. 

Ultraviolet oxidation. 

An ultraviolet light oxidation (UVOX) system has been developed as an abatement device for air streams with low concentrations
of organic compounds. The air stream passes through particulate filters, then enters a reactor where it is exposed
to ultraviolet light which initiates the oxidation of the organics. Ozone and other oxygen-based oxidants are injected
into the reactor to react with the organics in the air stream to begin the oxidation of organics into carbon dioxide
and water. A typical removal efficiency for UVOX is reported to be 95 percent. 
d. 

Activated carbon fiber adsorbent. 

Another technology has been developed to control low concentration organic compound emissions (e.g., paint spray
booths). This technology utilizes an activated carbon fiber adsorbent to initially capture the organic emissions,
the concentration of which is too low to be removed by a control device such as an incinerator. The adsorbent system
consists of a honeycomb structure element made of activated carbon fiber paper in corrugated form. This structure
adsorbs the organics in the exhaust stream. As the activated carbon structure becomes saturated, the organics are
desorbed using hot air. This concentrated air stream can then be sent to an incinerator or other control device. The
portion of the activated carbon structure that was regenerated then begins the adsorption cycle again. 
e. 

Catalyst-coated filter media. 

Low concentration organic emissions (e.g., paint spray booths) can be controlled through the use of a catalyst-coated
filter media. The catalyst material is impregnated onto the fibers of a dry filter which can then be used wherever conventional
dry filters are used. The catalyst material, unlike activated carbon, permanently binds the organic material into
its crystalline matrix so that it will not later desorb. In addition to the coated filters, the catalyst material can
be used in a granular form to control emissions.

f. 

Filtration systems for inorganic HAP particulate emissions. 

Coating operations and blast depainting operations emit inorganic HAP in the form of particulates. For coating operations,
panel-type dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths are used to control these emissions. For blast depainting
operations, panel-type dry particulate filters are also used, as well as baghouses. 
The dry filters and baghouses capture particulates by trapping them as they try to pass through the small passages
in the filter media. The efficiency of the filter media is a function of the particle size, size of the passages in the
filter media, air flow through and pressure drop across the filter media, and physical characteristics of the particle.

Waterwash spray booths capture particles by forcing the air stream to pass through a spray or curtain of water. The
particles are trapped by the water and eventually collect as a sludge in the sump of the spray booth. 


V. Rationale for the Proposed Rule 


A. Regulatory Development Process for NESHAP 


During development of a NESHAP, the EPA collects information about the industry, including information on emission
source characteristics, control technologies, data from HAP emission tests at well-controlled facilities, and
information on the cost, energy, and other environmental impacts of emission control techniques. The EPA uses this
information in the development of possible regulatory approaches. 
If the source category contains major sources, then a MACT standard is required. Section 112(d)(3) of the Act defines
the minimum stringency requirements of the MACT standard for new and existing sources. This level of control is referred
to as the MACT ``floor,'' which needs to be determined as a starting point for developing the regulatory alternatives.

Once the floor has been determined for new and existing sources for a category or subcategory, the Administrator must
set MACT standards that are no less stringent than the floor level. Such standards must then be met by all sources within
the category or subcategory. However, in establishing standards, the Administrator may distinguish among classes,
types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory (section 112(d)(1) of the Act). Thus, for example, the
Administrator could establish two classes of sources within a category or subcategory based on size and establish
a different emission standard for each class as long as each standard is at least as stringent as the floor. The Act also
contains provisions for regulating area sources. However, except for certain recordkeeping requirements contained
in the General Provisions, these are not relevant to the proposed standards for aerospace sources, which apply only
to major sources. 
The next step in establishing a MACT standard is the development and analysis of regulatory alternatives. First,
information about the industry is analyzed to develop model plant populations for projecting national impacts,
including HAP emission reduction levels, costs, and energy and secondary environmental impacts. Several regulatory
alternatives (which may be different levels of emission control, different applicability criteria, or both, and
one of which is the MACT floor) are then evaluated to determine the most appropriate regulatory alternative to reflect
the MACT level. 
In addition, although NESHAP are normally structured in terms of numerical emission limits, alternative approaches
are sometimes necessary. Section 112(h) of the Act provides that if it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission
standard, then a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard may be established. For example, in some
cases source testing may be impossible or at least not practicable due to technological and economic limitations.

In the EPA's decision-making process, the regulatory alternatives considered for new versus existing sources may
be different and each alternative must be technically achievable. In selecting a regulatory alternative to represent
MACT, the EPA considers the achievable reduction in HAP emissions (and possibly other pollutants that are co-controlled),
the cost of control, and economic, energy, and other nonair quality health and environmental impacts. The overall
objective is the achievement of the maximum degree of emission reduction without unreasonable economic or other
impacts. 
The selected regulatory alternative is then translated into a proposed regulation. The regulation implementing
the MACT decision typically includes sections addressing applicability, standards, test methods and compliance
demonstration, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The preamble to the proposed regulation, published
in the 

Federal Register

, provides an explanation of the rationale for the decision. The public is invited to comment on the proposed regulation
during the public comment period. Following an evaluation of these comments, the EPA reaches a decision and promulgates
the final standards. 


B. Determining Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) ``Floors'' 


Once the EPA has identified the specific major source categories or subcategories that it intends to regulate under
section 112, MACT standards are set at a level at least as stringent as the ``floor.'' Congress has provided directives
to guide the EPA in the process of determining the regulatory floor.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00042 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Congress specified that the EPA must establish standards which require ``the maximum degree of reduction in emissions
of the hazardous air pollutants * * * that the Administrator * * * determines is achievable
* * *'' (section 112(d)(2) of the Act). In addition, Congress limited the Agency's discretion by defining
the minimum baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, as follows: 
(1) For new sources, the standards for a source category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than the emission
control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator,''
and 
(2) For existing sources, the standards ``may be less stringent than standards for new sources * * *
but shall not be less stringent, and may be more stringent than: (A) the average emission limitation achieved by the
best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information) * * *
or (B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources * * * for categories
or subcategories * * * with fewer than 30 sources'' (section 112(d)(3)of the Act). 


C. Selection of Pollutants and Source Category(ies) 


Section 112(b) of the Act lists the HAP to be regulated with standards established under section 112. Section 112(d),
as amended, requires the EPA to promulgate emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources and
area sources of the HAP listed in section 112(b). For the purpose of developing these standards, the EPA may distinguish
among classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory. The NESHAP are to be developed to control
HAP emissions from both new and existing sources pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act. 
The initial source category list (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992), required by section 112(c) of the Act, identifies source
categories for which NESHAP are to be established. This list includes all major source categories of HAP known to the
EPA at this time, and all area source categories for which a finding of adverse effects warranting regulation has been
made. 
The source category list identifies ``surface coating processes_aerospace industries'' as a source category because
it contains major sources emitting at least 10 tons of any one HAP or more than 25 tons of any combination of HAP annually.

The aerospace industry encompasses original equipment manufacturers of commercial, civil, and military (including
space) aerospace vehicles. In addition, rework facilities, which repair and repaint aerospace vehicles, constitute
a major portion of the industry. There are also many subcontractors providing support to the industry, especially
to the OEM's, who subcontract out various portions of the work. These subcontractors may engage in many of the processes
found at OEM or rework facilities, or in just a few. Further, subcontractors may conduct operations for non-aerospace
industries at facilities at which they conduct aerospace operations. 
For the purposes of this rule, the EPA has defined the source category as consisting of all facilities engaged in the
manufacture or rework of any aerospace vehicle or component. This includes all OEM's, rework facilities, and subcontractors.
The EPA decided to include subcontractors in the proposed rule because they perform substantial amounts of work,
much of which could otherwise be carried out at an OEM or rework facility and which is virtually indistinguishable
from processes at the OEM or rework facility. However, if the subcontractors' facilities are not major sources, they
would not be subject to the proposed standards. 
Early in the development of the proposed standards, the EPA developed model plants to correspond to the basic structure
of the industry_commercial and military segments, each having OEM and rework facilities_with the intent of developing
subcategories for standards development, if necessary. On the basis of the information provided, however, the EPA
has found that, with one exception for depainting operations, there is no need to distinguish among these segments
for the processes for which standards are being proposed under the proposed rule.

D. Selection of Emission Points Covered by the Proposed Rule


The proposed rule would limit organic HAP emissions from the following basic aerospace operations: cleaning, primer
application, topcoat application, depainting, chemical milling maskant application, and the handling and storage
of waste. The proposed rule would apply to all organic HAP emission points within these operations located within
aerospace manufacturing or rework facilities that are major sources. In addition, the proposed rule would require
control of emissions from these operations if they are performed in any of the operations for which standards are not
being proposed. For example, hand-wipe cleaning operations are performed at several stages within composite processing
operations. The hand-wipe cleaning operation, a process covered by the proposed standard, would be subject to the
standard, regardless of where in the facility it occurred.
Standards are being proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from primer application, topcoat application, and depainting
operations.
A discussion of the rationale for including or excluding in this proposed rule the basic processes listed in Section
V.A. is presented below.


1. Operations for Which Standards Are Being Proposed


a. 

Organic HAP emissions. 

As noted above, the EPA is proposing organic HAP emission standards for cleaning, primer application, topcoat application,
depainting, and chemical milling maskant application, and the handling and storage of waste. Together, these operations
are estimated to account for approximately 94 percent of the organic HAP emissions from the industry_cleaning, 87.5
percent; primers and topcoats, 2.1 percent; depainting, 2.6 percent; and chemical milling maskants, 1.5 percent.
Based on the information obtained from the section 114 questionnaires and meetings with the industry, there are many
readily available techniques to achieve substantial emission reductions in each of these operations. For example,
many chemical milling maskant operations were reported as using either solvent-based chemical milling maskants
with control devices or waterborne chemical milling maskants. With regard to cleaning operations, many product
reformulations are available for hand-wipe cleaning, and there are several equipment and work practice standards
for spray gun cleaning that reduce organic HAP emissions. While methylene chloride chemical stripping is the prevalent
method for depainting aerospace vehicles, many facilities are using non-HAP alternatives. These alternatives
are being used by both commercial and military facilities to reduce emissions from depainting operations. Sufficient
data exist for establishing MACT based on non-HAP alternatives for both commercial and military depainting operations.
Therefore, these processes are included in the proposed rule. Section 114 questionnaire data and the existence of
State and local regulations identify the use of high transfer efficiency spray guns in the aerospace industry. Adequate
information exists for establishing MACT for the method of application of primers and topcoats and for limiting the
organic HAP content of the coatings. Based on section 114 questionnaire data, nearly all facilities employ housekeeping
measures to control emissions from waste storage. Sufficient data exist, therefore, to establish MACT.
In summary, based upon their relative contribution to overall organic HAP emissions and the use of demonstrated emission
control technologies and techniques to achieve emission reduction, the EPA selected these operations for regulation.
b. 

Inorganic HAP emissions. 

The EPA is proposing inorganic HAP emission standards for primer application, topcoat application, and depainting
operations. Based on section 114 questionnaire responses, there are readily available techniques that are used
extensively in the industry to control these emissions. While the inorganic HAP emissions do not represent a large
percentage of overall emissions from the industry, the emissions represent potential threats to health because
of the highly toxic nature of the inorganic HAP (e.g., chromium and cadmium). For these reasons, the EPA selected these
operations for regulation.

2. Excluded Operations


The EPA is not proposing standards for four non-coating related operations_chemical milling, metal finishing,
electrodeposition, and composite processing_and for four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding
primers, sealants, and specialty coatings.
Organic HAP emissions were reported from all four of the non-coating related processes. Emissions from these four
operations account for less than 1 percent of the total organic HAP emissions from aerospace facilities. Most of the
organic HAP emissions from these operations are due to emissions from the use of cleaning solvents, which are being
proposed for regulation under the proposed rule. The EPA has determined that requiring control of the remaining organic
HAP emissions is not feasible because no demonstrated control measures could be identified. Therefore, the EPA is
proposing no further control for organic HAP emissions from these four operations other than what would be achieved
by the proposed standards for cleaning solvents.
The four coating-related operations_adhesives, adhesive bonding primers, sealants, and specialty coatings_are
similar in many ways to primers and topcoats, for which organic HAP emission standards are being proposed. These four
coating-related operations account for relatively small amounts of organic HAP emissions, and the coatings tend
to be very specialized. Subcategorization can be significant, especially for specialty coatings, resulting in
lower potential emission reductions. Many of the coatings in these four operations (e.g., sealants and adhesives)
are already being applied using high transfer techniques, including hand application. This results in little opportunity
for emission reduction through improved transfer efficiency. For spray applied sealants, there is also little opportunity
to use higher transfer efficiency equipment because the viscosity of these sealants requires the use of high pressure,
conventional spray guns. In terms of potential emission reduction from lower organic HAP content coatings, virtually
no organic HAP content data were available to categorize these coatings. The time necessary to gather the data would
have significantly delayed this proposed rule. For all of these reasons, standards are not being proposed for these
operations.
Wastewater and storage tanks emit relatively small amounts of HAP and, according to the section 114 questionnaire
responses, no aerospace facilities used any means to control these emissions. The EPA then considered the option
of requiring applicable controls used in other industries on these types of sources. These control measures were
evaluated and found to be too costly when compared to the emission reductions that would be achieved (approximately
$126,000 per ton of HAP emissions reduction for storage tanks).
Other requirements in the standards may result in a direct reduction of emissions from wastewater and storage tanks.
For example, the depainting standards may eliminate the majority of the estimated 152 million gallons of HAP-containing
chemical stripper usage if the majority of sources use media blasting methods. This stripper is typically treated
in wastewater treatment systems after use. Also, the hand-wipe cleaning standards will virtually eliminate the
storage tanks for organic HAP-containing solvents since the use of these solvents will be significantly reduced.
For these reasons, the EPA is not proposing to regulate HAP emissions from wastewater and storage tanks in the proposed
rule.


E. Selection of the Basis for the Proposed Rule


Section 112 of the Act defines a major source as any stationary source that emits 9.1 Mg/yr (10 tpy) or more of any one
HAP or 22.7 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more of total HAP. The Act states that new major sources must achieve the maximum achievable
control technology (MACT), which is the level of emission control already achieved in practice by the best controlled
similar source. The Act further states that emission standards promulgated for existing sources may be less stringent
than standards for new sources; however, standards for existing sources must not be less stringent than the average
emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources.
For all operations being covered by the proposed rule, the EPA has determined that, taking into account cost, nonair
quality health and environmental impacts, and energy impacts, MACT is equal to the MACT floors for both existing and
new sources. In addition, MACT for new sources was found to be equal to MACT for existing sources. The EPA has determined
that no further emission reductions can be achieved for new sources through the use of demonstrated technology than
the level of reduction represented by MACT for existing sources.

To evaluate the regulatory alternatives, model plants were developed based on market segment (commercial or military),
work type (OEM or rework), and size (small, medium, or large). These characteristics were examined to determine whether
any technological justification existed to differentiate the proposed standards by market segment, work type,
or size. Based on this examination, the EPA has determined that, other than one exception under the depainting standards,
there is no justification for differentiating between these characteristics. For example, rework facilities are
required to conform to OEM specifications, which dictate the processes and coatings that can be used. Consequently,
rework facilities do not typically incorporate technology that is not used by the OEM's. Also, no compelling reasons
were identified as to why a facility of one size could not incorporate the technology used by a facility of another size.




1. Cleaning Operation 



According to data obtained from the Bureau of the Census, approximately 25 percent of facilities with aerospace manufacturing
SIC codes are located in California. Based on information provided by four California districts_SCAQMD, Imperial
County Air Pollution Control District (APCD), Ventura County APCD, and San Diego APCD_virtually all of the California
facilities are located in these districts, and more than half are located in the SCAQMD alone. Based on this information,
more than 12 percent of the total number of sources are, then, subject to the rules in these four districts. 

Consequently, the regulations in these four districts (i.e., SCAQMD Rule 1124, Imperial County APCD Rule 425, Ventura
County APCD Rule 74.13, and San Diego APCD Rule 67.9) were examined to determine the emission limitations in these
districts. These regulations specify vapor pressure limits and housekeeping measures for hand-wipe cleaning solvents.
The EPA then investigated to determine if the regulations resulted in California facilities emitting less HAP from
this process than facilities outside of California. Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, California
facilities emitted approximately 48 percent less HAP than non-California facilities in ozone nonattainment areas
for hand-wipe cleaning operations. These emissions were calculated on a pounds of HAP emitted per employee basis,
using the total number of employees at the facilities (the number of employees for hand-wipe cleaning only was not
available). The conclusion made from these data was that the California regulations are an effective means of producing
permanent and quantifiable emission reductions, and that the sources subject to these regulations are the best-performing
sources in this source category. Since these sources also comprise more than 12 percent of the sources in the category,
the MACT floor was based on their control levels. 

It was impossible to distinguish the separate effects of housekeeping and vapor pressure limits on the emission rates
from hand-wipe cleaning operations. Consequently, both were assumed to be necessary to achieve the calculated emission
reductions. While one cannot ``average'' housekeeping measures, based on common aspects among the four rules, housekeeping
measures of maintaining closed containers for the storage of fresh solvent, spent solvent, and solvent-soaked cloth
and paper were established as one part of the MACT floor. 

The second part of the MACT floor for hand-wipe cleaning is a vapor pressure limitation on the solvents being used.
The SCAQMD, the San Diego AQMD, and the Imperial County APCD specify a maximum vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C. Ventura County APCD specifies 25 mm Hg at 20 
 C. However, the EPA believes that it is inappropriate to give equal weight to the Ventura rule in determining
the MACT floor because this district contains only three aerospace facilities compared to the hundreds located in
the South Coast and San Diego districts. Furthermore, industry comments suggested that these three facilities are
not representative of the industry and do not constitute a similar source as required by the Act. The EPA did, however,
consider a weighted average vapor pressure limitation, but the vapor pressure value obtained did not correspond
to any demonstrated technology. Since more than half, and possibly as much as 90 percent, of the aerospace facilities
in California are located in the South Coast district, the EPA has determined that the 45 mm Hg vapor pressure is more
representative of the ``average'' limitation on cleaning solvents among the best performing facilities and represents
the MACT floor for both new and existing sources. More stringent levels (e.g., a weighted average vapor pressure value)
were not considered to be achievable by all sources. Therefore, the EPA has selected the 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F) as the basis for the standards for hand-wipe cleaning solvents.

Information collected on cleaning solvents also showed that some hand-wipe cleaning solvents have both a very low
vapor pressure and a very low evaporation rate. Available data indicate that low evaporation rates also contribute
to minimizing emissions. These cleaning solvents are demonstrated technology for limited applications and their
use would reduce organic HAP emissions as much as or more than the proposed vapor pressure limit. Therefore, the EPA
is proposing to encourage their use by including an approved composition list for cleaning solvents in the proposed
rule. The EPA welcomes comments on this list and proposals for adding to the list before final promulgation of the rule.


Based on data provided by aerospace facilities in response to the section 114 questionnaires, spray guns used to apply
coatings are cleaned either manually or in enclosed gun cleaners. Based on information obtained during plant visits,
enclosed gun cleaners are demonstrated to reduce emissions. 
Each of the 61 facilities that reported a spray gun cleaning method was classified as to whether the spray guns were
cleaned manually or with an enclosed cleaner. Eighteen of the 61 facilities (29 percent) reported using enclosed
gun cleaners; therefore, enclosed gun cleaners were considered to represent the MACT floor level of control. The
EPA also received information from the industry on the use of cleaning methods other than enclosed gun cleaners. After
review of this information, the EPA determined that adequate technical justification was presented to show that
the alternate cleaning methods were as effective as enclosed spray gun cleaners in controlling organic HAP emissions.
Consequently, in addition to enclosed spray gun cleaners, the EPA is proposing to allow the use of: (1) Unatomized
discharge of solvent into a waste container that is kept closed when not in use, (2) hand cleaning in a vat that is kept
closed when not in use, and (3) the use of atomized spray into a waste container fitted with a device designed to capture
atomized solvent emissions. 

Based on information received from the responses to the section 114 questionnaires, plant visits, and industry meetings,
the EPA learned that there are certain cleaning operations for which low VOC, low HAP, or low vapor pressure cleaning
solvents do not have widespread use that would constitute a demonstrated technology. The EPA, therefore, is proposing
to exempt these cleaning operations from the requirements to use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition
list and the proposed vapor pressure limit of 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F). These operations are listed in  63.744(e) of the proposed rule. 

The use of cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list is not yet demonstrated for the proposed
exempt cleaning operations. However, there are many new cleaning solvents being developed, some of which are very
close to being used within the industry for some of these proposed exempt cleaning operations. To encourage the use
of available compliant cleaning solvents and the ones being developed, the EPA considered imposing a limit on the
annual usage of non-compliant cleaning solvents for exempt operations. However, no data were available for use in
establishing this limit. 



2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations 



As noted above, over 12 percent of the aerospace industry is located in four districts in California. The SCAQMD, Ventura
County APCD, Imperial County APCD, and Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD rules all require high transfer efficiency
coating application methods. The application methods specified in these rules were adopted as the MACT floor. The
specified methods are electrostatic application, flow coat application, dip coat application, roll coating, brush
coating, and HVLP spraying. 

The EPA recognizes that there may be other application methods that achieve a level of emissions equivalent to the
application methods allowed in the proposed rule. Therefore, the EPA is requesting comments identifying these other
application methods. These comments should include test data demonstrating that, in actual production conditions,
the application method achieves a level of emissions at least equivalent to the level of emissions achieved by HVLP
or electrostatic spray application methods. The EPA will review these comments and, where adequate technical justification
exists, amend the list of approved application methods. 

The EPA also examined whether or not there are demonstrated low organic HAP content primers or topcoats that could
be used in conjunction with high transfer application methods to establish the MACT floor to reduce emissions. To
this end, the EPA examined State and local regulations and the data obtained through the section 114 responses.

State and local regulations for aerospace coatings use VOC content as the means of regulating coating emissions.
Consequently, no directed effort has been made to control the organic HAP content of these coatings. Data on coating
VOC content are readily available from both the coating manufacturers and the coating users, but no comprehensive
data exist for coating organic HAP content. 

The data obtained from the section 114 responses showed that the organic HAP content varies widely and randomly with
the VOC content. This is not surprising since, as noted above, there have been efforts to limit only the VOC content
in the coatings and not the organic HAP content. However, the data show that the organic HAP content is typically 50
percent less than the VOC content. Where the organic HAP content was higher than the VOC content, the EPA found that
this was the result of the use of exempt solvents (those solvents determined by the EPA to have negligible photochemical
reactivity) that are also organic HAP. 

There are a number of chemicals commonly found in coatings that are not on the list of 189 HAP (section 112(b) of the Act)
including methyl amylketone (2-heptanone), cyclohexanone, and isopropyl alcohol. Currently, the EPA does not
have adequate health data to determine the relative toxicity of these organic HAP substitutes and, therefore, does
not want to establish a requirement that would encourage their use as substitutes in coatings. Since these potential
substitutes are also VOC, the proposed standards would limit both organic HAP and VOC content, rather than organic
HAP only. The effect of this dual limit will be to reduce the total amount of organic emissions from coating operations,
eliminate the use of the few very high organic HAP content primers and topcoats, and establish a cap on the organic HAP
content of primers and topcoats that will be developed in the future.

The organic HAP and VOC limits were determined by ranking the facilities that reported usage of primers or topcoats
from the lowest to the highest weighted average VOC content of all primers or topcoats used at the facility. The weighted
average VOC content that represented the average of the best 12 percent was selected as the VOC limit. This value was
350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats. As discussed earlier, the limited data available
to the EPA indicate that organic HAP content is typically lower than VOC content. However, no reasonable limit could
be identified. Therefore, the EPA is proposing an organic HAP content limit at the same level as for VOC. The proposed
limits for organic HAP are, therefore, 350 g/l (2.9 lb/gal) for primers and 420 g/l (3.5 lb/gal) for topcoats.

The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that the inorganic HAP emissions from nearly all primer and topcoat
application operations were controlled by dry particulate filters or waterwash spray booths. Since no other technology
was identified that can be used to control inorganic HAP emissions, the use of filters and waterwash was adopted as
the MACT floor.



3. Depainting Operation



The information obtained on depainting operations showed the pervasive use of organic HAP-containing chemical
strippers to remove paint. However, information was also obtained showing that many aerospace depainting operations
are using alternative methods that do not utilize organic HAP, including organic HAP-free chemical strippers and
dry media blasting techniques. The information also showed that not all commercial aerospace vehicles are fully
coated. In these instances, the amount of organic HAP emissions from depainting is less than it would be if the same
vehicle were fully coated.

The quantity of organic HAP emissions from depainting operations at several commercial rework facilities was readily
available. However, very limited emissions data were obtained through the section 114 questionnaire responses
for military aircraft depainting operations. The EPA considered several parameters to establish which facilities
were the best performing ones. The most simple method would be to determine the pounds of organic HAP emissions per
aircraft. This would not, however, take into account the difference in outer surface area from one model of aircraft
to another and, hence, the difference in stripper volume required for each aircraft. Another basis would be to determine
the organic HAP emissions per square foot of outer surface area actually painted. This method would not distinguish
between the total emissions for stripping an aircraft that has only a portion of the outer surface area painted, and
the total emissions for stripping the same aircraft with the entire outer surface area painted. Therefore, both methods
were rejected.

Another basis for determining the best performing operations relates the pounds of organic HAP emissions to the total
outer surface area of the aircraft. This effectively takes into account the effectiveness of all methods used to depaint
aerospace vehicles and distinguishes the lower emissions achieved when only a portion of the outer surface area is
painted from the emissions when a larger portion is painted. However, insufficient data were obtained through the
section 114 questionnaire responses to develop an emission rate for military aircraft depainting operations.

A fourth consideration was to identify the basic techniques being used and rank them according to their relative effectiveness
in reducing organic HAP emissions. The EPA elected to use this as the measure for identifying the best performing facilities.
The different depainting techniques were also evaluated as to their applicability throughout the industry.

Three basic depainting techniques are used by the facilities for which the EPA has information: Methylene chloride
based chemical strippers, chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP, and blasting methods. (Although blasting
methods are very effective in reducing and essentially eliminating organic HAP emissions from depainting operations,
they do produce particulate inorganic HAP emissions. However, these emissions are typically well-controlled with
particulate filters, which are almost always integral to the blasting systems. In addition, the proposed standards
would require such control on inorganic HAP emissions, as discussed in section II.B. of this preamble.)

Based on section 114 questionnaires, site visits, and information provided by the industry, the EPA has information
on depainting methods at 20 facilities. Of these facilities, 14 were identified as using either a blasting method
(i.e., wheat starch or plastic media) or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP.

The EPA then determined the aircraft models being stripped at each of these 14 facilities. This analysis showed that
military fighters and transports, military and commercial helicopters, civil aircraft, and nearly all models of
commercial airliners are currently being stripped with one or more of these non-HAP methods. Given the wide applicability
of these processes throughout the industry, the EPA determined the MACT floor to be equivalent to the use of either
media blasting or chemical strippers that do not contain organic HAP.

This analysis also showed, however, that some organic HAP emissions from depainting still occurred at facilities
using blast methods or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. This is due to the fact that certain parts (e.g.,
wing flaps, engine nacelles, and radomes) are removed from the aircraft and depainted separately. This is primarily
due to the fragile nature or specific depainting needs of these parts. Due to the wide range of parts removed and the
inconsistency in the type of parts removed from one model of aircraft to another, the applicability of using blast
techniques or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP on these parts could not be determined. Consequently,
these parts are exempted from the proposed standards.

<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition, the EPA determined that a small portion of the aircraft cannot be stripped with blasting methods. For
example, some areas of the aircraft are masked to prevent intrusion of the blast media. The edge of the masking will
often cover coated areas and, thus, prevent the blasting media from removing the coating from these areas. This coating
must then be removed (referred to as spot stripping), usually with an organic HAP-containing chemical stripper.
Another example of spot stripping is the removal of coatings from a small area of the outer surface of the aircraft in
order to perform testing and inspection of the bare metal. Also, blasting methods may have difficulty removing some
decals. Consequently, organic HAP solvents may be used to soften or remove these decals. For these reasons, exemptions
for spot stripping and decal removal are necessary in order to allow the use of blast depainting methods to meet the
proposed standards.

The EPA did, however, seek to limit the amount of organic HAP-containing chemical strippers used for radome, parts
and spot stripping and decal removal. Data provided in the section 114 questionnaire responses were used to establish
the amount of stripper used for these operations. Data were not available for radome and parts depainting; however,
usage of chemical strippers for spot stripping and decal removal was available from commercial airlines for a limited
number of aircraft types. Since information was not available for all aircraft types, the stripper usage for the largest
commercial aircraft was used as the basis for the usage exemption.

The usage information was, however, limited to commercial aircraft. Military sources within the aerospace industry
provided additional data to the EPA that established a technical justification for a higher usage limitation for
military aircraft. This information was used as the basis for the usage limitation for spot stripping and decal removal
for military aircraft.

The section 114 questionnaire responses showed that all facilities (7 respondents) that use media blasting to depaint
use either dry particulate filters or baghouses to control particulate emissions from blast depainting methods.
While electrostatic precipitators were identified as a possible control technology, the cost of the precipitators
was believed to be considerably higher than the filtration methods already in use. Therefore, particulate filters
and baghouses were used as the basis for developing the MACT floor for operations that use media blasting.



4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation



Not all aerospace facilities perform chemical milling maskant operations. Of those responding to the section 114
request, twelve reported chemical milling operations. To identify the best performing twelve percent of the sources,
the emission rate for each source was calculated by dividing the organic HAP emissions by the total usage of chemical
milling maskants to obtain pounds of organic HAP emitted per gallon of chemical milling maskant (less water) as applied.
The emissions value took into account control measures such as carbon adsorbers or waterborne chemical milling maskants.
The sources were then ranked from the lowest emission rate to the highest.

For this operation, the best performing 12 percent of the sources is represented by the two sources with the lowest
emission rates. One of these sources utilized a carbon adsorber to abate the emissions from a solvent-based chemical
milling maskant. The other source utilized a waterborne chemical milling maskant with no abatement. Each of these
two facilities had the same organic HAP emission rate of 1.3 lb/gal. Therefore, this was selected to represent the
MACT floor.



5. Handling and Storage of Waste



Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, 181 non-wastewater waste streams were reported. Every stream
was controlled by housekeeping measures such as keeping the waste material in closed drums. Thus, housekeeping measures
were established as the MACT floor for handling and storage of waste.




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

While no data were available for the effect on emissions from the housekeeping measures, it is expected that emissions
will be reduced based on the data from California facilities for keeping cleaning solvents in closed containers.
Consequently, housekeeping measures were used as the basis for the proposed standard. 
In addition, existing RCRA regulations govern handling and storage practices for certain types of wastes. Since
the EPA did not want to create a situation where possible conflicts with the RCRA regulations could arise, the proposed
rule exempts wastes covered under the RCRA regulations.



F. Selection of the Format of the Proposed Rule



Several formats could be used to implement the control techniques selected as the basis for the proposed standards.
Section 112(d) of the Act requires that emission standards for control of HAP be prescribed unless, in the judgment
of the Administrator, it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce emission standards. Section 112(h) of the Act defines
two conditions under which it is not feasible to prescribe or to enforce emission standards. These conditions are:
(1) If the HAP cannot be emitted through a conveyance device or (2) if the application of measurement methodology to
a particular class of sources is not practicable due to technological or economic limitations. If emission standards
are not feasible to prescribe or enforce, then the Administrator may instead promulgate equipment, work practice,
design or operational standards, or a combination thereof.



1. Cleaning Operation



The cleaning operation for which the EPA is proposing standards emits a variety of organic HAP. For many of these organic
HAP, emission measurement methods either do not exist or would be very expensive to implement. In addition, the nature
of some cleaning operations (e.g., hand-wipe cleaning) makes collection through a conveyance device difficult
if not impossible. Therefore, the EPA determined that emission standards are not feasible for these operations.

The EPA then considered design, equipment, work practice, and operational standards for these operations. The EPA
examined the California regulations, which had been determined to represent the floor level of control, to identify
the specific types of measures adopted for hand-wipe cleaning, flush cleaning, and spray gun cleaning. An analysis
by the EPA of the aerospace facilities' data showed that facilities subject to the California requirements emitted
approximately 48 percent less organic HAP from their operations than non-California operations in ozone nonattainment
areas. The EPA concluded that the formats of the California regulations are effective in providing quantifiable
and achievable emission reductions. Therefore, the same formats are being proposed for the NESHAP as follows: (1)
For hand-wipe cleaning operations, use of solvents that conform to the approved composition list or vapor pressure
limits, and housekeeping measures, (2) for spray gun cleaning, an equipment standard and housekeeping measures,
and (3) for flush cleaning, housekeeping measures.

The EPA is also proposing standards to limit the organic HAP emissions that may occur from leaks from enclosed spray
gun cleaners. A format based on emission limits was not possible, since there were no data to determine the emissions
from leaks. Also, no design, equipment, or work practice standards were identified that would prevent leaks from
occurring. Consequently, the EPA determined that the only format that would ensure a minimum of organic HAP emissions
from leaks was an operational standard that required leaks to be repaired within a certain amount of time.



2. Primer and Topcoat Application Operations



The formats selected by the EPA for the proposed organic HAP emission limits for primer and topcoat application operations
are: (1) A limitation on both the VOC and organic HAP content, (2) a percent reduction and performance standard for
control devices, and (3) an equipment standard for the application of primers and topcoats.





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00051 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The EPA considered a format based on actual emissions from the primer and topcoat application operations. However,
the EPA has information that many larger facilities have several hundred spray booths in which primer or topcoat application
operations could take place. Monitoring of that many individual emission sources would not be feasible for either
the facility or for enforcement of the standards by the EPA or state agencies. In addition, actual emissions would
have to be linked to the production rate and the product produced at the facility. The EPA does not have adequate data
to quantify emissions based on production or the product produced. Therefore, the EPA rejected this format.

The EPA then considered a limitation on the organic HAP and VOC content (mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume)
of coating as applied. This format would essentially impose an emission limitation on each source, but allow flexibility
in the manner of compliance. Each source would have the choice of using compliant coatings and averaging between compliant
and non-compliant coatings. This format will reduce the amount of total organics, is easily enforced with Method
24 for VOC content and manufacturer's data for organic HAP content, and will cap the total amount of organic HAP that
a primer or topcoat can contain.

The EPA is also allowing the use of control devices to reduce organic HAP and VOC emissions from primer and topcoat application
operations. The format of the standards must ensure that as much of the emissions as practicable are being controlled.
The EPA chose a format that specifies the overall control efficiency (capture efficiency multiplied by the removal
efficiency) because overall control efficiency is the best representation of the control effectiveness of control
devices. It is also easily enforceable since the EPA has published test methods for both capture and removal efficiency.

The EPA is proposing to set an equipment standard to reduce HAP emissions from the application of primers and topcoats.
This format requires the use of certain specified coating application equipment or coating methods that result in
higher transfer efficiencies than conventional spray equipment, thus reducing emissions. This format allows facilities
the flexibility to choose the method of application most appropriate to the coating and substrate being coated.

The EPA first considered the data presented in the section 114 questionnaire responses to determine the format of
the standards for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats. The level of control (expressed as a percentage)
of dry particulate filters and waterwash spray booths was reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses. However,
the basis for the reported control efficiency was primarily engineering judgement and manufacturer's data, which
could not be verified through standardized testing. While the Act specifies that emission standards be developed
whenever possible, the EPA determined that the available data were not of sufficient quality to develop such a standard.

The EPA then considered an equipment standard that described physical characteristics of high efficiency particulate
filters and waterwash systems. However, due to the number of different filter and waterwash systems and variety of
designs available, no concise description could be developed.

The EPA then developed a format that specified that all primer and topcoat application operations must be conducted
in a ventilated booth or hangar equipped with filters or waterwash systems. The selection of the actual filters and
waterwash systems would be left to the individual facilities.



3. Depainting Operation



The demonstrated technologies for depainting that represent the best performing 12 percent of sources are blast
methods (e.g., plastic media and wheat starch blasting) and chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA
considered an operational format for the proposed standards that would require one of these methods to be used. However,
many other alternative depainting methods are under development that have the potential to reduce organic HAP emissions
as effectively as blasting or chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP. The EPA did not want to limit the development
of these alternative depainting methods, so the operational format was rejected. 
The EPA then considered the level of organic HAP emissions from blasting, chemical strippers that contain no organic
HAP, and other alternative depainting methods. With the exception of spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting,
all of these methods have the potential to emit no organic HAP. The EPA, therefore, chose an emission standard format
that specifies no organic HAP emissions from depainting, with exemptions for spot, decal, radome, and parts depainting.
This format would allow the currently demonstrated depainting methods, as well as alternative methods that may be
developed in the future.

While spot stripping and decal removal have been exempted from the proposed standards, the EPA, in selecting the format
of the exemption, intends to limit the use of organic HAP-containing stripper to the lowest amount necessary. The
EPA selected a limitation on the annual average amount (in gallons) of organic HAP-containing stripper used per aircraft.

The format for the proposed standards for inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations was developed from
the section 114 questionnaire responses. The seven facilities that reported blast depainting operations were ranked
according to control efficiency of the filtration methods (particulate filters or baghouses) used to control particulate
emissions. The best performing 12 percent of these sources are represented by the one facility with the highest control
efficiency. This facility achieved a reported control efficiency of 99 percent and was chosen to represent the MACT
floor.

The control efficiency data reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses consisted of engineering judgement
estimates and information obtained from the filter manufacturers. No test data were reported. Due to this lack of
quantifiable test data, the EPA is requesting comments on whether the 99 percent level of control represents the demonstrated
level of technology for the control of particulate emissions from blast depainting. These comments should contain
a technical justification, including test data where possible, for any recommended level of control.



4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation



An emission limitation based on the mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume applied was selected for chemical milling
maskants. There are essentially two means of complying with the proposed standards: (1) Solvent-based chemical
milling maskant with a carbon adsorber to reduce emissions or (2) a waterborne chemical milling maskant with an organic
HAP content equal to or less than the proposed standard. This format allows facilities to choose either method (or
develop an equivalent method) without giving preference to either solvent-based or waterborne chemical milling
maskants.



5. Handling and Storage of Waste



The rationale for the format of the proposed standards for handling and storage of waste is essentially the same as
that for housekeeping measures for cleaning solvents. Since no data were available to establish an emission limitation
and control equipment was not technically feasible, a work practice format requiring housekeeping measures was
selected as the most appropriate means of reducing emissions.



G. Selection of Emission Test Methods and Monitoring Requirements



1. Emission Test Methods



In addition to the specific test methods described below for each affected source, the proposed rule adopts the provisions
specified in  63.7 of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.






a. 

Cleaning operation. 

For hand-wipe cleaning, the proposed standards would allow owners or operators to use either a cleaning solvent that
conforms to an approved composition list or a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 mm Hg. Procedures
are, therefore, necessary for determining whether a cleaning solvent conforms to the approved composition list
or meets the vapor pressure limitation.

The other portion of the proposed standards for cleaning operations (including spray gun cleaning) includes housekeeping
measures, equipment standards, or work practice standards, for which no test methods or procedures are required
to demonstrate compliance.

Those facilities that use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list would have to demonstrate
how the solvents comply. The EPA is proposing that data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent be used
to show compliance. The data must show all components of the cleaning solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved
composition definitions is met.

To determine the composite vapor pressure of a cleaning solvent, the EPA is proposing that for single-component cleaning
solvents data supplied by the manufacturer or from standard engineering reference texts be used. This information
is readily available and, for single component cleaning solvents, should be readily acceptable.

For multi-component cleaning solvents, it is necessary to determine the composite vapor pressure of the cleaning
solvent. This requires determining the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent and each one's vapor
pressure. Once these are known, then a procedure to combine the information must be followed to calculate the composite
vapor pressure.

The EPA is proposing that gas chromatographic analysis, following the procedures outlined in E 260-85, be used
to quantify the amount of each organic compound. The vapor pressure of each organic compound would then be determined,
again, either by the manufacturer's data or from standard engineering reference texts, as discussed above. For combining
these data to calculate the composite vapor pressure, the EPA is proposing that the blend be assumed to be an ideal solution
where Raoult's law applies. While more accurate methods are available, the cost and time to conduct those methods
and the small gain in accuracy are not justifiable when compared to the ease of calculating composite vapor pressure
assuming an ideal solution where Raoult's law applies. Further, the composite vapor pressure of any blend changes
with the conditions under which it is applied. This normal variability would cause some cleaning solvents to meet
the composite vapor limit under certain conditions, but not others, if the vapor pressure test methods were used instead
of the calculation.

b. 

Primer and topcoat application operations.

 One part of the proposed standards for primer and topcoat application operations requires the use of specified high
transfer efficiency application equipment, or equivalent.



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00053 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As long as this equipment is installed, operated, and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications, it
should perform with high transfer efficiency. Therefore, the EPA is not proposing any test methods or procedures
for this part of the primer and topcoat standards. 

Owners or operators who want to use application equipment other than that specified in the proposed rule must demonstrate
that it is equivalent in reducing organic HAP and VOC emissions. To make an equivalency determination, the owner or
operator must demonstrate that the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the alternative method are equal to
or less than the emissions generated by HVLP or electrostatic spray guns under the actual production conditions in
which the alternative method is intended to be used. This level of emissions is equivalent to the emissions demonstrated
by California facilities that are subject to similar rules. 

Before implementing the alternative application method, the facility must determine the organic HAP and VOC emissions
that were generated by the process over the 90-day period immediately preceding the implementation of the alternative
application method. During this initial 90-day period, only HVLP or electrostatic spray guns could be used. These
emissions would be compared to the organic HAP and VOC emissions generated by the same process using the alternative
application method to coat an equivalent amount of parts and assemblies as coated during the initial 90-day period
using identical coatings. The organic HAP and VOC emissions generated during the use of the alternative application
method must be equal to or less than the emissions generated during the initial 90-day period. 

In determining compliance with the organic HAP and VOC content levels, an owner or operator would have the flexibility
to use compliant coatings or to average uncontrolled compliant and non-compliant coatings. (Averaging between
primers and topcoats would not be allowed, nor would averaging between controlled and uncontrolled coatings.) Test
methods and procedures are, therefore, necessary to determine the organic HAP and VOC content of each primer and topcoat
as applied. 

The EPA is proposing that Method 24 be used for determining the VOC content. This is a long-standing method for such
determinations. Sources may, at their discretion, use manufacturer's data for determining the VOC content rather
than Method 24. However, if there is found to be a difference in the VOC content as determined from the manufacturer's
data and that determined using Method 24, then the value obtained using Method 24 will always take precedence in compliance
determinations. Since there are no generally available methods for testing organic HAP content, the EPA is proposing
that the organic HAP content level be determined by each facility based on the formulation of each coating. The formulation
data would be supplied to the facility by the coating manufacturer. This would reduce the burden to the industry and
promote consistent identification of the total organic HAP content among all users. Several coating manufacturers
have indicated to the EPA that they are willing to supply such information. 

As noted above, the proposed standards would require the organic HAP contents to be determined on a ``less water as
applied'' basis and VOC contents on a ``less water and exempt solvents as applied'' basis. Thus, unless the coating
is applied as received, procedures must be adopted to change ``as received'' organic HAP and VOC content levels to
``as applied'' levels. This could be accomplished by analyzing a sample of the coating as applied using Method 24 or
through a calculation. The calculations to do this are well known and established (see A Guideline for Surface Coating
Calculations, EPA-340/1-86-016, July 1986) and, thus, the EPA did not consider it necessary to
include the basic calculation formulas in the proposed rule. A determination of what is added to the coating before
it is applied must be made so that the ``as applied'' levels can be calculated. The EPA is proposing that each owner or
operator make such determinations on the basis of records kept at the facility. These are records that will be required
by the proposed rule and will be readily available to the owner or operator for making the necessary calculations.
The pertinent information (i.e., density, organic HAP content, and VOC content) of the additives would be based on
manufacturer supplied information. If that information is not available, then the owner or operator would be required
to develop a procedure for determining the missing information for approval by the Administrator.

<TEXT>
 

Since the proposed standards for organic HAP and VOC content levels would allow each owner or operator to average organic
HAP or VOC content levels across uncontrolled primers and across uncontrolled topcoats, the procedures provide
the necessary formulas to calculate the volume-weighted average organic HAP or VOC across all primers or topcoats.
For compliant coatings, the EPA is proposing less complicated procedures for demonstrating compliance. This is
appropriate because each coating by itself as applied meets the organic HAP (or VOC) content level, and daily calculations
of the volume-weighted average HAP and VOC content as applied are not necessary. The proposed rule does, however,
require monthly determination of usage and HAP and VOC content as applied. 

If control devices (e.g., incinerators, carbon adsorbers) are used, the proposed standards require them to achieve
an overall control efficiency of at least 81 percent. For control devices other than carbon adsorbers, it is necessary,
therefore, to identify the capture efficiency of the capture system, the destruction efficiency of the control device,
and, where feasible, operational parameters that would be monitored to ensure continuous compliance. The proposed
standards also include provisions for determining the capture and removal efficiencies. The test methods and procedures
being proposed for determining the capture and removal efficiencies are those that are typical for control devices.


The EPA is proposing that capture efficiency be determined by one of two methods depending on whether the capture system
is totally enclosed or not. A total enclosure would be verified according to the provisions specified in  52.741,
appendix B, Procedure T of 40 CFR part 52 (and, thus would have a capture efficiency of 100 percent). The capture efficiency
of all other systems would be determined according to the procedures specified in  52.741(a)(4)(iii) of 40
CFR part 52. 

The EPA is proposing that the removal efficiency of a control device be determined based on three runs, each run lasting
one hour. For control of organic compounds, Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, would be used
for selection of the sampling sites, and the gas volumetric flow rate would be determined using Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or
2D of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate. Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, would then be used to measure
either TOC minus methane and ethane or total organic HAP. Alternatively, any other test method or data that has been
validated according to the applicable procedures in Method 301 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, may be used. 

Where a carbon adsorber is used, the EPA is proposing to use a mass balance procedure for determining the overall control
efficiency. The proposed rule contains procedures as specified in 40 CFR 60.433 for using a mass balance approach
that would calculate the amount of organic HAP and VOC applied and the amount recovered. This information would then
be used to calculate the overall control efficiency of the carbon adsorber. 

In addition, Method 309 is being proposed for determining the number of consecutive 24-hour periods in the rolling
material balance period for carbon adsorbers. 

Each owner or operator using a control device would be required to conduct an initial performance test. For control
devices other than carbon adsorbers, this test would consist of 3 one-hour runs. For carbon adsorbers, the test would
span the number of days specified for the rolling material balance period as calculated by proposed Method 309. In
addition, it is necessary to establish, during the initial performance test, operating parameters that would be
continuously monitored in order to show continuous compliance. For incinerators other than catalytic incinerators,
the operating parameter would be the firebox temperature. For catalytic incinerators, the operating parameters
would be the temperature of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed. No operating parameters
are required to be monitored on carbon adsorbers since the material balance calculations provide a continuous check
of proper operation. 

c. 

Depainting operation.

 The proposed standards for the depainting of aerospace vehicles requires, in part, no organic HAP emissions, which
will be achieved through the use of chemical strippers that do not contain any organic HAP or the use of non-chemical
depainting methods or techniques. Since all of the known non-chemical depainting methods/techniques do not contain
any organic HAP, the only test method or procedures needed are those associated with determining whether a chemical
stripper contains any organic HAP. For the reasons noted earlier under the discussion on test methods for primers
and topcoats, the EPA is proposing that the organic HAP content be determined based on information supplied by the
manufacturer of the chemical stripper.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In order to demonstrate compliance with the organic HAP-containing chemical stripper usage limitation for spot
stripping and decal removal, the source must calculate an average annual usage per aircraft. Since there is only one
method to calculate this average (i.e., dividing the total gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper
used for spot stripping and decal removal by the number of aircraft stripped), the EPA is proposing to use this method
to determine compliance. The information needed for this calculation would be obtained from company records.
Particulate inorganic HAP emissions are generated by blast depainting methods. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
that Method 5 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, be used to determine the control efficiency of particulate filtration systems
used on this process.
d. 

Chemical milling maskant application operation. 

The proposed standards for chemical milling maskants limits the organic HAP content to the equivalent of 160 grams
per liter (1.3 pounds/gallon) less water as applied and limits the VOC content to the equivalent of 160 grams per liter
(1.3 pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents as applied. In determining compliance with the organic HAP
and VOC content levels, an owner or operator would have the flexibility to use compliant chemical milling maskants
or averaging uncontrolled compliant and non-compliant maskants. As for primers and topcoats, averaging uncontrolled
and controlled chemical milling maskants together would be prohibited. Test methods and procedures are, therefore,
necessary to determine the organic HAP and VOC content of each chemical milling maskant as applied. If control devices
are used, it is also necessary to determine the overall control efficiency of the control device. The test methods
selected and the rationale for the selection are identical to those presented above for primers and topcoats.
e. 

Handling and Storage of Waste. 

For those wastes subject to the proposed rule, no test methods or procedures are required to demonstrate compliance
with the proposed housekeeping measures.


2. Monitoring Requirements


In accordance with paragraph (a)(3) to section 114 of the Act, enhanced monitoring of stationary sources is required
to determine the compliance status of the sources, and whether compliance is continuous or intermittent. For affected
sources complying with the proposed standards through the use of control devices, initial compliance is determined
through the initial compliance test, and ongoing compliance through continuous monitoring. The EPA has proposed
the parameters to be monitored for certain types of control devices now used in the industry. The values of these parameters
that correspond to compliance with the proposed standards are set by the owner or operator during the initial compliance
test. If future monitoring indicates that control equipment is operating outside of the range of values established
during the initial performance test, then the owner or operator is out of compliance with the proposed standards,
except as specified for malfunctions in  63.6(e)(3) of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

10






a. 

Cleaning operation. 

For cleaning operations, the only portion of the standards for which monitoring requirements are being proposed
is for enclosed spray gun cleaner systems. These systems are stationary sources that have the potential to emit organic
HAP from around ill-fitting or worn seals or from leaking pumps or piping connections. The effectiveness of these
systems thus depends on their being ``vapor-tight'' and that there are no leaks from the pumps or piping of these systems.
Therefore, the EPA is proposing that such systems be visually inspected for leaks. Since most of the systems are used
to clean paint spray guns, leaks would be easily spotted by visual inspection as the result of solvent or paint residue
escaping around the source of the leak. The EPA does not believe that monitoring with leak detection equipment would
provide a significant increase, if any, in the detection of leaks from these systems. Therefore, the EPA is proposing
to require visual inspection only.
The EPA then considered how frequently the enclosed cleaners should be inspected. The EPA considered daily, weekly,
monthly, and yearly frequencies. The nature of the systems being inspected is not expected to result in sudden failure,
but rather failure due to wear and tear. Thus, the EPA considered it unnecessary to require daily or even weekly inspection.
On the other hand, one year was considered too long for a leak to go unrepaired. Therefore, the proposed standards would
require a monthly inspection of the systems. The EPA believes that this is a reasonable period between inspections,
without overburdening the industry and not allowing leaks to go unrepaired for an extended period of time.
Similarly, the proposed work practice and equipment standards require that containers used to store solvents and
solvent laden cloth and paper be closed when not in operation. The EPA could not identify any operating parameter that
would monitor whether this was being done. Nor could the EPA identify a parameter to monitor when atomized cleaning
is used. The proposed standards require the use of a device designed to capture the atomized solvent emissions. No
monitoring parameters were identified to indicate periods when the device may not be functioning or when it may have
been removed. Rather, the determination would be made during enforcement inspections as to whether the proper procedures
were being followed.
b. 

Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations. 

The proposed monitoring requirements for primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations
concern the operation of control devices that may be used in demonstrating compliance with the organic HAP content
levels. For control devices, the parameters to be monitored are those that have been typically used in other standards.
For example, where catalytic incinerators are used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions, the proposed standards
require that the temperature of the air stream be monitored immediately before and after the catalyst bed. The rationale
for selecting the various control device parameters in this proposed rule is long standing, and for more information
see the proposal notice for the SOCMI reactor processes NSPS (55 FR 26966 through 26969, June 29, 1990). The EPA is,
therefore, simply proposing to adopt the same monitoring parameters as have been required for previous standards.
For inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats, the proposed standards would require the use of particulate
filters or waterwash systems. Two parameters were identified that could be monitored that directly relate to the
performance of the system_air flow and pressure drop. The proposed rule, however, would require monitoring of only
the pressure drop across the filter or waterwash since the air flow is directly related to the pressure drop. Monitoring
of both parameters was considered to be redundant.
c. 

Depainting operation. 

The nature of the proposed standards for depainting operations is such that no meaningful monitoring requirement
was identified for the proposed organic HAP emission standards. The organic HAP content (less water as applied) of
the chemical strippers used must be calculated or determined. But once identified, there are no requirements concerning
their application.

<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The rationale for the pressure drop monitoring requirements proposed for inorganic HAP emissions from depainting
operations is identical to that for primers and topcoats.
d. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

For those wastes subject to the proposed rule, the EPA could not identify any operating parameters that would monitor
whether housekeeping measures were being performed. Therefore, no monitoring requirements are being proposed.


H. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements


1. Recordkeeping


In addition to the specific recordkeeping requirements described below for each affected source, the proposed rule
adopts the provisions specified in  63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart
A.

11

 These were the only paragraphs from  63.10 that were considered to be applicable to the proposed rule.




a. 

Cleaning operation. 

The proposed standards for hand-wipe cleaning operations require cleaning solvents to be used that either comply
with the approved composition list or have a composite vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F). In order to determine whether these requirements are being complied with, it is necessary to keep data on
the cleaning solvents being used in these operations. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator
keep for each cleaning solvent used at the facility, a record of the name of the cleaning solvent and documentation
that shows the organic HAP content and organic HAP constituents. In addition, the EPA is proposing the following records
for specific cleaning operations be kept.
For each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that conforms to the approved composition list,
the records that would be maintained are the name of each cleaning solvent, documentation demonstrating compliance
to the approved composition list, and annual purchasing records showing the annual volume purchased of each. For
each cleaning solvent used in hand-wipe cleaning operations that does not conform to the approved composition list,
but does conform to the vapor pressure requirement, the information required to be recorded would be the name of each
cleaning solvent, the monthly usage of the cleaning solvent at each operation, the composite vapor pressure, the
manufacturer's data sheets or other documentation of the vapor pressure, and any test reports and calculations performed
to determine the composite vapor pressure (in order to assess compliance with the vapor pressure limit).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed standards would allow certain hand-wipe cleaning operations to be exempt; that is, cleaning solvents
that do not comply with the approved composition requirements or with vapor pressure greater than 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F) can be used for these exempt cleaning operations. Therefore, affected facilities will have both compliant
and non-compliant cleaning solvents in use. The EPA, therefore, believes it is necessary to ensure that cleaning
solvents with vapor pressures greater than 45 mm Hg at 20 
 C (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F) are only used for the exempted cleaning operations. To this end, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator
keep daily records of the name and volume of each cleaning solvent used in each exempt hand-wipe cleaning operation,
as well as the parts, assemblies, or subassemblies on which it is used. The EPA is requiring daily recordkeeping for
these non-compliant solvents so that adequate records exist to determine that the solvents are used only in the exempt
operations.
The EPA is also proposing that records be kept of each leak found when visually inspecting enclosed spray gun systems.
These records would consist of source identification, the date of discovery of the leak, and the date of repair in order
to ensure that repairs are completed within 15 days as required by the proposed standard.
For those portions of the cleaning operation standards that require containers to be closed when not in use, the EPA
is not proposing any recordkeeping requirements. Nor is the EPA proposing any recordkeeping requirements for the
cleaning of spray guns (other than for enclosed spray gun cleaners) or flush cleaning.
b. 

Primer and topcoat application operations. 

For all primer and topcoat application operations, regardless of which methods are used to comply with the proposed
standards, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep records of the name of each coating and its organic
HAP and VOC content as received. In addition, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements
depending on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are being met. If an owner or operator is using compliant coatings
to meet the organic HAP or VOC content levels, the EPA is proposing that the owner or operator keep records that identify
for each coating (primer, topcoat) used each calendar month, the volume of each coating formulation used each month,
the masses of organic HAP and VOC emitted per unit volume as applied, and the manufacturer's data, calculations, and
test results (including Method 24 results taken during an enforcement inspection) used to determine organic HAP
and VOC content of each as applied. Daily records are not necessary since, if the coatings are compliant, the emissions
from the coatings will not exceed the emission limitation in the proposed standards on a daily basis. Monthly records,
however, are necessary to maintain a check that compliance is being maintained.
If an owner or operator elects to meet the organic HAP or VOC content level by averaging, the EPA is proposing that records
of the daily volume-weighted average organic HAP and VOC contents for primers and topcoats be kept as well as all of
the data and calculations used to calculate these values. This would include the volume, organic HAP content as applied,
and VOC content as applied of each coating. This level of information is required for an inspector to determine whether
the facility was in compliance and whether the proper data and calculations were being used.
If a control device is used, each owner or operator would be required to keep a record (or, where allowed in the proposed
standards, daily averages) of the various control device operating parameters being monitored. Since for some control
devices compliance with the proposed standards is dependent on the control device being operated properly, these
records are necessary to determine compliance. Specifically, a source would be out of compliance if the recorded
parameters were out of range. As noted earlier, for incinerators, this would be continuous records of the operating
temperature(s), while no operating parameters are required for carbon adsorbers. Thus, the EPA is requiring these
records for compliance determinations.

<TEXT>
 

The recordkeeping requirements for inorganic HAP emissions from primers and topcoats, which require recording
of the pressure drop across the filters or waterwash once per shift during which coating operations occur, were included
to provide a means of obtaining data that can be used to verify that the pressure drop limits are not being exceeded.
The records can also be used by the facility to determine when preventative maintenance should be performed on the
filter or waterwash system. The proposed rule would also require that the log include the pressure drop operating
range as specified by the manufacturer so that the compliance information is readily available at all times. 

c. 

Depainting operation. 

For compliance with the standard of no organic HAP emissions through the use of chemical strippers that contain no
organic HAP, the minimum records identified were the name of each chemical stripper used in depainting operations,
the organic HAP content of each stripper, and its supporting documentation. 

The proposed standards contain an exemption for spot stripping and decal removal that is based on an annual average
volume of organic HAP-containing stripper per aircraft. To ensure that this exemption is being complied with, the
EPA is proposing that the owner or operator of an affected source record these annual averages. Consequently, records
must be maintained of the number of aircraft depainted, the volume of organic HAP-containing stripper used for spot
stripping and decal removal, the average number of gallons of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper used per
aircraft, and all supporting data and calculations. 

Similarly, the proposed standards have an exemption for radomes and parts depainting. While radomes are self-evident,
the parts normally removed are not. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep an up-to-date
list of all aircraft depainted at the facility and a list of all parts normally removed prior to depainting from each
aircraft model. 

The EPA believes that it is necessary to ensure that, if a depainting facility uses organic HAP-containing chemical
strippers, they only be used on spot stripping, decal removal, radomes and parts. Tracking the daily use of the organic
HAP-containing chemical strippers by volume would indicate whether or not these strippers are being used on the aircraft
body. The amount of stripper required to depaint an aircraft body is substantially higher than for the exempted operations.
Therefore, an accounting of stripper usage is necessary to ensure organic HAP-containing stripper is not being used
on the aircraft body. The EPA considered requiring records of the usage of both strippers that contain organic HAP
and those that do not contain organic HAP be maintained. However, the EPA believes that requiring records of both types
of stripper usage would be overly burdensome to the industry and that adequate accounting would be obtained from the
usage of organic HAP-containing chemical stripper. In addition, records of the usage of organic HAP-containing
strippers are already being required for spot stripping and decal removal. Consequently, the EPA is proposing that
records be kept only of the organic HAP-containing chemical stripper usage. 

Daily recordkeeping of the usage of these strippers was considered to be unnecessary since the intent of the records
is to show long-term trends. Annual records, on the other hand, would require too long of a period to establish these
trends. Consequently, the EPA is requiring monthly records of the organic HAP-containing stripper usage. 

Whenever non-chemical depainting techniques are being used, the proposed standards would require that during periods
of malfunction, alternate depainting methods be used for no more than 14 consecutive days unless the alternative
method contains no organic HAP. In order to determine compliance with these requirements, records must be kept on
the dates the malfunction occurred and was corrected, the methods used to depaint the aerospace vehicles during the
malfunction, and the dates that these methods were begun and discontinued. 

For inorganic HAP emissions, records of the daily pressure drop readings are necessary to ensure that the requirements
of the proposed standards are being met. The rationale for this requirement is identical to that presented for primers
and topcoats. In addition, records must be maintained of the manufacturer's recommended pressure drop limits, the
particulate filter control efficiency, and all test results, data, and calculations used in determining the control
efficiency so that compliance determinations can be made.

d. 

Chemical milling maskant operation.

 For the organic HAP and VOC content levels, the EPA is proposing different levels of recordkeeping requirements depending
on how the organic HAP and VOC content levels are being met. The selection of and rationale for these recordkeeping
requirements are identical to those presented above for primers and topcoats. In addition, where carbon adsorbers
are used to control organic HAP and VOC emissions from chemical milling maskants, the same recordkeeping requirements
as discussed for primer and topcoat application operations are being proposed, and the rationale is the same. 

e. 

Handling and storage of waste. 

Since the proposed standards would exempt RCRA wastes, it is necessary to identify which wastes are subject to RCRA
and which are subject to the proposed rule. Therefore, the EPA is proposing that each owner or operator keep an up-to-date
list of which wastes are subject to RCRA requirements and which are subject to the proposed rule, and to keep on file
the documentation supporting these determinations. 

The EPA received a comment requesting that records be maintained of the quantity and type of solvents stored and disposed,
as well as the disposal facility (if applicable). The purpose of these records would be to ensure that the wastes are
not improperly disposed since the wastes may not be RCRA listed wastes (and, thus, not subject to applicable RCRA recordkeeping
requirements). The EPA is requesting additional comments concerning the addition of these recordkeeping requirements.
The comments should address whether there are any wastes that contain HAP that are not subject to RCRA and, if so, whether
the recordkeeping requirements under these standards should apply to all affected waste streams or only non-RCRA
listed waste streams. In addition, the comments should address what burden these requirements would impose. 



2. Reporting Requirements 



In addition to the specific reporting requirements described below for each affected source, the proposed rule adopts
the provisions specified in  63.9(a) through  63.9(e) and  63.9(h) through  63.9(j) and
 63.10 (a), (b), (d), and (f) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

12

 However, certain time periods specified in these sections were changed as detailed in Section II.F of this preamble.
These time periods were changed in order to provide additional time for the EPA to review requests for changes to time
periods for submittal of reports and for owners or operators to respond to EPA requests. These were the only paragraphs
from these sections (i.e.,  63.9 and  63.10) that were considered to be applicable to the proposed rule.





The proposed rule would require an owner or operator to submit the following four types of reports: 

(1) Initial notification, 
(2) Notification of compliance status, 
(3) Periodic reports, and 
(4) Other reports. 

The purpose and contents of each of these reports are described in this section. The wording of the proposed rule requires
all reports to be submitted to the ``Administrator.'' The term Administrator refers either to the Administrator
of the EPA, an EPA regional office, a state agency, or another authority that has been delegated the authority to implement
this rule. In most cases, reports will be sent to state agencies. Addresses are provided in the General Provisions
of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.

13

 





Records of reported information and other information necessary to document compliance with the regulation are
required to be kept for 5 years. Per the General Provisions, the 2 most recent years must be kept on-site; the other 3
years may be kept off-site. Records pertaining to the design and operation of the control and monitoring equipment
must be kept for the life of the equipment.

<TEXT>
 

a. 

Initial Notification.

 The proposed standards would require owners or operators who are subject to this subpart to submit an initial notification.
As outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR 63.9, this report serves two basic purposes: (1) Notifies the EPA that
an existing facility is subject to the proposed standards and (2) notifies the EPA of the construction of a new facility.

14

 A respondent must also report any facility modifications as defined in  63.5. This report will establish an
early dialogue between the source and the regulatory agency, allowing both to plan for compliance activities. The
notice is due no later than 12 months before the final compliance date as specified in the proposed standards. Under
the proposed rule, the initial notification is not required from any source that has submitted a permit application
under title V of the Act, provided that the permit application has been submitted by the same due dates as for the initial
notification and that the state to which the permit application has been submitted has a permit program in place and
has received delegation of authority from the EPA.
 




As called for by the General Provisions, each owner or operator of an affected source would be required to submit a start-up,
shut-down, and malfunction plan. This plan would be submitted with the initial notification. 

b. 

Notification of Compliance Status.

 As adopted through the General Provisions, owners or operators who are subject to this subpart would be required to
submit a notification of compliance status. This report contains the information necessary to demonstrate that
compliance has been achieved, such as the results of performance tests, Method 24 tests, and design analyses, as well
as the methods that will be used for determining continuing compliance as outlined in the General Provisions, 40 CFR
63.9.

15

 Another type of information to be included in the notification of compliance status is the specific range of each monitored
parameter for each affected source, the rationale for why this range indicates compliance with the emission standard,
and whether each source has operated within its designated operating parameters. The report would be due within 150
days after the final compliance date as specified in the General Provisions. 





Although not specified in the proposed rule, a description of information specific to the aerospace industry that
should be contained in the initial compliance notification for each of the affected sources was presented earlier
in this preamble (see Section II.B.2, Reporting Requirements). The information presented in that section is not
necessarily exhaustive. 

c. 

Periodic Reports.

 The EPA is proposing to adopt a standard basis for submitting periodic reports for each of the operations for which
standards are being proposed. Semiannual reports would be required whenever an operation was found to be in non-compliance
or whenever a monitored parameter exceeded its value. For example, for a primer application operation where averaging
is used, a semiannual report would be triggered for any daily period covered by the semiannual report in which the daily
primer volume-weighted average organic HAP content limit was exceeded. 

Semiannual reports would also be required whenever a change occurred at a facility that might affect a source's compliance
status or that introduces a new element to the operation that was required to be reported in the notification of compliance
status. For example, reformulation of a chemical milling maskant may change the organic HAP content of the maskant.
If the HAP content increases, then the owner or operator may have to average different or additional chemical milling
maskants together, or add a control device in order to maintain compliance. This change in compliance status would
trigger a semiannual report. 

For operations that did not experience any exceedances or changes, the EPA is proposing that annual reports be submitted
to this effect. In addition, annual reports are required where compliance is determined on an annual basis and exceedances
of these annual limits occur. 

The EPA is proposing to adopt the above schedule of reporting because it provides a fair balance between the need to
know certain information in a timely fashion and reduces the burden to industry and provides consistency within this
regulation. The following paragraphs discuss in more detail the specific types of information to be included in these
various periodic reports. The information being requested is that which the EPA believes is necessary in the enforcement
of the proposed rule.

<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) 

Cleaning operation.

 Periods of non-compliance would be transmitted to the EPA in a semiannual report. An example of non-compliance for
hand-wipe cleaning is the use of a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure greater than 45 mm Hg (24.1 in. H

2

O at 68 
 F) and does not conform to the approved composition list in a nonexempt cleaning operation. In addition, any
instance where a leaking enclosed spray gun cleaner is not repaired within 15 days would be considered an instance
of non-compliance that would trigger a semiannual report. 

The EPA is also proposing a semiannual reporting requirement if changes, such as the use of new cleaning solvents,
previously reported cleaning solvents no longer in use, or new cleaning techniques for spray guns, are made to the
cleaning operations at the facility. Where a new or reformulated cleaning solvent is used, the semiannual report
would include documentation of its vapor pressure or documentation that it conforms to the approved composition
list. 

If the cleaning operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required occurring
every 12 months from the date of the initial report stating that the cleaning operation has been in compliance with
the applicable standards. 

(2) 

Primer, topcoat, and chemical milling maskant application operations.

 A semiannual report would be required whenever an exceedance of organic HAP or VOC content levels occurred, as well
as any time a primer or topcoat application operation was not immediately shut down when the pressure drop across the
filters or waterwash was out of range. Where control devices are used to comply with the organic HAP or VOC content levels,
the EPA is also proposing to require semiannual reporting whenever a monitored parameter falls outside its appropriate
range. Such situations indicate noncompliance with the proposed standards. 

If no exceedances occur, each owner and operator would submit annual statements indicating that each affected facility
has been in compliance. The annual reports for primer and topcoat operations would also identify the number of times,
if any, the pressure drop limits for each filter or waterwash system were exceeded. 

(3) 

Depainting Operations.

 If new non-chemical depainting techniques are introduced to the facility since the filing of the notification of
compliance status or any subsequent semiannual report, the EPA is proposing semiannual reports to identify these
techniques. The semiannual report would be required to identify any period of malfunction of non-chemical depainting
methods and techniques and any period where the non-chemical depainting operation was not immediately shut down
when the pressure drop across the filters was out of range. 

For periods of malfunction of non-chemical depainting methods, semiannual reports would be required that identify
the method or technique that malfunctioned, the date that the malfunction occurred and was corrected, a description
of the malfunction, the alternative method(s) used for depainting during the period of malfunction, and the date(s)
that the methods were begun and discontinued. This information is necessary so that adequate documentation is available
to ascertain whether malfunctions were repaired within the 15 day limit. 

In addition, the facility would be required to report on a semiannual basis any new chemical strippers or changes to
existing formulations and the organic HAP content of each. A semiannual report would also be required for each 24-hour
period where organic HAP were emitted from the depainting operation, other than from spot, radome, or parts stripping
or decal removal. 

Finally, the semiannual report would be required to identify all changes in the type of aircraft depainted at the facility
and to identify the parts normally removed for depainting separate from the aircraft for each new type of aircraft
depainted. This is important because of the exemption being proposed for radomes and parts that are normally removed
prior to depainting the aircraft.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-1-00062 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-1-00008 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the depainting operation has been in compliance for the annual period, then an annual report would be required stating
that the depainting operation has been in compliance with the applicable standards. An annual report would also be
required whenever the calculated annual average volume of organic HAP-containing strippers used per aircraft for
spot stripping and decal removal exceeded the applicable limits. The annual report would also report the number of
times the pressure drop across the particulate filters used for the control of inorganic HAP emissions from non-chemical
depainting operations exceeded the limits specified by the manufacturer. 

(4) 

Handling and storage of waste.

 As discussed earlier, since an exemption exists for RCRA-regulated wastes, it is important to know which wastes are
subject to RCRA and which are not. Since facilities undergo change over time, it is possible that these designations
may change. Further, new waste streams may be created. Therefore, semiannual reports are being proposed to track
changes in the RCRA status of existing wastes and new wastes. An annual report would be required if no changes occurred
in the RCRA status to the existing waste streams and if no new waste streams were generated. 

d. 

Other Reports.

 The only ``other reports'' in the proposed rule are those that are required under the General Provisions, subpart
A of 40 CFR part 63.

16

 Of particular note is the report required in response to periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. When the procedures
used during such periods are completely consistent with the plan, a report stating such is to be delivered or postmarked
by the thirtieth (30th) day following the end of each calendar half. If the procedures are not completely consistent
with the plan, an owner or operator is to report the actions taken within 2 working days after commencing actions inconsistent
with the plan, followed by a letter within 7 working days after the end of the event. The EPA is proposing that for non-chemical
depainting malfunctions only, that the owner or operator report any plan inconsistency for dealing with the malfunction
within 24 hours after the inconsistent depainting technique is actually utilized. This is different from ``after
the end of the event'' because owners or operators may be able to adjust their depainting schedule to accommodate the
time to repair a malfunction without the need to implement their malfunction plan. 





I. Selection of Compliance Deadlines 



The EPA proposes to allow affected sources the following time periods after promulgation for compliance, as provided
for in section 112(i) of the Act. All sources, whether uncontrolled or having in place control systems or measures
requiring upgrading to meet the new rule, would be required to reach full compliance within 3 years after promulgation
of the rule. In addition, all affected sources must comply with the compliance dates specified in  63.6 (b) and
(c) of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, 
subpart A.

17

 





The EPA considered requiring earlier compliance to some parts of the proposed standards. However, comments received
from state agencies indicated that there would be far less burden enforcing the standards if there was a single compliance
date. Multiple compliance dates would make it difficult for agencies in states with numerous sources to keep track
of which standards applied to each facility and when compliance would have to begin. 

The EPA recognizes the need for the full three-year period for facilities to come into compliance due to the nature
of testing and qualification necessary for sources such as hand-wipe cleaning solvents, primers, topcoats, and
chemical milling maskants. For all these reasons, the EPA is proposing that all sources be allowed up to three years
after the date of promulgation of the rule to achieve compliance. 

The EPA is requesting comments, however, concerning alternative compliance dates for certain pollution prevention
and housekeeping measures. Specifically, the EPA is considering a compliance date of 90 days after the effective
date of the proposed standards for the cleaning operation housekeeping measures in  63.744(a) of the proposed
rule, the use of enclosed containers for flush cleaning solvents in  63.744(d), and the provisions for handling
and storage of waste in  63.748. The EPA is also considering a compliance date of 180 days after the effective
date of the proposed standards for the spray gun cleaning provisions in  63.744(c).

J. Operating Permit Program 


Under 40 CFR part 70, all major sources of HAP will be required to obtain an operating permit. Emission limits, monitoring,
and reporting and recordkeeping requirements are typically scattered among numerous provisions of State implementation
plans (SIP's) or Federal regulations. As discussed in the rule for the operating permit program, this new permit program
would include in a single document all of the requirements that pertain to a single source. Once a state's permit program
has been approved, each aerospace facility that is a major source within that state must apply for and obtain an operating
permit. If the state wherein the aerospace facility is located does not have an approved permitting program, the owner
or operator of an aerospace facility must submit a part 71 permit application if requested under 40 CFR part 71. 


K. Solicitation of Comments 


The Administrator welcomes comments from interested persons on any aspect of the proposed standards, and on any statement
in the preamble or the referenced supporting documents. 
The proposed standards were developed on the basis of information available. The Administrator is specifically
requesting factual information that may support either the approach taken in the proposed standards or an alternate
approach. To receive proper consideration, documentation or data should be provided. 


VI. Administrative Requirements 


A. Public Hearing 


A public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed standards in accordance with section 307(d)(5)
of the Act. Persons wishing to make an oral presentation on the proposed standards for aerospace manufacturing and
rework should contact the EPA at the address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limited to 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a
written statement before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statements should be addressed to
the Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center address given in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble, and should refer to Docket No. A-92-20. 
A verbatim transcript of the hearing and any written statements will be available for public inspection and copying
during normal working hours at the EPA's Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center in Washington, DC (see 

ADDRESSES

 section of this preamble). 


B. Docket 


The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by the EPA
in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested
parties to readily identify and locate documents so that they can intelligently and effectively participate in the
rulemaking process, and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review materials)
(section 307(d)(7)(A) of the Act). 


C. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 61736 (October 4, 1993)), the EPA must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribunal
governments or communities, 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency,

(3) Materially affect the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and
obligations of recipients thereof, or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, OMB has made the determination that this action is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' within the meaning of the Executive Order. For this reason, this action was not submitted to OMB
for review. 


D. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA
(ICR No. 1687.01) and a copy may be obtained from Ms. Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M St., SW, (2136),
Washington, DC 20460 or by calling (202) 260-2740. 
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 366 hours per respondent for
the first year after the date of promulgation of the rule, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, 2136, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention:
Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection
requirements contained in this proposal. 


E. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations
on small ``entities.'' Since the proposed rule applies only to major sources as defined in section 112(a) of the Act,
the EPA certifies that there would not be a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Consequently,
a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 


F. Clean Air Act Section 117 


In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate
advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comment
on all aspects of the proposed regulation, including health, economic, technological, or other aspects. 


G. Regulatory Review 


In accordance with sections 112(d)(6) and 112(f)(2) of the Act, this regulation will be reviewed within 8 years from
the date of promulgation. This review may include an assessment of such factors as evaluation of the residual health
risk, any overlap with other programs, the existence of alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission
control technology and health data, and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 


List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 63 


Air pollution control, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.




VII. Statutory Authority 


The statutory authority for this proposal is provided by sections 101, 112, 114, 116, and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as
amended; 42 U.S.C., 7401, 7412, 7414, 7416, and 7601.

Copper Monochlorophthalocyanine Pigment; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-To-Know 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to grant a petition to delete Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the ``copper compounds'' category
of the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA). C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper
monochlorophthalocyanine. C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds'';
therefore, the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the
chemical category ``copper compounds.'' This proposed rule is based on EPA's belief that the copper ion from copper
monochlorophthalocyanine will not become available. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative of exempting
all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine from the
reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category in EPCRA section 313. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction 


A. Statutory Authority


This proposed rule is issued under section 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99-499). 


B. Background


Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities must also report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic
chemicals that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA
to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e)(1),
any person may petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added and deleted chemicals
from the original statutory list.
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued a statement of policy and guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions
to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories. Pursuant to EPCRA section 313(e)(1),
EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation of
why the petition has been denied. 


II. Description of Petition


On March 5, 1993, the Agency received a petition from the Color Pigments Manufacturers Association (CPMA) to delete
Color Index (C.I.) Pigment Blue 15:1 from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' subject to EPCRA reporting
requirements. C.I. Pigment Blue 15:1 is a mixture of C.I. Pigment Blue 15 (copper phthalocyanine) and copper monochlorophthalocyanine.
C.I. Pigment Blue 15 has already been deleted from the chemical category ``copper compounds'' (56 FR 23650); therefore,
the Agency is treating this petition as a request to remove copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the chemical category
``copper compounds.'' 
The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment, which is the subject of this petition, exists as two isomers. One isomer
is substituted with a single chlorine atom at the 1-position. The second isomer is substituted with a single chlorine
atom at the 2-position. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment is described by three CAS numbers. CAS number
15975-60-7 describes the copper 1-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 147-13-7 describes
the copper 2-chlorophthalocyanine pigment. CAS number 12239-87-1 describes the copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigment with the position of a single chlorine atom unspecified. EPA is proposing to delete both isomers and hence
all three CAS numbers from the copper compounds category. 
In the statement of policy and guidance on the metal compound categories of section 313 of EPCRA (56 FR 23703, May 23,
1991), EPA articulated the view that the toxicity of a metal-containing compound that dissociates or reacts to generate
the metal ion can be expressed as a function of the toxicity induced by the intact species and the availability of the
metal ion. Therefore, the degree of dissociation, bioaccumulation, and the level at which toxicity is induced by
the metal ion will be considered in making any delisting decision under EPCRA section 313. Thus, for petitions to exempt
individual metal-containing compounds from the reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313, EPA has decided
to base its decisions on the evaluation of all chemical and biological processes that may lead to metal ion availability
as well as on the toxicity of the intact species. These decisions will continue to be based on information provided
by the petitioner, Agency documents, and available literature. EPCRA section 313(d)(3) requires EPA to determine
that none of the criteria in EPCRA section 313(d)(2) are met before a chemical may be deleted from the EPCRA section
313 list. Under the policy for metal compound categories, this means that the effects induced by both a metal ion and
the intact species described by the metal compound category must be considered in light of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)
criteria. The effects induced by each metal ion described by the metal compound categories meet the criteria under
EPCRA section 313(d)(2). To delete a metal compound from the EPCRA section 313 list, EPA must conclude that the metal
ion will not become available at a level that can be expected to induce toxicity of a type described in EPCRA section
313(d)(2), and that the intact species does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). Accordingly, EPA will
generally deny petitions to delete chemicals if: (1) The intact species meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria,
(2) the chemical will dissociate or react to generate the metal ion at levels which can reasonably be anticipated to
cause adverse effects as described in EPCRA section 313(d)(2), or (3) EPA does not possess and the petitioners failed
to provide information to properly characterize the metal ion availability. 


III. Technical Review 


The Agency has previously addressed the transformation processes that may generate copper ion from copper phthalocyanine
compounds in its review of a petition to delete three copper phthalocyanine pigments (Pigment Blue 15, copper phthalocyanine;
Pigment Green 7, copper poly(14)chlorophthalocyanine; and Pigment Green 36, copper hexabromodecachlorophthalocyanine)
from EPCRA section 313 reporting requirements. These three copper phthalocyanine pigments were deleted from EPCRA
section 313 on May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23650), because copper ion could not reasonably be expected to become available from
these pigments and because there was no indication from the available data that the intact pigments could reasonably
be anticipated to cause acute, chronic, or environmental toxicity. No data on the specific copper monochlorophthalocyanine
compounds which are the subject of this petition were found. However, in its analysis of the three previously deleted
compounds, the Agency used data on both brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine and copper phthalocyanine.
This information was selected because Pigment Blue 15, Pigment Green 7, and Pigment Green 36 ranged in degree of bromination/chlorination
from zero (Pigment Blue 15) to 100 percent (Pigment Green 36). The transformation potential of many organic compounds
is dependent, in part, on the number of bromine or chlorine atoms present in the molecule. Although there are exceptions,
generally, the more highly brominated or chlorinated an organic compound is, the less likely it is to undergo biotic
or abiotic transformations. Once the transformation potential for copper phthalocyanine pigments at the extremes
of the range of possible bromination/chlorination had been assessed, the transformation potential for those copper
phthalocyanine pigments with bromination/chlorination greater than zero and less than 100 percent, including
copper monochlorophthalocyanine, could be inferred. The transformation processes reviewed included, hydrolysis,
photolysis, abiotic and biotic aerobic degradation, abiotic and biotic anaerobic degradation, bioavailability
of the ion when the compounds are ingested or inhaled, and bioaccumulation. The following discussion summarizes
the information reviewed.
1. 

Copper ion

 (Refs. 2 and 7). Copper is recognized as an essential element. It is essential to a number of normal physiological processes
including erythropoiesis, connective tissue metabolism, bone development, and nervous system function. The National
Academy of Sciences' recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 2.0 to 3.0 milligrams (mg) copper/day. Copper
is also used as a hematinic (to stimulate red blood cell production) in adults at a dose of 3.8 to 7.6 mg/day.
a. 

Human health effects

. Copper poisoning has been demonstrated in animals and identified in humans. The liver is the main storage depot for
copper, and hepatic damage is associated with the accumulation of high levels of copper. Hepatic toxicity is characterized
by hepatocellular necrosis, regenerative activity, and cirrhosis. Kidney necrosis and elevated levels of serum
copper occur only after the liver begins to accumulate high levels of copper. These elevated serum copper levels can
progress to sudden hemolytic anemia and jaundice.
The types of neurological effects associated with copper poisoning can include demyelination and cerebral degeneration.
These effects are thought to be related to defects in catecholamine metabolism. Alterations in brain neurotransmitter
systems have been observed in rats following intraperitoneal injections of 2 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day)
for 21 days. There are two groups that are at a particularly increased risk from copper exposure. These include individuals
with Wilson's disease, which is an inborn error in copper metabolism. The metabolic error in Wilson's disease allows
copper to accumulate in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea, causing hemolytic anemia, neurological abnormalities,
and corneal opacity. In addition, individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiencies may also be
at greater risk of experiencing toxic effects from copper exposure.
Copper is classified in EPA's Group D (insufficient data) for carcinogenic potential. Copper is generally negative
in mutagenicity bioassays. Oral bioassays using copper were negative; subcutaneous injection of copper compounds
has been reported to induce tumor formation in one sex and strain of mice.
The maximum contaminant level (MCL) established for copper under the Safe Drinking Water Act is 1.3 milligrams/liter
(mg/L) (3.6 mg/day).
b. 

Ecological effects

. Copper is very toxic to aquatic life. It is sometimes used as a biocide to control undesirable aquatic plants. EPA
has issued Water Quality Criteria for copper to protect aquatic life. The acute criterion in fresh water at a hardness
of 50 mg/L is 9.2 micrograms/liter (ug/L). The chronic criterion in fresh water is 6.5 ug/L at a hardness of 50 mg/L.
In salt water at a hardness of 50 mg/L, the acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L. At a hardness of 100 mg/L, the freshwater acute
criterion is 18 ug/L, the freshwater chronic criterion is 12 ug/L, and the salt water acute criterion is 2.9 ug/L.
2. 

Availability of copper ion

. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are expected to be extremely stable to chemically and biologically
induced transformations.
a. 

Thermal stability

. Based on their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments are expected to be extremely stable thermally. Copper phthalocyanine pigments only begin to show signs
of decomposition at temperatures above 500 
 C (Ref. 6).
b. 

Hydrolysis

. Copper phthalocyanine pigments have very low solubilities in water and are not expected to dissociate or hydrolyze
in water under environmental conditions. Hydrolysis of copper phthalocyanine pigments does not occur in basic and
nonoxidizing acidic media (Ref. 3). By structural analogy to copper phthalocyanine pigments for which data are available,
hydrolysis of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments is not expected to be a significant environmental transformation
process.
c. 

Photolysis

. Based on studies carried out to determine the light fastness of structurally similar copper phthalocyanine pigments,
it appears that photolysis of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments with resultant release of copper ion will
not occur (Ref. 4).
d. 

Abiotic oxidation

. Data indicate that under ambient environmental conditions, abiotic oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments
does not occur. More rigorous conditions are required to effect the oxidation of copper phthalocyanine pigments
and subsequent release of copper ion. These pigments can be chemically oxidized to yield phthalimides and copper
nitrate by boiling in dilute nitric acid (Ref. 3). Oxidation of the pigments can also occur by treatment with ceric
sulfate in dilute sulfuric acid at 25 
 C, or by reaction with potassium permanganate (Ref. 1). Because rigorous conditions are required to oxidize
copper phthalocyanine pigments, abiotic oxidation of copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments under ambient
environmental conditions is not likely to occur.
e. 

Microbial transformations

. No data on the anaerobic or aerobic biodegradability of the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments were found.
However, based on their extremely low solubility in water, their large cross-sectional diameter, and, with the exception
of the chlorine, the lack of substituent groups associated with facile primary degradation, copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments are expected to be very resistant to degradation processes (Ref. 5).
f. 

Bioavailability

. On the basis of molecular weight, extremely low solubility in water, and data from subchronic toxicity tests on other
copper phthalocyanine pigments (Ref. 7), copper monochlorophthalocyanine is not expected to be appreciably absorbed
by any route of exposure or metabolized to yield copper ion.
g. 

Bioaccumulation

. Because copper ion does not appear to be available from the copper phthalocyanine pigments, bioaccumulation of
copper ion is not a concern for copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments. 
h. 

Summary.

 By virtue of their structural analogy to other copper phthalocyanine pigments, EPA believes that the availability
of copper ion from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments by hydrolysis, photolysis, and aerobic and anaerobic
transformations is negligible. Copper ion is not expected to be bioavailable from the copper monochlorophthalocyanine
pigments. The copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigments are not expected to be appreciably absorbed by any route
of exposure or metabolized to yield the copper ion. 
3. 

Manufacturing, use, and release

. Phthalocyanine blue pigments, such as copper monochlorophthalocyanine, are generally manufactured using one
of two methods. Copper monochlorophthalocyanine is manufactured by a phthalonitrile baking process or a solvent
process. The phthalonitrile baking process yields a range of 70 to 85 percent of product. The solvent process is more
popular and yields a purer form with a yield of 85 to 95 percent of product. Following the synthesis the crude product
is isolated. Finishing of the crude pigment can involve any of a number of processes such as dissolution in acid followed
by controlled precipitation, intensive milling with urea and sulfuric acid, milling with sodium chloride, or milling
with sodium chloride and solvent. 
Copper monochlorophthlocyanine is often used in combination with other colorants. The primary uses of copper monochlorophthalocyanine
mixtures are as colorants for coatings, paints, printing inks, and plastics. 
The EPCRA section 313 reported releases of copper from three facilities which were identified as manufacturers of
copper monochlorophthalocyanine were 2,354 pounds in 1990 and 491 pounds for 1991. Facilities that process or use
copper monochlorophthalocyanine pigment could not be identified and therefore releases from these facilities
could not be estimated. 


IV. Explanation for Proposed Action To Delete Copper Monochlorophthalocyanine 


EPA is granting the petition and proposing to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the copper compounds
category of the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. As stated in Unit II. of this preamble, petitions for delisting
a member of a metal compound category will be denied unless EPA can conclude that the intact species does not meet the
criteria of section 313(d)(2) and the metal ion will not be available at a level that can reasonably be anticipated
to induce toxicity. This decision to propose to delist copper monochlorophthalocyanine is based on EPA's belief
that: (1) The intact species does not meet the EPCRA section 313(d) criteria and (2) the copper ion from copper monochlorophthalocyanine
will not become available. After reviewing the petition and available information, EPA has concluded that copper
monochlorophthalocyanine is not known to cause or cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause acute or chronic toxicity
in humans or adverse effects in the environment, and thus does not meet the criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2). 


V. Request for Public Comment 


EPA requests public comment on this proposed rule to delete copper monochlorophthalocyanine from the category ``copper
compounds'' on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. In addition, EPA requests comment on the alternative
of exempting all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine
from the reporting requirements under the ``copper compounds'' category on the EPCRA section 313 list. As stated
in Unit III. of this preamble, EPA has previously reviewed brominated/chlorinated copper phthalocyanine compounds
as well as the parent compound, copper phthalocyanine, and believes that its conclusions regarding the availability
of soluble copper from these compounds apply to all copper phthalocyanine compounds that are substituted with only
hydrogen and/or bromine or chlorine. Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the ADDRESSES unit.
All comments must be received by EPA on or before August 5, 1994. 


VI. Rulemaking Record 


The record supporting this proposed rule is contained in docket number OPPTS-400085. All documents, including
an index of the docket, are available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), also known as, TSCA Public
Docket Office from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. TSCA NCIC is located at EPA Headquarters,
Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether
a substantial number of small entities would be significantly affected by the proposed rule. Because the proposed
rule eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


This proposed rule does not have any information collection requirements subject to the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.

Aromatic Amino Ether; Proposed Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as an aromatic amino ether which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P-90-1840 and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This proposal
would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a
use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to
evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P-90-1840 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would
provide EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. 


I. Authority



Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.

Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under
section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action,
section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 

Federal Register

 its reasons for not taking action.

Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. 

II. Applicability of General Provisions



General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed
in detail in that 

Federal Register

 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 


III. Background



EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P-90-1840 and
a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the 

Federal Register

 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672). EPA received adverse comments following publication for this chemical substance.
Therefore, as required by  721.160, the final SNUR for P-90-1840 is being withdrawn elsewhere in
this issue of the 

Federal Register

 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued.

EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any of the other SNURs that were published in the October 4,
1993, 

Federal Register

 because those rules became final effective rules on December 3, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in a separate
action. The supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct
final SNUR for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.



IV. Substance Subject to This Rule



EPA is proposing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance under
40 CFR part 721. 


PMN Number P-90-1840 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Aromatic amino ether. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:

 November 5, 1992. 

Basis for section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health and the environment. 


Toxicity concern:

 The PMN substance and similar chemicals have been shown to cause mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity
(retinopathy), hepatotoxicity, reproductive effects, and aquatic toxicity at concentrations as low as 1 ppb (part
per billion) in test animals. 


Recommended testing:

 A 90-day subchronic rodent study (oral or inhalation route) with special attention given to hepatotoxicity,
histopathological exam of the male and female reproductive organs, and retinopathy is needed to help characterize
the neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, and reproductive effects of the PMN substance. The 90-day study must also include
for each treatment group a satellite group of exposed animals to be retained for an additional 90-day recovery
period to evaluate the possible reversibility of retinopathy. Light and electron microscopy should be utilized
to examine the ocular tissue (40 CFR 798.2650, modified). A 2-year two-species bioassay (40 CFR 798.3300) is
also necessary to characterize the carcinogenic potential of the PMN substance. The consent order contains two production
volume limits. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed the first production limit without performing the 90-day
subchronic study. The PMN submitter has also agreed not to exceed the second, higher production volume limit without
performing the 2-year, two-species bioassay. In addition, an early life stage toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1600),
a 

Daphnia

 chronic toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1330), an algal acute toxicity study (40 CFR 797.1050), and a coupled units test
(40 CFR 796.3300) would characterize the potential aquatic toxicity effects. 


CFR citation:

 40 CFR 721.3390. 


V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 


EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on October
4, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after October 4, 1993, will have to cease
any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at  721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.



VI. Economic Analysis 


EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged
for the substance in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this proposed rule (OPPTS-50612B). 


VII. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information




Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 


VIII. Rulemaking Record



EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS-50612B). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.

EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. 



A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC),
also known as, TSCA Public Docket Office, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. NCIC
is located in Rm. E-G102, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 



IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's prioritities, or the principles set forth in
this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this proposed rule is
not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act



OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012.

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposed rule.

Therefore, it is proposed that 40 CFR part 721 be amended as follows: 


PART 721_[AMENDED] 




1. The authority citation for part 721 would continue to read as follows: 




Authority:

 15 U.S.C. 2604, 2607, and 2625(c).



2. By adding new  721.1640 to subpart E to read as follows: 


 721.1640

 Aromatic amino ether. 


(a) 

Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.

 (1) The chemical substance identified generically as aromatic amino ether (PMN P-90-1840) is subject
to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements
of this section do not apply once the substance has been incorporated into a final product with residual monomer 50
ppm (parts per million) by weight. 
(2) The significant new uses are: 
(i) 

Protection in the workplace.

 Requirements as specified in  721.63(a)(1), (a)(2)(i), (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5)(i),
(a)(6)(i), (b)(concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c). The demonstration of an impervious barrier for gloves
required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section will require testing of the gloves as follows. There must be no permeation
of the PMN substance greater than 2 ppm after 8 h of testing in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) F739 ``Standard Test Method for Resistance of Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation By Liquids and
Gases'' and ASTM F1194 ``Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation Testing of Protective Clothing
Materials.'' The employer must submit all test data to the Agency and must receive the Agency's written approval of
the test results for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves. Gloves may not be used for a time period longer
than they are actually tested and must be replaced at the end of the work shift. As an alternative to the respiratory
requirements in this section, manufacturers, importers, and processors may use the new chemical exposure limits
provisions, including sampling and analytical methods which have previously been approved by EPA for this substance,
found in the 5(e) consent order for this substance. (ii) 

Hazard communication program.

 Requirements as specified in  721.72(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), (f), (g)(1)(vi),
(g)(1)(vii), (g)(2)(i), (g)(2)(ii), (g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv), (g)(2)(v), (g)(3)(i), (g)(3)(ii), (g)(4), and
(g)(5). The following additional statements shall appear on each label and MSDS as required by this paragraph: This
substance may cause liver damage. This substance may cause retinopathy.

(iii) 

Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.

 Requirements as specified in  721.80(l) and (q). 
(iv) 

Release to water.

 Requirements as specified in  721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) (where N = 1 ppb). When calculating the surface
water concentrations according to the instructions in  721.91(a)(4), the statement that the amount of the
substance that will be released will be calculated before the substance enters control technology does not apply.
Instead, if the waste stream containing the PMN substance will be treated before release, the amount of the PMN substance
reasonably likely to be removed from the waste stream by treatment may be subtracted in calculating the number of kilograms
released. No more than 45 percent removal efficiency may be attributed to such treatment. 
(b) 

Specific requirements.

 The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph.

(1)

Substituted Ethylenediamine, Methyl Sulfate Quaternized; Revocation of a Significant New Use Rule 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to revoke a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA) for substituted ethylenediamine, methyl sulfate quaternized, based on receipt of new data. The
data indicate that for purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk to the environment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA issued a SNUR establishing significant new uses for substituted ethylenediamine,
methyl sulfate quaternized. Because of additional data EPA has received for this substance, EPA is proposing to revoke
this SNUR. 


I. Proposed Revocation 


EPA is proposing to revoke the significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance
under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for the substance, including its PMN
number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the
revocation of the section 5(e) consent order for the substance, and the CFR citation removed in the regulatory text
section of this proposed rule. Further background information for the substance is contained in the rulemaking record
referenced below in Unit IV. of this preamble. 



PMN Number P-89-650 




Chemical name:

 (generic) Substituted ethylenediamine, methyl sulfate quaternized. 


CAS number:

 Not available. 


Effective date of revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 July 28, 1993. 


Basis for revocation of section 5(e) consent order:

 The order was revoked based on test data submitted under the terms of the consent order. Based on the Agency's analysis
of the submitted data, EPA has sufficient information to determine, for purposes of TSCA section 5, that the manufacture,
processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the PMN substance will not present an unreasonable risk
to the environment. Accordingly, EPA has determined that further regulation under section 5(e) is not warranted
at this time. 


Toxicity testing results:

 Algal toxicity study: 96-h EC50 = 320.0 mg/L 
Daphnid acute toxicity study: 48-h NEC = 390.0 mg/L 
Fish acute toxicity study: 96-h NOEC = 1,000.0 mg/L


CFR citation: 40 CFR 721.3580. 



II. Objectives and Rationale for Proposed Revocation of the Rule 



During review of the PMN submitted for the chemical substance that is the subject of this proposed revocation, EPA
concluded that regulation was warranted under section 5(e) of TSCA pending the development of information sufficient
to make a reasoned evaluation of the environmental effects of the substance, and that the substance is expected to
be produced in substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial environmental exposure. EPA identified
the tests necessary to make a reasoned evaluation of the risks posed by the substance to the environment. Based on these
findings, a section 5(e) consent order was negotiated with the PMN submitter and a SNUR was promulgated. 
EPA reviewed testing conducted by the PMN submitter pursuant to the consent order for the substance and determined
that the information available was sufficient to make a reasoned evaluation of the environmental effects of the substance.
EPA concluded that, for the purposes of TSCA section 5, the substance will not present an unreasonable risk and consequently
revoked the section 5(e) consent order. The proposed revocation of SNUR provisions for this substance designated
herein is consistent with the revocation of the section 5(e) order. In light of the above, EPA is proposing a revocation
of SNUR provisions for this chemical substance. When this revocation becomes final, EPA will no longer require notice
of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process this substance. In addition, export notification under
section 12(b) of TSCA will no longer be required. 



III. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information 


Any person who submits comments claimed as confidential business information must mark the comments as ``confidential,''
``trade secret,'' or other appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission
will be placed in the public file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures
in 40 CFR part 2. Any party submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a public version
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 



IV. Rulemaking Record 



The record for the rule which EPA is proposing to revoke was established at OPPTS-50575 (P-89-650).
This record includes information considered by the Agency in developing the rule and includes the test data that formed
the basis for this proposal.



V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


EPA is proposing to revoke the requirements of the rule. Any costs or burdens associated with the rule will be eliminated
when the rule is revoked. Therefore, EPA finds that no costs or burdens must be assessed under Executive Order 12866,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), or the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations concerning safety standards for self-propelled vessels carrying
bulk liquefied gases. These amendments are necessary because the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Code
on which many of these regulations are based has been amended. This proposal would make the changes necessary to align
these regulations with the IMO Code and to clarify certain provisions in the existing regulations.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Requests for Comments 



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
82-058) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each
comment. The Coast Guard requests that two copies of all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format,
no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgement of
receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. 

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments. 

The Coast Guard plan no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ADDRESSES.

 The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coat Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by a
later notice in the 

Federal Register.

 



Dafting Information 


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Mr. Thomas J. Felleisen, Project Manager, and Mr. Stephen
H. Barber, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel. 



Background and Purpose 



On November 12, 1975, the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (now the International Maritime
Organization or IMO) adopted the ``Code for Construction and Equipment of Ships Carring Liquefied Gases in Bulk''
(Gas Carrier Code), Resolution, A.328 (IX) without amendments. Coast Guard regulations based on this code were put
into effect May 3, 1979 (44 25986), Since 1975, the Gas Carrier Code has been amended four times: April 19, 1978 (see
Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) XXXVIII/22), May 8, 1979 (see MSC XL/26), May 20, 1980 (see MSC/Cir. 284), and June
14, 1983 (see MSC/Cir. 356). 

IMO's amendments to the Gas Carrier Code include corrections and clarifications, incorporation of standards for
new or novel containment systems, improvement of the carriage requirements for several of the more hazardous cargoes,
expansion of the list of chemicals to which the code applies, and revisions to align the Gas Carrier Code with the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk'' (IBC) and the ``International
Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefield Gases in Bulk'' (IGC). 

These amendments were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicals, the body responsible for maintenance
of the Code. The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of these changes to the Gas Carrier Code by submitting
position papers when the amendments were proposed. This rulemaking would revise the Coast Guard regulations in 46
CFR part 154 to reflect these amendments. 

One of the most notable revisions would be the inclusion of standards for internal insulation tanks in new   154.454
through 154.458, as well as in several existing sections. These standards would be included in order to bring the U.S.
regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with the Gas Carrier Code. 

Part 154 would be revised to include carriage requirements for seven cargoes previously regulated only under 46 CFR
part 153. The cargoes are diethly ether, a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide containing not more than 30%
ethylene oxide, isoprene, isopropylamine, monoethyamine, propylene oxide, vinyl ethyl ether, and vinylidene
chloride. These cargoes are being added in order to bring the U.S. regulations for liquefied gas vessels in line with
the Gas Carrier Code.

Several sections of part 154 would be revised to clarify misinterpreted provisions. These are in   154.630,
154.901, 154.1831, 154.1832, and 154.1834. See ``Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes'' for the
details of each clarification.



Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes



The following is a section by section explanation of the proposed changes.

1. 46 CFR part 40 would be removed. See the discussion in this section of the preamble on  154.1745.

2. Existing  154.1, Incorporation by reference, would be moved to new  154.8 and revised to conform to
current formatting practices.

3. The following sections would be revised to include requirements from the amended Gas Carrier Code applicable to
internal insulation tanks:   154.7, 154.235, 154.350, 154.454 through 154.459, 154.468, 154.615,
and 154.902.

4. The following sections would be revised to update references to other sections of this chapter and to incorporated
material and to correct spelling errors:   154.12, 154.15, 154.151, 154.174, 154.176, 154.188, 154.195,
154.420, 154.439, 154.440, 154.448, 154.471, 154,1005, 154.1020, 154.1115, 154.1135, 154.1735, 154.1800, 154.1803,
and 154.1820.

5. Section 154.19 would be revised to refer to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying
Liquefied Gases in Bulk and to correct the date on the Gas Carrier Code for Existing Ships. The correct date is 1976.

6. Section 154.170 would be revised in accordance with an amendment to the Gas Carrier Code which sets the design temperature
of the primary and secondary cargo tank barriers. Also, paragraph (a) would be revised to comply with present procedures
for incorporating material by reference.

7. Table 1 ( 154.172) would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by including higher tensile steel
grades AH, DH, and EH for vessels designed for prolonged exposure to low service temperatures. The revisions to this
table also would allow the use of grade A steel for design temperatures of down to ^5 
 C for thicknesses of up to 15mm. The reference in the table to an American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) standard would
be updated.

8. Section 154.300 would be revised to allow category A machinery spaces, for example spaces for bow thruster machinery,
to be located forward of hold spaces if specially approved by the Commandant (G-MTH). 

9. Section 154.315 would be revised to allow the Coast Guard to accept arrangements where the cargo pump room or cargo
compressor room is located outside of the cargo area, as ``cargo area'' is defined in  154.7, if the limits of
the cargo area are extended to include the cargo pump or compressor room and the areas below those spaces. The Coast
Guard has accepted these arrangements in the past, but only on a case by case basis. In granting those acceptances,
the Coast Guard used the same criteria that is contained in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which this notice
proposes to adopt. Proposed  154.315 continues to exceed the Gas Carrier Code in that the Gas Carrier Code allows
cargo pump and compressor rooms to be located below the weather deck. The Coast Guard takes the position that locating
the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms on the weather deck reduces the likelihood of permitting vapor accumulation
in those rooms. Of course, such arrangements would be considered under the provisions of  154.32 on equivalents.
This is consistent with the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code which require special approval for specified locations
of the cargo pump and cargo compressor rooms.

Section 154.315 also would be revised to require that personnel wearing protective clothing have complete access
to cargo pump and compressor rooms and are able to operate all valves necessary for cargo handling.

10. Section 154.320 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by specifying allowable openings for cargo
control stations not having access to accommodation, service, or control spaces. 

11. Section 154.330 would be revised to align it with the Gas Carrier Code by allowing less stringent requirements
for openings to accommodation, service, or control spaces on vessels dedicated to cargoes which are neither toxic
nor flammable.

12. Section 154.340 would be revised to clarify what is considered to be an acceptable access to gas-dangerous spaces,
such as duct keels and ballast compartments, and also to clarify that entry into fuel oil tanks must not be necessary
in order to perform inspections of the inner hull in the cargo area. These revisions correspond to amendments made
to the Gas Carrier Code.

13. Section 154.345 would be revised to make it clear when airlocks are required. The proposal also would prohibit
essential electrical equipment which is non-explosion proof from being in a space protected by an airlock. This is
necessary because non-explosion proof electrical equipment in such a space must be automatically deenergized upon
pressure loss in the space.

14. Section 154.350 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to waive the requirement for liquid leak detection
for certain spaces in internal insulation cargo containment systems, provided that those spaces are completely
filled with approved insulation.
15. Section 154.407 would be revised to designate the liquid height as ``Z

B

'' and to clarify that the definition of Z

B

 does not include small tank domes which are not considered part of the accepted total volume of the cargo tank. This
amendment is consistent with the Gas Carrier Code.
16. As discussed earlier,   154.454 through 154.458 would be added to address the use of internal insulation
tanks, as allowed by the amended Gas Carrier Code. The design of each of these tanks would be required to be approved
by the Coast Guard.
17. As stated earlier, table 3 in  154.459 would be revised to include requirements for internal insulation
tanks.
18. Under  154.468, information on certain properties of the insulation material used in internal insulation
tanks would be required to be submitted to the Coast Guard for approval. These properties were added to the list of insulation
properties required to be tested for internal insulation tanks under the Gas Carrier Code.
19. Section 154.519 would be revised to clarify that any cargo piping component capable of being isolated in the liquid
full condition must be fitted with a relief valve.
20. Section 154.522 would be revised in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code to allow relaxations approved
by the Commandant (G-MTH) of the minimum design temperature of open ended piping inside cargo tanks.
21. The table in  154.610 would be revised to raise the required test temperature for material in the thickness
range of 30 to 40mm from ^40 
 C to ^20 
 C, in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
22. Section 154.630 would be revised to clarify that the minimum yield strength used in the specified calculations
must be the yield strength of the aluminum alloy in the annealed condition. This section currently makes reference
only to the minimum tensile strength.
23. Section 154.901 would be revised to clearly state that the cargo tank atmosphere is never permitted to be in the
flammable range. It is necessary to prevent a flammable atmosphere from developing on a liquefied gas vessel because
there are no requirements prohibiting sources of ignition from being present. These vessels are designed and operated
based on the assumption that a flammable atmosphere will never be present.
24. Section 154.1110 would be revised to include storerooms containing high fire risk items in the area to be protected
by the water spray system and to clarify that each area listed is required to be covered by at least two jets of water.
These amendments are in line with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
25. Section 154.1115 would be revised to include guidance for determining the required capacity of the water spray
systems. This revision is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
26. Section 154.1320 would be revised to indicate that the pressure referred to is the design vapor pressure and not
the MARVS. This was also clarified in the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
27. New  154.1327 would provide a formula for determining the maximum acceptable shutdown time once the emergency
shutdown valve is activated. This maximum would represent the time until the tank becomes liquid full. This is consistent
with amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
28. Section 154.1343 would be added to require the installation of detectors, as required in the amended Gas Carrier
Code, for determining when a leak has occurred in the primary barrier. The detectors need only indicate that there
is a leak. They need not be able to pinpoint that leak.
29. Existing  154.1400 would be revised and   154.1401 and 154.1402 added to clearly indicate the
required safety equipment for all vessels and the additional equipment required for vessels carrying flammable
and toxic cargoes. These revisions correspond to amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
30. Section 154.1405 would be revised, as was the Gas Carrier Code, to clearly indicate that respiratory and eye protection
equipment intended for use as emergency escape equipment be so marked and never be used for fire fighting or cargo handling.
This section also would prohibit the use of filter-type respiratory equipment.
31. Section 154.1705 would be updated to include requirements for cargoes added to bring these regulations in line
with the Gas Carrier Code.

32. Section 154.1718 would be added to require that cargo spaces with submerged electric cargo pumps be inerted when
any of the sever high vapor pressure cargoes are carried. This is required by the amended Gas Carrier Code.
33. Section 154.1720 would be updated to include the new cargoes for which indirect refrigeration is required. This
is based on amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
34. Sections 154.1721 through 154.1724 would be added to include requirements for separate piping systems for toxic
products, flame screens on vent outlets, cargo tank quantity limitations, and vapor return connections. These requirements
are based on the amended Gas Carrier Code.
35. Section 154.1745 would be revised to include all of the requirements from 46 CFR part 40 for vinyl chloride transfer
operations. Existing  154.1745 references part 40, but there is no reason to have part 40's requirements contained
in a separate part. As part 50 addresses only vinyl chloride, this proposal would remove all of part 40 and transfer
its requirements to part 154.
36. Section 154.1760 would be revised to address the problem of stress corrosion cracking as it is addressed in the
Gas Carrier Code.
37. Section 154.1765 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of diethyl ether and vinyl ethyl
ether in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
38. New   154.1770 and 154.1775 would be added to set forth the requirements for the carriage of propylene
oxide and mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide which contain no more than 30% ethylene oxide by weight. These
requirements are consistent with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
39. Section 154.1818 would be revised to add new products to the list of products which may be carried if the shipper
certifies that they are inhibited. This revision is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
40. Section 154.1831 would be revised to list the qualifications of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations.
Section 155.710 of 33 CFR, as referenced in proposed paragraph (a), was amended by a separate Coast Guard rulemaking
(CGD 86-034; ``Hazardous Materials Pollution Prevention'') applying  155.710 to hazardous materials
transfers as well as to oil transfers.
41. Section 154.1832 would be added to clarify the necessary separation of cargo containment systems for incompatible
cargoes. This section is being proposed to ensure that incompatible cargoes are not allowed to come in contact with
each other on the vessel.
42. Section 154.1834 would be revised to clarify the responsibilities of the person in charge of cargo transfer operations
to ensure that the proper piping is used and to ensure that cargo vapors are properly handled.
43. Section 154.1850 would be revised to focus attention on the special problems caused by the gas absorbing qualities
of internal insulation materials. This is in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code.
44. Section 154.1870 would be revised to update the list of cargoes which are prohibited from being transferred via
bow or stern loading piping. This revision is based on the amendments to the Gas Carrier Code.
45. Section 154.7 and the table 4 following existing  154.1872 would be revised to include the minimum requirements
for the new cargoes added in accordance with the amended Gas Carrier Code and to update existing requirements and references.

Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget. It is not significant under the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulatory policies
and procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be
so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraphs 10e of the DOT regulatory policies and procedures is
unnecessary.

These proposed regulations would apply only to ``new gas vessels'', as the term is defined in  154.7. No currently
operating ``new gas vessels'' would be affected. There are presently no U.S. flag ``new gas vessels'', and currently
operating foreign ``new gas vessels'' already meet the similar requirements of the Gas Carrier Code.

The impact of this proposal on U.S. flag vessels constructed in the future is also anticipated to be minimal, because
the major part of this proposal allows for the carriage of cargoes previously required to be carried on chemical tankers
and for the addition of an alternative, less expensive, cargo containment system.

As stated above, the impact on foreign flag vessels built in the future will continue to be minimal because these vessels
will already comply with the requirements of the Gas Carrier Code.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 501 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

These proposals would apply only to liquefied gas vessels, all of which are large in size and owned by large corporations.

Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization
qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization,
please submit a comment (see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect it.



Collection of Information



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection-of-information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar
requirements.

This proposal contains collection-of-information requirements in the following section:  154.15. The following
particulars apply:






DOT No: 

2115.



OMB Control No: 

2115-0113.



Administration: 

U.S. Coast Guard.



Title: 

Safety Standards for Self-Propelled Vessels Carrying Bulk Liquefied Gases.




Need for Information: 

To prevent the uncontrolled release of cargo by liquefied gas carriers.




Proposed Use of Information: 

To verify compliance with safety regulations.




Frequency of Response: 

1 per respondent per year.




Burden Estimate: 

10 hours per year.




Respondents: 

Designers of cargo containment systems; eight worldwide




Form(s): 

No specific forms. Information supplied from existing plans and drawings used for designing a cargo containment
system.
