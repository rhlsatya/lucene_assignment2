Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant
to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award grants to: Alaska Department of Community
and Regional Affairs, Energy Division; Idaho Department of Water Resources, Energy Division; Montana Department
of Natural Resources and Conservation, Energy Division; Oregon Department of Energy; and Washington State Energy
Office. The awards represent a continuation of DOE funded research, development, and demonstration of bioenergy-related
technologies. Public Law 97-88 provides the statutory authority for the proposed award.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Through the agencies identified above, the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington have been engaged
in encouraging the development of bioenergy technologies for at least the last eleven years and have made successful
advances to:


(1) Produce cost-shared projects,
(2) establish regional bioenergy committees,
(3) Interact with trade and professional associations,
(4) Provide technical assistance to developers and utilities,
(5) Produce targeted information, and 
(6) Implement regulatory incentives or reduce regulatory and environmental barriers which promote the development
of bioenergy technologies. Research, development, and demonstration activities occurring under these grant agreement
will provide needed data and information to DOE and the bioenergy industry. This helps remove barriers to the utilization
of bioenergy technologies.
Therefore, these financial assistance applications are being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary
to continue activities presently being supported by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of
no other entities within respective state boundaries which are conducting these activities in the near or distant
future. The project period for the grant agreements is expected to begin in July 1994 for a five year period. DOE plans
to provide funding in the amount of $475,000 for each state for this project period (State in-kind match equals $125,000
and U.S. DOE funds equal $350,000).

 Notice of proposed changes to form. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Under its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and reporting burden for respondents (as required by the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
conducts a consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies an opportunity to comment
on its continuing and newly proposed survey forms. This program helps to assure that: (a) Data can be reported by respondents
in the requested format; (b) burden of reporting is minimized; (c) survey forms are clearly understood; and (d) the
impact of collection requirements on respondents can be accurately assessed. Currently, EIA is soliciting comments
concerning proposed changes to Form EIA-858, ``Uranium Industry Annual Survey,'' for the collection of 1994
data.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background

III. Request for Comments 


I. Background 


In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-275)
and the Department of Energy (DOE) Organization Act (Public Law 95-91), the Energy Information Administration
is conducting a comprehensive energy data and information program to collect, evaluate, assemble, and analyze periodic
data and information on the domestic uranium industry and economic and statistical information related to the adequacy
of domestic uranium resources and production capability to meet the Nation's near- and longer-term future needs.
The information collected is used by the Energy Information Administration to fulfill its monitoring and data dissemination
functions as mandated by the Congress. 
Data collected on these forms provide a comprehensive statistical characterization of the domestic uranium industry
in these areas: (a) Uranium exploration, mining, reserves, uranium concentrate production, and employment related
to those activities, and (b) uranium marketing activities, inventory status, imports and exports, enrichment feed
deliveries, purchases of enrichment services, and use of unirradiated uranium in new fuel assemblies. Published
data from these surveys are used by the Congress, Federal and State agencies, the uranium and electric-utility industries,
and the general public. National and State level data are published in the EIA reports ``World Nuclear Capacity and
Fuel Cycle Requirements,'' ``Uranium Purchases Report,'' ``Uranium Industry Annual,'' and the ``Annual Energy
Review.'' 


II. Current Actions 


Summary of Changes 


In the December 7, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice 
(58 FR 64399), the EIA proposed that 1994 data on uranium contracts (Item 1, Schedule B, annual Form EIA-858)
would be collected on a new quarterly survey form, Schedule M. Under this proposal also, the collection of 1994 data
under Schedule A and under Items 2-7 of Schedule B, Form EIA-858, would have been done annually. 
After review of comments received in response to the 

Federal Register 

notice, the EIA has decided not to implement the proposed new Schedule M for 1994. Instead, the technical suggestions
for improving the Form EIA-858 survey provided in the comments will be used, where applicable, to revise the
annual Schedule B as described below. 
For the EIA-858 survey for 1994, the EIA also has dropped the proposed new criteria that would have expanded the
number of data elements that would be releasable. The ``Provisions for Confidentiality'' declaration on the 1994
Form EIA-858 will remain the same as it was on the 1993 Form EIA-858. 
In the December 7, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice, the EIA also proposed to use a one-page survey, Form EIA-851, to collect quarterly data on uranium concentrate
production for 1994. The EIA has decided not to pursue at this time implementation of a formal survey form for the EIA-851
collection. Instead, the current mode of monthly reporting of uranium concentrate production data through collection
of internal company production reports and phone surveys will be continued. The production data collected under
the EIA-851 survey will continue to be treated as confidential. 


Detailed Description of Changes 




Form EIA-858: 

On the 1994 Form EIA-858, Schedule B data items have been reordered (compared with the 1993 Form EIA-858)
as described in the following table: 




</SUPPLEM>

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-2-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 




On the 1993 Form EIA-858 (left-hand column above), Items 1 and 6 (now Item 4) will be modified as described below.
Items 2, 3, 4 (now Item 5), and Item 5 (now Item 6) of Schedule B will continue to be collected without modifications.
Item 7, ``Enrichment Services Purchased by Utilities,'' on the 1993 Schedule B will be incorporated under Item 1.J,
``Utility Purchases of Enrichment Services,'' on the 1994 Schedule B. 


For Item 1 (Contract) 
Item 1 will be modified as explained under ``a'' through ``h'' below: 
a. A check off box will be added to Item 1.B to identify contracts that have been renegotiated based on price-related
issues. 
b. Item 1.C will be a new item to collect information on the term-of-delivery arrangement specified in a contract:
i.e., Whether the respondent classifies the reported contract as having a ``spot,'' short-term,'' ``medium-term,''
or a ``long-term'' delivery period. 
c. Item 1.D, ``Transaction Type,'' will provide separate check off boxes to indicate whether uranium materials were
sent or received under an Exchange transaction. 
d. Item 1.E will display a listing of applicable country identification codes from which respondents can choose to
report the country or countries of origin and/or destination for deliveries of natural uranium and the country of
enrichment services for enriched uranium. An ``Other'' space will be provided for respondents to write in a country
name and its identification code not listed under item 1.E. 
e. Item 1.F will be designed to collect data on individual quantities of delivered uranium and the type of material
delivered, its price, delivery date (DD/MM), whether the material was imported or exported, and country of origin.
For deliveries of enriched uranium product (EUP), the quantity will be reported as kilograms of uranium (KgU). The
transaction tails assay, the product assay, and the feed assay also will be reported to allow the EIA to calculate the
natural uranium feed component quantity as equivalent U

3

O

8

 for each delivered quantity. For EUP, the country of enrichment will be reported instead of the country of uranium
origin. For deliveries of both natural uranium and EUP, forecast for firm and optional deliveries will be requested
for a five-year forward period. 
f. Reporting the contract pricing mechanism under Item 1.H will be simplified to: (a) Request respondents to report
whether a pricing arrangement under a market-price related contract specifies a ``floor price'' or a ``no floor price'';
(b) add a check off box to capture ``spot-market price'' pricing arrangements; and (c) allow pricing arrangements
other than for ``market-price related'' and ``contract price'' to be reported as ``Other'' and briefly described
in the space provided. 
g. Under Item 1.I, respondents will be requested to briefly describe the options that are allowed under the contract
for the seller and/or the buyer (purchaser). 
h. Utility purchases of enrichment services (formerly Item 7 of Schedule B) will be reported under Item 1.J in order
to collect the reporting of all utility contracting activities under Item 1. This new format will permit the respondent
to report individual quantities of separative work units (SWU) purchased by a utility by the date of delivery, seller's
name, and the country of enrichment origin.

Take notice that on May 20, 1994, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Rayburn Electric), tendered for filing
proposed changes to its FERC Electric Service Tariff, Rate Schedule WP-S. Rayburn Electric proposes to replace
its current Rate Schedule WP-S with a new Rate Schedule WP-2 for the purpose of implementing a uniform,

of Texas (PUCT).

1

 The proposed rate changes are projected to increase revenues from jurisdictional sales and service by $413,672 (or
3.18 percent) from the existing FERC rate and decrease revenues by $7,223 (or 0.01 percent) from the existing PUCT
rate based upon the 12 month period ending December 31, 1994. 




The purpose of the proposed rate change is to permit Rayburn Electric to charge a common, blended rate for service to
all of its distribution members, thereby avoiding a disparity of rates and spreading savings resulting from a transaction
with the Southwestern Electric Power Company among all of its members. 

Copies of the filing were served upon Rayburn Electric's customers and the PUCT.

Decision and Order of The Department of Energy 


Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


Name of Petitioner: N. C. Ginther Company 
Date of Filing: July 20, 1993 
Case Number: LEF-0060

 

Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)
may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. 10 CFR
205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price
regulations. 
In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by the ERA
on July 20, 1993, for funds obtained due to alleged pricing violations in the sale of propane, butane, and natural gasoline
(natural gas liquids products). The funds at issue in that Petition were obtained through settlement of DOE enforcement
proceedings involving N. C. Ginther Company (Ginther), pursuant to 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The present Decision
will set forth final procedures for the distribution of these funds to qualified purchasers of Ginther's natural
gas liquids (NGL) products. 



I. Background 


During the period covered by the Consent Order (September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977), Ginther was a ``gas plant
operator'' (as defined in 10 CFR 212.162) and its sales were subject to DOE price regulations. Accordingly, Ginther
was subject to the DOE Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations. An ERA audit of Ginther's records revealed possible
violations of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations, 10 CFR part 212 subparts E and K, in specified transactions
during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977 (the consent order period).

1

 Consequently, the ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation (NOPV) to Ginther on December 31, 1980, alleging pricing
violations in the sale of propane, butane, and natural gasoline during the audit period. On March 25, 1983, Ginther
and the DOE entered into a Consent Order. The Consent Order refers to the ERA's allegations of regulatory violations.
It also includes Ginther's denials that any such violations occurred. 




As a result of the Consent Order, there is a total of $144,864.85, plus accrued interest, available for restitution.
This Decision concerns the distribution of all funds in the Ginther escrow account. 


II. The Proposed Decision and Order 


On April 14, 1994, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDO) establishing tentative procedures to distribute
the alleged violation amount obtained from Ginther. 59 FR 19005 (April 21, 1994). The OHA tentatively outlined procedures
under which purchasers of Ginther's NGL products could apply for refunds. In order to permit applicants to make refund
claims without incurring disproportionate costs as well as to allow the OHA to equitably and efficiently consider
those claims, we set forth a number of presumptions pertaining to refund procedures. 
First, we presumed that the alleged refined product overcharges were spread evenly over all of Ginther's sales of
NGL products during the Consent Order period. We therefore proposed that an applicant's potential refund generally
should be computed by multiplying the per-gallon refund amount by the number of gallons of Ginther's NGL products
that the claimant purchased during the Consent Order period. The resulting figure is referred to as the claimant's
``volumetric share'' of the Ginther Consent Order funds. Because an applicant may have been overcharged by more than
the volumetric amount, we proposed that an applicant could rebut the volumetric refund presumption by showing that
it sustained a greater amount of the overcharge. 
Because it is potentially difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to demonstrate that one was forced to absorb
any overcharges from Ginther, we proposed to adopt a number of presumptions concerning injury. We proposed that resellers
and retailers claiming refunds of $5,000 or less, end-users, agricultural cooperatives, and certain types of regulated
firms would be presumed injured by Ginther's alleged overcharges. We proposed that refiners, resellers, and retailers
seeking refunds greater than $5,000 could receive a maximum of $20,000 based upon 40 percent of their volumetric share
without having to prove injury. We also proposed to presume that claimants who made only spot purchases from Ginther
were not injured and must rebut that presumption to receive a refund. We stated that applicants not covered by one of
the injury presumptions would be required to demonstrate that they were forced to absorb any overcharge by Ginther
in order to receive their full volumetric shares of the Ginther Consent Order funds. 
Finally, we proposed that any money remaining after all Ginther refund claims are analyzed should be disbursed as
indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986
(PODRA), 15 U.S.C.   4501-4507 (1988). 
The PDO provided a period of 30 days from the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 in which comments could be filed regarding the tentative refund process. More than 30 days have elapsed and the OHA
has received no comments concerning the proposed procedures for the distribution of the Ginther settlement funds.
Consequently, the procedures will be adopted as proposed.

III. Refund Procedures 


A. Eligibility for Refund 


As indicated above, the Consent Order resolved all civil and administrative claims between DOE and Ginther. Accordingly,
to the extent that is possible, the Ginther Consent Order amount of $144,864.85, plus accrued interest, will be distributed
to purchasers of covered Ginther NGL products who can show that they were injured by Ginther's pricing practices during
the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977. 


B. Calculation of Refund Amount 


We are adopting a volumetric method to apportion the Ginther escrow account. Under this volumetric refund approach,
a claimant's allocable share of the refined products pool is equal to the number of gallons of covered products purchased
during the Consent Order period times a per gallon refund amount. We will derive the volumetric figure (per gallon
refund amount) by dividing the $144,864.85 received from Ginther by the total volume of NGL products sold by the firm
during the regulatory period, 25,312,920 gallons. This yields a volumetric refund amount of $.0057 per gallon, exclusive
of interest. This method is based upon the presumption that the alleged overcharges were spread equally over all gallons
of NGL products sold by Ginther during the regulatory period. 

E.g.

, 

American Pac. Int'l, Inc.

, 14 DOE   85,158, at 88,293 (1986).

2

 




Under the volumetric approach, an eligible claimant will receive a refund equal to the number of gallons of covered
products that it purchased from Ginther during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977, multiplied by
the per gallon volumetric amount for this proceeding. Accordingly, each claimant will be required to establish,
by documentation or reasonable estimation, the volume of products that it purchased during this period. In addition,
each successful claimant will receive a pro rata portion of the interest that has accrued on the Ginther funds since
the date of remittance. As in previous cases, we will establish a minimum amount of $15 for refund claims. 

E.g.

, 

Uban Oil Co.

, 9 DOE   82,541, at 85,225 (1982). Accordingly, an applicant must have purchased at least 2,544 gallons of NGL
products from Ginther in order for its claim to be considered. 


C. Showing of Injury 


Each claimant will be required to document its purchases of covered products from Ginther during the Consent Order
period. In addition, in order to receive a refund, an applicant generally must demonstrate through the submission
of detailed evidence that it did not pass on the alleged overcharges to its customers. See, 

e.g.

, 

Office of Enforcement

, 8 DOE   82,597, at 85,396-97 (1981) (

Vickers

).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940606-2-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, as we have done in many prior refund cases, we will adopt a number of presumptions regarding injury for claimants
in each category listed below. These presumptions are intended to ease what would be a time-consuming and potentially
expensive process if an applicant were forced to demonstrate that they absorbed the alleged overcharges. 


1. End-Users 


In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we are adopting the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumer
of Ginther NGL products whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry was injured by the alleged overcharges
settled by the consent order. See, 

e.g.

, 

Texas Oil and Gas Corp.

, 12 DOE   85,069, at 88,209 (1984) (

TOGCO

). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subject to price controls
during the consent order period and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference
to cost increases. Consequently, analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods and
services produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding. Id. Therefore, end-users
of Ginther NGL products need only document their purchase volumes from Ginther during the consent order period to
make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the alleged overcharges. 


2. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives 


In order to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices for goods and services are regulated by a governmental
agency, 

i.e.

, a public utility, or an agricultural cooperative which is required by its charter to pass through cost savings to
its member purchasers, need only submit documentation of purchases used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative,
sold to its members. However, a regulated firm or a cooperative will also be required to certify that it will pass any
refund received through to its customers or member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of how it plans to
accomplish the restitution, and certify that it will notify the appropriate regulatory body or membership group
of the receipt of the refund. See 

Marathon

, 14 DOE at 88,514-15. This requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respect to a regulated firm,
any overcharge would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received should
be passed through to its customers. With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreement which controls
its business operations would ensure that the alleged overcharges, and similarly refunds, would be passed through
to its member-customers. Accordingly, these firms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury.

3

 




3. Refiners, Resellers, and Retailers 


a. 

Small claims presumption.

 We will adopt a ``small claims'' presumption that resellers requesting relatively small refunds were injured by
the alleged overcharges. Under the small claims presumption, a refiner, reseller, or retailer seeking a refund of
$5,000 or less, exclusive of interest, will not be required to submit evidence of injury beyond documentation of the
volume of Ginther products it purchased during the consent order period. See 

TOGCO

, 12 DOE at 88,210. This presumption is based on the fact that there may be considerable expense involved in gathering
the types of data necessary to support a detailed claim of injury; for small claims the expense might even exceed the
potential refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified refund procedures for small claims could deprive injured
parties of their opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption is desirable because
it allows the OHA to process the large number of routine refund claims in an efficient manner.

4

 




b. 

Mid-Level Claim Presumption.

 In addition, a refiner, reseller, or retailer claimant whose allocable share of the refund pool exceeds $5,000, excluding
interest, may elect to receive as its refund either $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share, up to $20,000,

5

 whichever is larger.

6

 The use of this presumption reflects our conviction that these larger, mid-level claimants were likely to have experienced
some injury as a result of the alleged overcharges. See 

Marathon

, 14 DOE at 88,515. We are adopting a 40 percent presumptive level of injury for all mid-level claimants in this proceeding.
Consequently, an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentation of its purchase volumes of
Ginther NGL products during the consent order period in order to be eligible to receive a refund of 40 percent of its
total allocable share, up to $20,000, or $5,000, whichever is greater.

7

 






c. 

Spot purchasers.

 We are adopting a rebuttable presumption that a reseller that made only spot purchases from Ginther did not suffer
injury as a result of those purchases. As we have previously stated, spot purchasers generally had considerable discretion
as to the timing and market in which they made their purchases and therefore would not have made spot market purchases
from a firm at increased prices unless they were able to pass through the full amount of the firm's selling price to their
own customers. See, 

e.g.

, 

Vickers

, 8 DOE at 85,396-97. Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specific and detailed evidence to rebut
the spot purchaser presumption and to establish the extent to which it was injured as a result of its spot purchases
from Ginther.

D. Allocation Claims 




We may also receive claims based upon Ginther's alleged failure to furnish products that it was obliged to supply under
the DOE allocation regulations that became effective in January 1974. See 10 CFR part 211. Any such applications will
be evaluated with reference to the standards set forth in subpart V implementation cases such as 

Office of Special Counsel, 

10 DOE  85,048, at 88,220 (1982), and refund application cases such as 

Mobil Oil Corp./Reynolds Indus., Inc., 

17 DOE  85,608 (1988); 

Marathon Petroleum Co./Research Fuels, Inc., 

19 DOE  85,575 (1989) (

Marathon/RFI

), 

aff'd sub nom. Research Fuels, Inc. 

v. 

DOE, 

No. CA3-89-2983G (N.D. Tex. 1990), 

aff'd,

 977 F.2d 601 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1992). These standards generally require an allocation claimant to demonstrate
the existence of a supplier/purchaser relationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consent
order firm failed to furnish NGL products that it was obliged to supply to the claimant under 10 CFR part 211. In addition,
the claimant should provide evidence that it had contemporaneously notified the DOE or otherwise sought redress
from the alleged allocation violation. Finally, the claimant must establish that it was injured and document the
extent of the injury. 


In our evaluation of whether allocation claims meet these standards, we will consider various factors. For example,
we will seek to obtain as much information as possible about the agency's treatment of complaints made to it by the claimant.
We will also look at any affirmative defenses that Ginther may have had to the alleged allocation violation. See 

Marathon/RFI, 

19 DOE  85,575. In assessing an allocation claimant's injury, we will evaluate the effect of the alleged allocation
violation on its entire business operations with particular reference to the amount of product that it received from
suppliers other than Ginther. In determining the amount of an allocation refund, we will utilize any information
that may be available regarding the portion of the Ginther consent order amount that the agency attributed to allocation
violations in general and to the specific allocation violation alleged by the claimants. Finally, since the Ginther
consent order fund is less than Ginther's potential liability in the proceedings, we will pro rate those allocation
refunds that would otherwise be disproportionately large in relation to the consent order fund. 

Cf. Amtel/Whitco, 

19 DOE  85,319. 




E. Distribution of Funds Remaining After First Stage 




In the event that money remains after all refund claims from the Ginther funds have been analyzed, the remaining funds
in that account will be disbursed as indirect restitution in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501-07. PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy
determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties
in subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments for use in energy conservation programs.
The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and any funds in the Ginther consent order escrow account
that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured customers will be distributed in
accordance with the provisions of PODRA. 




IV. General Refund Application Requirements 




Pursuant to 10 CFR 205.283, we will now accept Applications for Refund from individuals and firms that purchased NGL
products sold by Ginther during the period September 1, 1973, through March 31, 1977. There is no specific application
form that must be used. However, the following information should be included in all Applications for Refund: 


(1) Identifying information including the claimant's name, current business address, business address during
the refund period, taxpayer identification number, a statement indicating whether the claimant is a corporation,
partnership, sole proprietorship, or other business entity, the name, title, and telephone number of a person to
contact for any additional information, and the name and address of the person who should receive any refund check.

9

 If the applicant operated under more than one name or under a different name during the price control period, the applicant
should specify these names. 




(2) If the applicant's firm is owned by another company, or owns other companies, a list of those companies' names,
addresses, and descriptions of their relationship to the applicant's firm. 


(3) A brief description of the claimant's business and the manner in which it used the petroleum products listed on
its application. 


(4) A monthly schedule of the applicant's purchases of NGL products that it purchased from Ginther during the Consent
Order period. The applicant must indicate the name of its supplier and the delivery location. The applicant should
indicate the source of its volume information. Monthly schedules should be based upon actual, contemporaneous business
records. If such records are not available, the applicant may submit estimates provided that those estimates are
reasonable and the estimation methodology is explained in detail.

<PARENT> FR940606-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(5) If the applicant was an indirect purchaser, it should submit the name, address, and telephone number of its immediate
supplier and indicate why it believes that the NGL products was originally sold by Ginther. 

(6) A statement whether the applicant or a related firm has filed, or authorized any individual to file on its behalf,
any other Application for Refund in the Ginther proceeding, and if so, the circumstances surrounding that filing
or authorization. 

(7) A statement whether the applicant was in any way affiliated with Ginther. If so, the applicant should explain the
nature of the affiliation. 

(8) If the applicant is a reseller, retailer, or refiner whose volumetric share exceeds $5,000, it must indicate whether
it elects to receive its maximum refund under the presumptions of injury. If it does not elect a presumption of injury,
it must submit a detailed showing that it was injured by Ginther's pricing practices. 

(9) If the applicant is a regulated utility or a cooperative, certifications that it will pass on the entirety of any
refund received to its customers, will notify its state utility commission, other regulatory agency, or membership
body of the receipt of any refund, and a brief description as to how the refund will be passed along. 

(10) A statement whether there has been any change in the ownership of the entity that purchased the covered Ginther
products at any time during or after the refund period. If so, the name and address of the current (or former) owner should
be provided. 

(11) The statement listed below signed by the individual applicant or a responsible official of the company filing
the refund application: 





I swear (or affirm) that this is the only refund Application filed on behalf of this applicant in the N.C. Ginther Company
special refund proceeding and that the information contained in this Application and its attachments is true and
correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing false information
to the federal government may be subject to a fine, a jail sentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. I understand
that the information contained in this Application is subject to public disclosure. I have enclosed a duplicate of
this entire Application which will be placed in the OHA Public Reference Room. 





We also invite each applicant to submit copies of no more than five contemporaneous invoices or other proofs of purchase
showing that it purchased NGL products from Ginther. While this information is not required of refund applicants,
it may well expedite the processing of the refund application. 

All applications should be either typed or printed and clearly labeled ``N.C. Ginther Company Application for Refund.''
Each applicant must submit an original and one copy of the application. If the applicant believes that any of the information
in its application is confidential and does not wish for this information to be publicly disclosed, it must submit
an original application, clearly designated ``confidential,'' containing the confidential information, and
two copies of the application with the confidential information deleted. All refund applications should be sent
to: N.C. Ginther Company Refund Proceeding, Case No. LEF-0060, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department
of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585. 



The filing deadline is November 30, 1994. 

It Is Therefore Ordered That: 

(1) Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department of Energy by N.C. Ginther Company pursuant to
the Consent Order finalized on March 25, 1983, may now be filed. 

(2) All Applications submitted pursuant to Paragraph (1) above must be filed in duplicate and postmarked no later
than November 30, 1994.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement
of $870,000, plus accrued interest, in alleged crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent
Order entered into with Dane Energy Company, Case No. LEF-0122. The OHA has tentatively determined that the
funds obtained through this Consent Order, plus accrued interest, will be distributed in accordance with the DOE's
Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
to eligible claimants $870,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order entered
into with Dane Energy Company on December 16, 1993. The funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations
of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period December 1978 through
December 1980. 



The OHA has proposed to distribute the Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge
monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products.
Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during
the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products
which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. 

Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in room 1E-234, 1000 Independence

Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


Name of Firm: Dane Energy Company 
Date of Filing: April 8, 1994 
Case Number: LEF-0122






Under the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA)
may request that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement special refund procedures. 10 CFR
205.281. These procedures are used to refund monies to those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price
regulations. 



In this Decision and Order, we consider a Petition for Implementation of Special Refund Procedures filed by the ERA
on April 8, 1994, for crude oil overcharge funds. The funds at issue in this petition were obtained from Dane Energy
Company (Dane). This Office issued a Remedial Order to Dane finding violations of the crude oil pricing regulations
during the period December 1978 through December 1980. 

Dane Energy Co.,

 22 DOE  83,007 (1992). That Order required Dane to remit $8,361,227.88 to the DOE. Believing that it serves the
public interest for DOE to compromise its claims against Dane on an ability-to-pay basis where, as here, the financial
status of the covered party can be satisfactorily determined, DOE agreed to enter into a Consent Order, whereby Dane
agreed to remit $870,000. The DOE received $870,000 on April 8, 1993. This Decision and Order establishes the OHA's
procedures to distribute those funds. 



The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in
10 CFR part 205, subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the
persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount
of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to
fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see 

Office of Enforcement,

 9 DOE  82,508 (1981), and 

Office of Enforcement,

 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). We have considered the ERA's request to implement subpart V procedures with respect to
the monies received from Dane and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. 




I. Background 





On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Statement of Modified Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August
4, 1986) (the SMRP). The SMRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,

 M.D.L. No. 378 (D. Kan. 1986), 

reprinted in

 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,501 (the Stripper Well Agreement), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will
be divided among the states, the federal government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Eighty
percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states
and federal government for indirect restitution. 



Shortly after the issuance of the SMRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the Modified Policy
in all subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the Modified Statement
of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited
comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refund
proceedings. The OHA then issued a Notice analyzing the numerous comments and setting forth generalized procedures
to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil monies under the subpart V regulations. 52 FR 11737
(April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). 



The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April 10 Notice, 

e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc.,

 18 DOE  85,435 (1988) (

New York Petroleum

); 

Shell Oil Co.,

 17 DOE  85,204 (1988); 

Ernest A. Allerkamp,

 17 DOE  85,079 (1988) (

Allerkamp

), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various States filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that
the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly
calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,

 671 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Kan. 1987), 

aff'd,

 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). On August 17, 1987, Judge Theis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States'
Motion in its entirety. The court concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the] OHA from permitting
claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.''


Id.

 at 1323. The court also ruled that, as specified in the April 10 Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion
of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. 

Id.

 at 1323-24.

II. The Proposed Refund Procedures 



A. Refund Claims 





We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 10 Notice to the crude oil subpart V proceeding that is
the subject of the present determination. As noted above, $870,000 of an alleged crude oil violation is covered by
this proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount,
or $174,000, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds
to injured parties. 



The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the
process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined
products. 

E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,

 14 DOE   85,475 (1986) (

Mountain Fuel

). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and
prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, a covered product is any product that
was either covered by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C.   751-760, or if
the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery. See 

Great Salt Lake Minerals & Chem. Corp.,

 23 DOE   88,118, at 88,305 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,
whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are
presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not
submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price
controls. 

E.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,

 15 DOE   85,495, at 88,893-96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence
which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. 

E.g., Berry Holding Co.,

 16 DOE   85,405, at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious
doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury. 

E.g., New York Petroleum,

 18 DOE at 88,701-03. 



Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury and may not rely on the presumptions of injury
utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometric evidence of the
type employed in the 

Report by the Office of Hearings and Appeals to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, In Re: The
Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, reprinted in 

6 Fed. Energy Guidelines   90,507 (1986). Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one
of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds under
subpart V. 

Mid-America Dairyman, Inc. 

v.

 Herrington,

 878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989); accord 

Boise Cascade Corp.,

 18 DOE   85,970 (1989). 



Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined products will be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund
amount derived by dividing the alleged crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination ($870,000) by
the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000
gallons). 

Mountain Fuel,

 14 DOE at 88,868 n.4. 



As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will be required to submit only one application for
crude oil overcharge funds. 

E.g., Allerkamp,

 17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund application in the crude oil refund proceedings
need not file another application. That previously filed application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil proceedings
as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application
for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 F.R. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund
claims filed within this deadline at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants
that filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we
will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds. 

E.g., Seneca Oil Co.,

 21 DOE   85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 




B. Payments to the States and Federal Government 





Under the terms of the SMRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts
subject to this Decision, or $696,000, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for
indirect restitution. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the
Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements
as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement. 





It Is Therefore Ordered That:

 
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Dane Energy Company pursuant to the Consent Order executed
on April 8, 1993 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy, Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 





Name of Firm: 

Telum, Inc. 


Date of Filing: 

October 7, 1993. 


Case Number: 

LEF-0114. 


May 31, 1994.


In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 CFR part 205, subpart V, the Economic
Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures
with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on October 7, 1993. The petition requests that OHA formulate and implement
procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to a consent order entered into by the DOE and Telum, Inc.
(Telum). 


I. Background 


Telum was a ``reseller-retailer'' of ``covered products'' as those terms were defined in 6 CFR 150.352 and 10 CFR 212.31.
Therefore, Telum was required to price middle distillate fuel in accordance with the price rule of the Mandatory Petroleum
Price Regulations set forth at 10 CFR part 212, subpart F, and antecedent regulations at 6 CFR part 150, subpart L. As
a result of an audit, the ERA alleged that Telum and entities under Telum's direction violated the price regulations
in sales of middle distillate fuel to Salt River Project (Salt River) during a five month period from December 1, 1973,
through April 30, 1974 (the audit period).
 The auditors determined that during this period Telum made sales of middle distillates to Salt River at prices in excess
of the maximum lawful selling price (MLSP) permitted by the regulations. Consequently, the ERA issued a Proposed
Remedial Order (PRO) to Telum on May 28, 1980, alleging pricing violations in the sale of middle distillate fuel to
Salt River. After revising its selection of the ``nearest comparable outlet'' with regard to the ``new market'' determination
under 10 CFR 212.111(b), the ERA issued an Amended PRO on September 15, 1986, alleging that Telum had overcharged Salt
River in its sales of middle distillate fuel in the amount of $357,587. On April 7, 1988, that Amended PRO was remanded
by OHA to the ERA, for a new determination regarding Telum's nearest comparable outlet and a recalculation of MLSPs
and any overcharges in sales to Salt River. Telum, Inc., 17 DOE  83,010 (1988). 






The ERA did not issue a second Amended PRO. Instead, on May 30, 1990, the DOE entered into a consent order (No. 820H00020Z)
with Telum to resolve all administrative and civil claims related to Telum's compliance with the Federal petroleum
price and allocation regulations in its resale transactions of petroleum products during the period December 1,
1973 through April 30, 1974. Specifically, Telum agreed to remit $60,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in
an interest-bearing escrow account. Telum has remitted $56,149.35 to the DOE, consisting of $51,626.18 toward payment
of the $60,000 principal amount due and $4,523.17 toward payment of interest due on principal. The DOE has authorized
a write-off of the remainder of the amount due for reasons of uncollectability. Telum is no longer in business, and
Earl K. Cook, the former president of Telum, has indicated that he is unable to pay the remainder of the amount due. As
of March 31, 1994, $9,028.85 in interest had accrued in the DOE escrow account on the amount paid by Telum. 


II. Jurisdiction 


The procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines by which the Office of Hearings and Appeals may
formulate and implement a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 CFR
part 205, subpart V. It is the DOE policy to use the subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion
of subpart V and the authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals to fashion procedures to distribute refunds obtained
as part of consent orders, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE  82,553 (1982); Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE  82,508
(1981); Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). After reviewing the record in the present case, we have
concluded that a subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the Telum consent order fund.
We therefore propose to grant the ERA's petition and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the fund.

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 


A. Refund Claimant 


Insofar as possible, the consent order fund should be distributed to customers of Telum who were injured by the alleged
overcharges. Salt River, the only Telum customer who made purchases during the consent order period that were covered
by the PRO and Amended PRO, is the only Telum customer we have identified as likely to have been injured by the alleged
overcharges. Although we recognize that the Telum consent order covers all sales of ``covered products'' by Telum
for the period December 1, 1973 through April 30, 1974, the ERA audit files, the PRO, and the Amended PRO are all based
only on sales by Telum to Salt River. The consent order, while lacking in specificity, was clearly arrived at in order
to settle this one outstanding enforcement issue. We are thus able to use the information contained in the audit files
for guidance as to the identity of Telum's injured customer and the extent of the alleged overcharges, as we have done
in some prior refund proceedings. See, e.g., Howard Oil Co., 15 DOE  85,072 (1986). Consequently, we propose
to establish a claims procedure in which Salt River may apply for a refund of the entire consent order fund. Limiting
the universe of applicants to Salt River allows us to fashion a refund plan that will correspond most closely to the
alleged overcharges settled by the consent order. See Consumers Oil Co., 13 DOE  85,226 (1985); Marion Corp.,
12 DOE  85,014 (1984). 

In prior refund proceedings, in order to receive a full refund, claimants whose prices for goods and services are regulated
by a governmental body, e.g., a public utility, have not been required to provide a detailed showing of injury. See,
e.g., Dorchester Gas Corp., 14 DOE  85,240 at 88,451 (1986). Instead, regulated firms have been required to
(i) certify that they will pass any refund received through to their customers, (ii) provide us with a full explanation
of how they plan to accomplish the restitution, and (iii) certify that they will notify the appropriate regulatory
body of the receipt of the refund. Id. This requirement is based on the presumption that, with respect to a regulated
firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed through to its customers. Similarly, any refunds received
should be passed through to its customers. 
We have been informed by Salt River that the nature of its business is that of a municipal public power utility whose
rates for electricity are set by a publicly-elected Board of Directors (i.e., a governmental body). See Memorandum
of April 29, 1994 Telephone Conversation between John Egan, Spokesperson for Salt River, and Andrew Beckwith, OHA
Staff Analyst. We have determined, therefore, that Salt River is a regulated firm as that category is defined above.
See City of Lubbock, 18 DOE  85,116 (1988). Accordingly, we propose that Salt River, as a regulated firm, need
not make a showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges. However, Salt River will be required to comply with
the stipulations outlined above that are incumbent upon regulated firms when submitting an Application for Refund.



B. Calculation of Refund Amount 


As stated above, the ERA audit files identify Salt River as the Telum customer injured by the alleged overcharges that
were the subject of the consent order. We propose to pay the entire amount of the consent order fund to Salt River as a
refund for the alleged overcharges. In addition, Salt River will receive all of the interest that has accrued on the
consent order fund. 


IV. Conclusion 


Salt River should not file a refund application in this proceeding until the issuance of a final Decision and Order.
Detailed procedures for filing an application will be provided in the final Decision and Order. Before disposing
of any of the funds received as a result of the Telum consent order, we intend to publicize the distribution process
and to provide an opportunity for any affected party to submit comments. All comments must be filed within 30 days of
the publication of this Proposed Decision in the 

Federal Register

. In addition to publishing copies of the proposed and final Decisions in the 

Federal Register

, copies of both will be provided to Salt River. 

It is therefore ordered that: 
The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Telum, Inc. pursuant to Consent Order No. 820H00020Z, finalized
on May 30, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Title: 

Statement Regarding the Importation of Radio Frequency Devices Capable of Causing Harmful Interference



Form Number: 

FCC Form 740



Action: 

Extension of currently approved collection



Respondents: 

Individuals or households, state or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit
(including small businesses)



Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement



Estimated Annual Burden: 

496,500 responses; .037 hours average burden per response; 18,371 hours total annual burden



Needs and Uses: 

FCC Form 740 declaration is submitted to the Commission and U.S. Customs Service upon importation of radio frequency
(RF) devices. 




The information collection describes devices being imported that may be harmful to authorized radio frequencies
so that the FCC, with the assistance of Customs, can carry out this responsibility. Examples of RF devices include:
Microwave ovens, virtually any product containing a computer microprocessor, computers and computer peripherals,
telephones with memory or other advanced features, video cameras and recorders, transmitters and transceivers,
most receivers including television receivers, electronic musical instruments, video games, and radio remote
control toys. Rule changes in 1990 reduced the number and types of devices for which the import declaration is required.
Those rule changes also has led to the use of electronic submission of the required information. Because of the effect
of the change to electronic filing, the number of paper forms submitted annually has dropped by an estimated sixty
percent. The information continues to be used by FCC to ensure that radio frequency devices imported into the United
States and its customs territory comply with applicable FCC Rules and Regulations. Information is necessary to FCC/FOB
Enforcement Division, FCC Laboratory and U.S. Customs. Purpose is to keep non-compliant devices from being distributed
to the general public thereby reducing the potential for harmful interference being caused to authorized communications.
When a violation is discovered, the FCC can issue a fine or request Customs to issue redelivery notice to the importer.
If the importer does not redeliver the RF device to Customs, the importer is subject to fines imposed by the U.S. Customs
Service.

Title: 

FCC Rate Regulation Impact Survey.



Action: 

New collection.



Respondents: 

Business or other for-profit.



Frequency of Response: 

Other: One-time survey.



Estimated Annual Burden: 

100 respondents, 25 responses each, 2500 total responses; 1 hour average burden per response; 2500 hours total annual
burden.



Needs and Uses: 

Section 623 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act of 1992 (``Cable-Act'') required the Commission to establish rules to govern rate regulation of cable services
offered by cable systems that are not subject to effective competition. On 2/22/94, the Commission adopted revised
cable rate regulations in a Second Order on reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order and Fifth Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking MM Docket No. 92-266, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation, wherein we revised rules to implement section 623, subscriber rate regulation.
The new rules became effective on May 15, 1994, and, pursuant to   76.932 and 76.964 of the rules, cable
systems must give subscribers 30 days notice of any proposed rate change or restructuring made by the cable system.
In connection with these orders, the Commission will conduct a survey on the impact of these new rate regulations.
The purpose of this survey is to determine the effect of our regulations on the rates for regulated cable services since
the 5/15/94 effective date. This survey will be addressed to the largest 100 multiple system operators. Surveying
the largest multiple system operators will permit a review of rate practices under our revised regulations of cable
operators providing a majority of cable service in the United States. The consequences of not conducting this survey
will impair our ability to assess whether our rate regulations have been effective. Respondents will be requested
to submit copies of documentation which verifies subscriber notification, via facsimile, and respond to both written
and telephone inquiries by FCC staff. Any responses may be made by telephone or in written format via facsimile, upon
request by Bureau staff.

<DOCTITLE>Citicorp, New York, New York; Request for an Exemption from Tying Provisions</DOCTITLE>


Citicorp, New York, New York (Citicorp), has requested, pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act
Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C.  1971 

et seq.

) (Section 106(b)), that the Board grant an exemption to permit any subsidiary of Citicorp to vary the consideration
charged for mortgage loans based upon the condition or requirement that the customer obtain a loan, discount, deposit,
or trust service from an affiliate.
Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition
or requirement that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product (loan, discount, deposit or trust service)
from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank from engaging in these same activities on condition that
the customer obtain any additional credit or services from any affiliate. The Board may, by regulation or order, grant
exceptions that are not contrary to the purposes of the section.
Citicorp contends that its request is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because it is not anticompetitive.
Citicorp argues that the market for mortgage loans is national in scope and highly competitive. In this regard, Citicorp
asserts that it does not have sufficient market power in any relevant market to restrain competition and that the highly
competitive mortgage lending market prevents any mortgage lender from having sufficient market power to restrain
competition in the market or force a consumer to purchase a product on uncompetitive terms. 
Further, Citicorp argues that its proposal is not anticompetitive because customers would not be required either
directly or indirectly to accept one product in order to obtain another product. In this regard, Citicorp states that
all products would be available separately at separate prices and the prices of products would be kept competitive
through normal market forces. Citicorp also claims that customers would be free to choose to purchase combined or
separate services from Citicorp affiliates or from competitors. Finally, Citicorp contends that the proposal would
promote competition and provide public benefits in the form of reduced costs and better service. 
Notice of Citicorp's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented
by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards
of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than July 5, 1994.

National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; Implementing Lead-Based Paint Abatement Training for Workers
and Supervisors 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a grant program to provide training for workers and supervisors engaged or expected to be engaged in lead-based paint
abatement work. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.
This announcement is related to the priority area of Occupational Safety and Health. (For ordering a copy of Healthy
People 2000, see the section 

Where To Obtain Additional Information

). 






Authority: 

This program is authorized under section 22(g) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 671(g)), as amended
by section 1033 of Pub. L. 102-550, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all
tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of
the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Only non-profit organizations (including colleges and universities, joint labor-management trust funds, States,
and non-profit government employee organizations) who have experience in the implementation and operation of health
and safety training for lead-based paint abatement workers and supervisors will be considered for funding. 

For the purposes of this notice, the term ``lead-based paint abatement activity'' means activities engaged in by
workers that include the removal, disposal, handling, and transportation of lead-based paint and materials containing
lead-based paint from public and private dwellings, public and commercial buildings, bridges and other structures
or superstructures where lead-based paint presents or may present an unreasonable risk to health and safety of the
environment. 

Grants made under this program shall be awarded only to those organizations that fund at least 30% of their lead-based
paint training programs from non-Federal sources excluding in-kind contributions. 

In-kind contributions are defined as the value of a non-cash contribution to meet a recipient's cost-sharing requirement.
An in-kind contribution may consist of charges for real property and equipment, or the value of goods and services,
directly benefiting the NIOSH-funded project. 

The above stipulations are mandated by section 22(g) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 671(g)),
as amended. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $500,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately four awards. It is expected that the average
award will be $125,000, ranging from $100,000 to $150,000. The awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for
a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to four years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change.


Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 



Purpose 



The purpose of these awards is to ensure that lead-based paint abatement workers and supervisors receive adequate
training and education concerning the health and safety issues of working with and abating lead-based paint. 



Program Requirements 



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for conducting
activities as follows: 

1. Develop and conduct a four-year training program for workers and supervisors involved or expected to be involved
in lead-based paint abatement activity. 

2. Identify and select regions and populations for training, based on a list of criteria determined by the applicant.


3. Designate specific levels of training, amount of training, and number of trainees to be trained each year. Course
materials utilized will be those which meet the most up-to-date Federal (EPA/HUD) requirements. 

4. Evaluate the effectiveness of such training.

<DOCTITLE>Potential Reallotment of Funds for FY 1993 Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</DOCTITLE>

AGENCY:

 Office of Community Services, Administration for Children and Families, (ACF), Department of Health and Human Services.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Preliminary determination concerning funds available for reallotment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hearby given that a preliminary determination has been made that FY 1993 Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP) funds are available for reallotment. Section 2607(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 

et. seq.

), as amended, requires that if the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines that, as of
September 1 of any fiscal year, an amount allotted to a grantee for any fiscal year will not be used by that grantee during
the fiscal year, the Secretary must notify the grantee and publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 that such funds may be reallotted. As the Secretary's designee, I have determined that a total of $22,591 of FY 1993
funds may be available for reallotment. I have based that determination on reports from the United Tribes of Kansas
and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. (Kansas), Seldovia Village Tribe (Alaska) and the Aroostock Band of Micmacs (Maine)
which were submitted to the Office of Community Services as required by 45 CFR 96.81.



The statute allows grantees who have funds unobligated at the end of a fiscal year to request that they be allowed to
carry over up to 10 percent of their allotments to the next fiscal year. Funds in excess of this amount must be returned
to HHS and are subject to reallotment to other grantees under section 2607(b)(1) of the LIHEAP statute. All of the amounts
described in this notice were reported as unobligated funds in excess of the amount that the three tribes named above
could carry over to FY 1994.

The United Tribes of Kansas and Southeast Nebraska, Inc. were notified by certified mail that $2,384 of its FY 1993
LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Seldovia Village Tribe was notified by certified mail that $5,117 of their FY 1993
LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. The Aroostock Band of Micmacs was notified by certified mail that $15,090 of its FY
1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. In accordance with section 2607(b)(3), the Chief Executive Officer of each of
these tribes has 30 days from the date of the letters to submit comments to me. That 30 day period will expire June 16,
1994. After considering any comments submitted, I will notify the Chief Executive Officer of my decision and will
publish my decision in the 

Federal Register

. 
If funds are reallotted, they will be allocated in accordance with section 2604 and will be treated as an amount appropriated
for FY 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 Inclusion of Outpatient Hospital Facilities</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 602 of Public Law 102-585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, in which the
manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed the amount determined under
a statutory formula. 



Section 340B(a)(4) lists the entities eligible to receive discount outpatient drug pricing (i.e., certain disproportionate
share hospitals (DSHs) and PHS grantees). The definition of a disproportionate share hospital found in section 340B(a)(4)(L)
provides criteria to determine which such hospitals are eligible to participate in the program. However, the definition
does not include criteria to determine which outpatient facilities (including off-site or satellite clinics) working
in conjunction with the eligible hospital would be considered part of the hospital for purposes of eligibility for
section 340B drug discounts. The Office of Drug Pricing, which administers this program with PHS, is proposing certain
procedures to determine which outpatient hospital facilities are included as part of an eligible disproportionate
share hospital.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 340B(a)(4) of the PHS Act lists the various groups of entities eligible to receive the section 340B discount
pricing. Section 340B(a)(4)(L)  
 describes a subset of ``hospitals'' as defined in section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act as eligible to
participate in the program. Because section 1886 addresses Medicare payment for hospital inpatient services only,
the scope of the term ``hospital'' has been limited to the hospital inpatient services. However, section 340B deals
exclusively with outpatient drugs. Although Congress clearly intended that this narrow definition be used to identify
Medicare disproportionate share hospitals which are eligible for section 340B drug discounts, we do not believe
it is reasonable to use this same definition to limit where the section 340B outpatient drug can be used. Some disproportionate
share hospitals offer outpatient services in off-site or satellite outpatient facilities. Further, the movement
of nonprofit hospitals in recent years has been to reorganize and offer a variety of services other than traditional
inpatient hospital services through separate divisions, lines of business, or entities. Therefore, for purposes
of section 340B drug discounts, a more inclusive interpretation of ``hospital'' is needed. 





The Office of Drug Pricing Program is proposing to recognize as part of an eligible DSH outpatient facilities (including
off-site and satellite clinics) which meet the following standard:




The outpatient facility is considered an integral part of the ``hospital'' and therefore eligible for section 340B
drug discounts if it is a reimbursable 
facility included on the hospital's Medicare cost report.




For example, if a hospital with one Medicare provider number meets the disproportionate share criteria and this hospital
has associated outpatient clinics whose costs are listed on the Medicare cost report, these clinics would also be
eligible for section 340B drug discounts. However, free-standing clinics of the hospital that submit their own cost
reports using a different Medicare number (not under the single hospital Medicare provider number) would not be eligible
for this benefit. 



This test, using the single Medicare provider number, is proposed for three reasons. First, Congress referred to
section 1886 of the Social Security Act, part of the Medicare statute, for the definition of a DSH in section 340B(a)(4)(L)
of the PHS Act. We believe, therefore, that it is reasonable to utilize existing Medicare rules to determine eligibility
for the drug discount program. The proposed Medicare cost report test was developed by Medicare officials and is used,
in part, to determine whether a facility is part of a hospital. If an outpatient facility does not share in the hospital
cost report, it is properly viewed as an independent, free-standing facility. 

Second, the relative administrative burden of the proposed test (i.e., obtaining sufficient documentation to verify
the inclusion of these off-site facilities) should be minimal. Hospitals seeking Medicare reimbursement are required
to submit annual cost reports including all hospital units (e.g., on site and off-site clinics); therefore, the information
necessary to determine facility eligibility is available and needs no further analysis by the Office of Drug Pricing.


Third, the test incorporates criteria (i.e., the Medicare cost report) that form an independent and objective basis
upon which to determine eligibility. Therefore, this test should provide fair and easy administration. 

If DSHs have difficulty accessing PHS pricing for eligible outpatient clinics, they should contact the Office of
Drug Pricing (not HCFA) for assistance. If manufacturers have questions concerning the eligibility of certain DSH
outpatient clinics, they should also contact the Office of Drug Pricing for a determination of eligibility.

ACTION: 

Notice of reopening and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission adopted the Annual Report Form M-2 (Form M-2) for class II motor carriers of property, as
set forth below. The purpose of this notice is to give interested parties an opportunity to comment on the new form.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

By decision in Ex Parte No. MC-206, Revision to Accounting and Reporting Requirements for Motor Carriers of
Property, 9 I.C.C.2d 1268 (1994), and published at 59 FR 5110 (2-3-94) (Final Rule), we adopted a new and
separate annual report form for class II motor carriers of property, designated as Annual Report Form M-2.




In our Final Rule, we retained class II annual reporting at a reduced level of detail as compared to the old Annual Report
Form M. Before adoption of the Final Rule, no opportunity for public comment on the content of the Form M-2 was
provided. For this reason, we are reopening this proceeding on our own motion to provide such an opportunity.


Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to,
call or pick up in person from: Office of the Secretary, Room 2215, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC
20423. Telephone: (202) 927-7428. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services
(202) 927-5721.]


We conclude that implementation of our action to seek comments will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Form M-2 was adopted previously. This notice only affords interested persons an opportunity
to offer comments.


The Form M-2 contained in this notice will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (5 CFR 1320). Interested persons may direct comments concerning the paperwork
burden and burden estimates of the Form M-2 to the OMB and ICC by addressing them to:




Office of Management & Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Desk Officer for ICC (Forms 3120-),
Washington, DC 20503.

Interstate Commerce Commission, ATTN: Information Resource Management Forms, Clearance Officer, Room 4136, Washington,
DC 20423.







We conclude that implementation of our action to seek comments will not have a significant impact upon the quality
of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.

Petitions for Modification



The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section
101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.



1. CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-60-C]



CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc., 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1101-8 (water sprinkler system; arrangement of sprinklers) to its Jones
Fork Mine (I.D. No. 15-17496) located in Knott County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to use a single overhead
pipe system with 1/2 inch orifice automatic sprinklers located on 10 feet centers to cover 50 feet of fire-resistant
belt or 150 feet of non-fire-resistant belt with actuation temperatures between 200 and 230 degrees fahrenheit with
water pressure equal to or greater than 10 psi. The petitioner states that the sprinklers would be located 10 feet apart
so that the discharge of water will extend over the belt drive, belt take-up, electrical control, and gear reducing
unit. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.



2. Cyprus Emerald Resources Corporation



[Docket No. M-94-61-C]



Cyprus Emerald Resources Corporation, 9100 East Mineral Circle, Englewood, Colorado 80112 has filed a petition
to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.507 (power connection points) to its Emerald Mine No. 1 (I.D. No. 36-05466)
located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use a non-permissible submersible pump in the
longwall bleeder sump near the No. 2 bleeder shaft for dewatering the sump and to provide unrestricted airflow into
the return shaft. The petitioner states that task training will be provided for all selected mine electricians who
will perform electrical work on these pumps; and that the surface pump control and power circuits will be examined
monthly. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection
as would the mandatory standard.



3. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-62-C]



Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 77.213 (draw-off tunnel escapeways) to its Cambria Cogeneration Facility (I.D. No. 36-08276)
located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to have an escapeway not less than 30 inches in diameter
from the tunnel within 24 feet of the tail roller at the closed end of the tunnel; to install a cable type heat detection
system set at 140 degrees fahrenheit in the enclosed portion of the tunnel; to install heat activated sprinklers in
the tunnel; to install a CO monitoring sensor in the tunnel near the tail roller to activate a visual alarm in the tail
roller area and in the Main and Fuel Handling Control rooms when a level of 30 ppm is reached; and to install a pull cord
throughout the tunnel to stop the belt. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at
least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



4. Misty Mountain Mining, Inc.



[Docket No. M-94-63-C]



Misty Mountain Mining, Inc., P.O. Box 517, Barbourville, Kentucky 40906 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.342 (methane monitors) to its Mine No. 2 (I.D. No. 15-17314) located in Knox County, Kentucky. The
petitioner proposes to monitor continuously with a hand-held deck-mounted methane and oxygen detector instead
of using a methane monitoring system on permissible three-wheel tractors with drag bottom buckets. The petitioner
asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory
standard.

5. Bell County Coal Corporation



[Docket No. M-94-64-C]



Bell County Coal Corporation, P.O. Box 758, Middlesboro, Kentucky 40965 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.360(b)(6) (preshift examination) to its Stone Mine No. 2 (I.D. No. 15-09568) located in Bell County,
Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points to monitor the air in areas that were mined prior
to the date new ventilation regulations went into effect. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method
would not jeopardize the safety of the miners at Stone Mine.



6. Tilden Magnetite Partnership



[Docket No. M-94-29-M]



Tilden Magnetite Partnership, P.O. Box 2000, Ishpeming, Michigan 49849 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 56/57.18010 (first aid training) to its Tilden Mine (I.D. No. 20-00422) located in Marquette County,
Michigan. The petitioner requests that the standard be modified to include Michigan State Certified Emergency Medical
Technicians and First Responders as equivalent to ``selected supervisors'' for the purpose of determining adequate
coverage of trained first aid personnel. The petitioner states that modification of the standard would allow for
the inclusion of those employees that have had advanced training and are currently licensed as Emergency Medical
Technicians or First Responders to be considered as part of the total number of trained first aid personnel and is not
meant to preclude the necessity of training additional members of the work force in standard first aid methods to assure
adequate coverage on all shifts. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least
the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



7. General Chemical Corporation



[Docket No. M-94-30-M]



General Chemical Corporation, Green River Soda Ash Operations, P.O. Box 551, Green River, Wyoming 82935-0551
has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.22305 (approved equipment III Mines) to its General Chemical
Mine (I.D. No. 48-00155) located in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The petitioner proposes to use Motorola Radio's
P200, Model 

#

H43RFU7160BN, 2.5-5 watts for communication purposes while riding the 

#

5 shaft emergency escape hoist for inspection purposes or when necessary to utilize this hoist in an emergency. The
petitioner states that the use of radios would allow personnel in the five-man bullet type hoist to have direct communication
with the hoistman or a shaft hand that will bell signals to the hoistman; and that when using the radios in the shaft,
methane would be continuously monitored and when 0.5 percent or more of methane is found, use of the radios would be
suspended until the methane level was below 0.5 percent. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method
would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



8. Mitsubishi Cement Corporation



[Docket No. M-94-31-M]



Mitsubishi Cement Corporation, 5808 State Hwy. 18, Lucerne Valley, California 92356 has filed a petition to modify
the application of 30 CFR 57.13020 (use of compressed air) to its Cushenbury Plant (I.D. No. 04-00157) located
in San Bernardino County, California. The petitioner proposes to establish blow-off stations at various places
in the plant where employees can clean their clothes with compressed air. This compressed air would have an OSHA-approved
nozzle with pressure no greater than 2-6 psi at normal average line pressure. The petitioner proposes to install
tamper-proof airline regulators at each station to ensure that primary operating air pressure is consistent; and
to post rules for employees to follow when using compressed air to clean their clothes. The petitioner asserts that
the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.



9. Cominco Alaska Incorporated



[Docket No. M-94-32-M]



Cominco Alaska Incorporated, P.O. Box 1230, Kotzebue, Alaska 99752 has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 56.6306(b) (loading and blasting) to its Red Dog Mine (I.D. No. 50-01545) located in Northwest Arctic,
Alaska. The petitioner proposes to charge blast holes immediately after the drill has completed drilling a blasthole
and has moved to the next hole location. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would enhance the
safety of the miners at Red Dog Mine.



Request for Comments



Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments. These comments must be filed with the Office
of Standards, Regulations and Variances, Mine Safety and Health Administration, room 627, 4015 Wilson Boulevard,

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Limitation of Exchange Liability for Negligent Conduct



May 27, 1994.



On December 23, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to limit the Exchange's liability in connection with its administration of proprietary indexes
and products. Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on April 1, 1994.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal.







The Exchange currently has listed for trading, or has received approval to trade, options on several broad-based
and narrow-based stock indexes.
 The Exchange represents that there is a great deal of work involved in the daily calculation and dissemination of these
index values and while much of this work is automated, a substantial amount of manual input is still required. Human
error, such as incorrectly inputting a symbol or index value, overlooking a corporate action, or inaccurately reporting
the number of outstanding shares of a component of an index, can occur during the manual input of data which exposes
the Exchange to potential liability. As options on more new indexes are introduced, the chances for human error increase,
thus exposing the Exchange to an even greater risk of liability.





Currently, Amex Rules 902C and 1003 disclaim Exchange liability regarding the calculation or dissemination of any
index value, and in the creation, redemption, and trading of Portfolio Depositary Receipts, respectively. These
disclaimers cover errors, omissions, and delays resulting from any conduct beyond the reasonable control of the
Exchange, and include acts of God, power or systems failure, or any error, omission, or delay in the reported price
of an underlying security. The Exchange believes, however, that these disclaimer provisions are arguably ambiguous
with respect to whether the Exchange remains potentially liable for damages caused by any human error or omission
by an Exchange employee in connection with the performance of the Exchange's index responsibilities.

In view of the increased potential for Exchange liability as a result of the Exchange's expanding role in the administration
of new proprietary indexes and products, the Amex wishes to make clear that in addition to the areas specified in Rules
902C and 1003, the Exchange also disclaims liability for negligent conduct. The Exchange represents that the Amex,
as well as other self-regulatory organizations, currently disclaim liability for negligent conduct associated
with the dissemination of their market data to vendors, as well as generally in connection with the use of their facilities,
except as they otherwise provide. The exchange believes that it is inappropriate for exchanges to bear the risks and
liabilities associated with the use of such information and facilities. In the area of index administration, the
Exchange represents that Standard & Poor's and all the other major index providers likewise routinely disclaim
liability for any negligent conduct.
 Additionally, the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has a rule which is substantively similar to the Exchange's
proposed rule change.
 Finally, the Exchange acknowledges that Rules 902C and 1003 cannot be relied upon by the Exchange to limit its liability
to non-members or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws.








The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change provides the Exchange with virtually the same protection
from liability available to the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to NYSE Rule 702(b). Additionally, because the Amex
represents that the proposed rule change cannot be used to limit its liability to non-members arising from negligent
conduct or for any intentional or negligent violation of federal securities laws,
 the Commission believes that the proposal may serve to facilitate transactions in securities, while also protecting
investors and the public interest. Specifically, entities such as the Amex may be encouraged to continue to calculate
and disseminate index values so that derivative products based on these indexes, which are found to provide hedging
or other economic functions, will remain available to investors.






It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-93-41), is approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Relating
to Amendments to its Listing Fees




May 31, 1994.





Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 72s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 3, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 





The Amex is proposing to reduce the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock issues. The fee is proposed
to be amended as follows:






 140. Original Listing Fees






Stock Issues



Less than 1 million shares 
$5,000
1+ ^ 2 million shares 
10,000
2+ ^ 3 million shares 
15,000
3+ ^ 4 million shares 
17,500
4+ ^ 5 million shares 
20,000
5+ ^ 6 million shares 
22,500
6+ ^ 7 million shares 
25,000
7+ ^ 8 million shares 
27,500
8+ ^ 9 million shares 
30,000
9+ ^ 10 million shares 
32,500
10+ ^ 15 million shares 
37,500
15+ million shares 
45,000
[15+ ^ 25 million shares 
47,500
25+ ^ 50 million shares 
72,500
50+ ^ 75 million shares 
97,500
75+ ^ 100 million shares 
122,500



All Shares over 100 million ^1/10 cents per share (no maximum)]






In addition to the above per-share fee, there is a one-time charge of $5,000 for companies that do not have a stock or
warrant issue listed on the Exchange. (The one-time charge of $5,000 does not apply to any company which previously
paid the one-time charge in connection with the listing of a debt issue.)



[There is no maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock and warrant issues, except] 

I

 [i]n the case of non-U.S. companies listed on foreign stock exchanges[.]

, 

[For such issues,] the fee, including the one-time charge, will be 50% of the rates set forth above, with a maximum fee
of [$30,000] $25,000. Where the original listing of more than one class of stock is included in the same application,
the fee is based on the aggregate number of shares of all such classes.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change





In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the fee
increase and discussed any comments it received on the fee increase. The text of these statements may be examined at
the places specified in Item IV below. The Exchange has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.




A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




(1) Purpose





When an issuer applies for listing on the Exchange, an original listing fee is levied on the company based on the total
number of shares to be listed. Currently, the fee ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares
to more than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already
have securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers
listed on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50% of the rates for U.S. companies, including the one-time charge,
with maximum of $30,000.



Based upon discussions with prospect companies, the Exchange believes that each year several large companies elect
not to list on the Amex because the expense of the Exchange's listing fee can become significant at the upper end of the
scale.



The Exchange is therefore proposing to amend section 140 of its Company Guide to provide that the maximum fee applicable
to the original listing of stock issues is $50,000, inclusive of the one-time charge of $5,000. To be consistent, the
Exchange is proposed to reduce the maximum listing fee for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from
$30,000 to $25,000.



The Exchange notes that Nasdaq/NMS original listing fees are roughly comparable to the Exchange's current fees,
although their fees are already capped at $50,000 (also inclusive of a $5,000 one-time fee for new listings).








(2) Statutory Basis





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market.




B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition





The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will remove or lessen an existing burden on competition in that
it proposes to reduce an existing difference between the Exchange's original listing fees and those charged by Nasdaq.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed fee increase that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed fee increase between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-12

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Temporary Suspensions
of Trading in Options</DOCTITLE>


May 27, 1994.


On October 20, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to provide
limited authority to Post Directors, Order Book Officials (``OBOs''), and under certain circumstances, Designated
Primary Market-Makers (``DPMs''), to suspend trading in a class of options for a limited period of time. Notice of
the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On April 11, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the
proposed rule change.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.







The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 6.3 (``Trading Halts'') to authorize, with respect to a particular class of options,
the Post Director
 or OBO to suspend trading in the options class for a period of time not to exceed five minutes whenever trading in the
underlying security is halted. This limited authority may be exercised only if the trading halt in the underlying
security is evidenced by an ``ST'' symbol (for an exchange-listed security) or an ``H'' (for a National Market security
traded through the NASDAQ system) appearing on the class display screen that displays current market information
for the underlying security, or if such trading halt is otherwise verified by the senior person in charge of the Exchange's
Control Room. The proposed rule change applies only in the circumstance where there has been a trading halt in an underlying
security, and has no application to ``circuit breaker'' trading halts under Rule 6.3A.




Concurrently with any suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible Post Director
or OBO shall turn off the Retail Automatic Execution System applicable to the affected options class or classes. Additionally,
the Post Director or OBO shall disseminate the designation 998-999 on the Exchange's quote reporting system,
which indicates the option is not trading on the CBOE.
Prior to the expiration of any temporary suspension imposed pursuant to the proposed rule change, the responsible
Post Director or OBO is required to notify two Floor Officials in order to obtain a determination by them whether a trading
halt in the effected options class should be declared under Rule 6.3(a). If the two Floor Officials determine not to
halt trading, immediately following such determination it shall be announced to the crowd and trading (or a rotation
in the option) shall in no event resume more than five minutes after the temporary suspension of trading was implemented.
The Post Director or OBO may only invoke a single five minute suspension of trading pursuant to the proposed rule change.





The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5),
 in that it is designed to protect the mechanism of a free and open market and to protect investors and the public interest.
Specifically, the Commission finds that the proposal will protect investors and the public interest by enabling
Post Directors and OBOs to temporarily suspend options trading promptly in response to verified trading halts in
underlying securities. Pursuant to the current version of Rule 6.3(a), Floor Officials have the authority to halt
trading in any options class for a period not in excess of two consecutive business days if trading in the underlying
security has been halted in the primary market. The proposed rule change, therefore, merely bridges the gap that currently
exists between the time that trading in an underlying security is halted and the time it takes for the Floor Officials
to impose a trading halt in the related options class pursuant to their authority under Rule 6.3(a). Additionally,
a temporary trading suspension pursuant to the proposed rule change can only be invoked once during a single occurrence
of a halt in trading in the underlying security. If two Floor Officials determine not to institute a trading halt pursuant
to Rule 6.3(a), or if a decision is not made by two Floor Officials within the five minute period, trading in the options
class will immediately resume and will continue unless two Floor Officials subsequently independently decide to
invoke a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change protects
investors and the public interest by providing a means for an immediate trading halt in those circumstances where
Floor Officials would be likely to impose a trading halt pursuant to Rule 6.3(a). Moreover, because the conditions
under which the five minute halt can be invoked are specific and objective, the Commission does not expect that the
rule change will increase the likelihood of abuse in the implementation of trading halts.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 removes the DPM as one of the persons authorized to impose a temporary suspension of
trading. Because the DPM performs market making functions, in addition to having the responsibilities of an OBO,
the Commission believes it would be inappropriate for a DPM to be able to suspend trading in a class of options for any
period of time. Amendment No. 1 also makes certain clarifications to the proposed rule language. The Commission believes
that these clarifications will minimize any potential for confusion as to the application of the rule. As a result,
the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the File Number SR-CBOE-93-47 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994.
It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CBOE-93-47) is approved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of
Amendment No. 1 to a Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing of Regular
and Long-Term Index Options on the S&P/Barra Growth Index and the S&P/Barra Value Index</DOCTITLE>


May 27, 1994.


I. Introduction


On September 9, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of regular and long-term index options on the S&P/Barra
Growth Index (``Growth Index'') and the S&P/Barra Value Index (``Value Index'') (each individually an ``Index,''
and collectively the ``Indexes''). The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on November 19, 1993.
 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. On May 25, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change.
 This order approves the Exchange's proposal, as amended.








II. Description of Proposal


A. General


The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Growth and Value Indexes, stock indexes calculated by Standard & Poor's
(``S&P'') (or its designee) and maintained by Barra, Inc. (``Barra'') pursuant to a license agreement between
Barra and S&P. The CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``Index LEAPS'') on either the full-value of
each Index or reduced-value Growth and Value Indexes that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the respective
Indexes. Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will trade independent of and in additional to regular options
on the Indexes traded on the Exchange, however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and
regular options on the Indexes will be aggregated.

B. Composition and Maintenance of the Index



The Indexes are constructed by sorting the stocks in the S&P 500 Index on the basis of their book-to-price ratios
as determined by Barra twice per year, based on end-of-day information on November 30 and May 31. Starting with the
company with the highest book-to-price ratio, companies are added to the Value Index until that Index contains 50%
of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 Index. The Growth Index is composed of the remaining companies in the
S&P 500 Index. The partition of the S&P 500 Index using November 30 information becomes effective as of January
1 of the following year; the partition of the S&P 500 Index using May 31 information becomes effective July 1 of
the same year.

Based on the last partition of the S&P 500 Index, effective January 1, 1994, the Value Index is currently composed
of 310 securities. As of the close of trading on May 3, 1994, the Value Index was valued at 71.65. The market capitalizations
of the individual stocks in the Value Index ranged from a high of $76.05 billion to a low of $97.23 million, with the mean
and median being $5.27 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the
Value Index was $1.63 trillion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Value Index ranged from
a high of 1.24 billion shares to a low of 8.94 million shares. The price per share of the stocks in the Value Index on that
date ranged from a high of $146.13 to a low of $4.00. Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 4.65% of the Value Index's
total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Value Index accounted for 15.19% of the Index's
value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted stock was 0.01% of the Index and the percentage weighting of
the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 0.05% of the Value Index's value.

Based on the last partition of the S&P 500 Index, effective January 1, 1994, the Growth Index is currently composed
of the 190 S&P 500 Index securities not included in the Value Index. As of the close of trading on May 3, 1994, the
Growth Index was valued at 60.47. The market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Growth Index ranged from
a high of $82.09 billion to a low of $506.63 million, with the mean and median being $8.43 billion and $4.28 billion,
respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the Growth Index was $1.60 trillion. The total number
of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Growth Index ranged from a high of 2.30 billion shares to a low of 14.46 million
shares. The price per share of the stocks in the Growth Index on that date ranged from a high of $736.00 to a low of $4.50.
Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 5.12% of the Growth Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the
five largest issues in the Growth Index accounted for 19.47% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the
lowest weighted stock was 0.03 % of the Growth Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the
Index accounted for 0.19% of the Index's value.

C. Calculation of the Index



Like the S&P 500 Index, the Indexes will be capitalization-weighted, and the methodology used to calculate their
value is identical to the methodology used to calculate the value of the S&P 500 Index. The level of each Index is
calculated as follows:








The numeric value of each Index was established at 10 as of the close of the market on December 31, 1974.



The Indexes are calculated continuously by S&P or its designee, and their values will be disseminated by the Options
Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') no less often than every fifteen seconds. S&P will also calculate the exercise
settlement value for each expiring series of Value Index options and Growth Index options, and will make these values
available to CBOE for use by the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') in effecting settlement of exercises and
assignments of the options.

The values of the Indexes, for purposes of settling outstanding options on the Growth and Value Indexes upon expiration,
will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Indexes' component stocks on the last
trading day prior to expiration.
 Once all of the component stocks have opened, the value of each Index will be determined and that value will be used as
the final settlement value for expiring options contracts on that Index. If any of the component stocks do not open
for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the last reported sale price of such security will be used
in any case where that security does not trade on that day.







D. Contract Specifications



The proposed options on the Indexes will be cash-settled, European-style options.
 Standard options trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time) will apply to the contracts. The multiplier for
each Index will be 100. The strike price interval will be $2.50 for Index options with strike prices of less than $200.
 The Exchange intends to list up to three near-term calendar months and three additional calendar months at three month
intervals.
 As described in more detail below, the Exchange also intends to list Index LEAPS on each Index that will expire 12 to
36 months from the date of their issuance.







Options on each Index (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS) will expire on the Saturday following
the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). Because options on the Indexes will settle based
upon the opening prices of the component stocks on the last trading day before expiration (normally a Friday), the
last trading day for an expiring Index option series will normally be the second to the last business day before expiration
(normally a Thursday).






E. Listing of Long-Term Options on the Full-Value or Reduced-Value Growth and Value Indexes



The Exchange may list Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes that expire 12 to 36 months from date of issuance on
either the full-value of the Growth and Value Indexes or reduced-values of the Indexes that will be computed at one-tenth
the value of the full-value Indexes.
 The current and closing values for reduced-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes will be computed by dividing the value
of the full-value Index by 10 and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest one-hundredth. For example, a Growth
Index value of 60.54 would be 6.05 for the Growth Index LEAPS and 60.56 would become 6.06. The reduced-value Index LEAPS
on the Indexes will have a European-style exercise and will be subject to the same rules that govern the trading of all
the Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements and floor trading procedures.
The strike price interval for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will be no less than $2.50.

<DOCNO> FR940606-2-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940606-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The same Exchange rules which are applicable to the trading of full-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes will be applicable
to the trading of reduced-value Index LEAPS on the Indexes. For example, both full-value and reduced-value Index
LEAPS may expire from 12 to 36 months from the date of issuance, and there may be up to six expiration months beyond one
year to expiration. Moreover, full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS on either Index may be issued at six month intervals
and new strike prices will either be near or bracketing the current value of each Index. Strike price interval, bid/ask
differential, and continuity rules will not apply to the trading of the full-value or reduced-value Index LEAPS on
the Indexes until their time to expiration is less than 12 months.
 Lastly, Index LEAPS series on each Index may be added when the value of the underlying Index increases or decreases
by ten to fifteen percent.
 
 





F. Position and Exercise Limits, Margin Requirements, and Trading Halts 
 


Position limits for the options (including Index LEAPS) on the Growth and Value Indexes will be set at no more than 125,000
contracts on the same side of the market, provided that no more than 75,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest
expiration month, and further provided that options positions in the Indexes will be aggregated.
 Exercise limits will be set at the same level as position limits.
 For purposes of calculating applicable position and exercise limits, positions in reduced-value options on the
Growth and Value Indexes will be aggregated with each other and with positions in the full-value Index options. For
these purposes, ten reduced-value contracts will equal one full-value contract for purposes of aggregating these
positions. Also, CBOE hedge exemption provisions will apply to options and Index LEAPS on both Indexes.
 
 






Exchange rules applicable to options on the Growth and Value Indexes will be identical to the rules applicable to other
broad-based index options for purposes of trading rotations, halts, and suspensions,
 and margin treatment.
 
 





G. Surveillance 
 


The Exchange will use the same surveillance procedures currently utilized for each of the Exchange's other index
options to monitor trading in Index options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes. These procedures include
complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities. 
 


H. Disclaimer 
 


The CBOE has agreed with S&P to revise the disclaimer of liability on behalf of S&P that is currently in the
Exchange's rules so that it covers Barra as well as S&P, and the growth Index and Value Index. The disclaimer would
provide that S&P, Barra, and all of their affiliates do not make any warranties as to the results obtained from
the Growth and Value Indexes, any opening, intra-day or closing value therefore, any related data, or any errors or
delays in calculating or disseminating the value of either Index, in connection with the trading of option contracts
based on the Indexes.
 
 




III. Commission Findings and Conclusions 
 


The Commission has reviewed the proposal to list and trade options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS on
the Growth and Value Indexes. As discussed below, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange.
In particular, the Indexes are broad-based, the proposed options are designed to reduce the potential for manipulation,
and the proposal to list and trade options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes is consistent with the CBOE's
obligation to promote investor protection.

The Commission finds that the trading of options on the Indexes, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS,
will permit investors to participate in the price movements of the securities on which the respective Indexes are
based. Further, trading of options on each Index will allow investors holding positions in some or all of the securities
underlying that Index to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. Accordingly, the Commission, believes
options on the Growth and Value Indexes will provide investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that
should reflect accurately the overall movement of the securities contained in this partition of the S&P 500 Index.
By broadening the hedging and investment opportunities of investors, the Commission believes that the trading of
options on the Growth and Value Indexes will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and contribute
to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.






The trading of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including the trading of full-value and reduced-value Index
LEAPS, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance,
and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the DBOE has addressed these concerns
adequately.



A. Index Design and Structure


The Commission finds that the Indexes are broad-based indexes,
 and thus it is appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply
to options on the Indexes, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Indexes are broad-based
because they (1) are a partition of the S&P 500 Index, which is a broad-based index on which options have been approved
for trading since 1983,
 and (2) reflect a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market.






The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the component
stocks of each Index significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of either Index. First, the Indexes collectively
represent and consist of the common stock values of 500 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular
stock or group of stocks dominates either Index. Specifically, as of May 3, 1994, no one stock comprised more than 4.65%
of the Value Index's total value or 5.12% of the Growth Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five
largest issues in the Indexes accounted for 15.19% of the Value Index's value and 19.47% of the Growth Index's value.
Third, the market capitalizations of the stocks in the Indexes are very large. Specifically, the market capitalizations
(1) for the Value Index ranged from a high of $76.05 billion to a low of $97.23 million as of May 3, 1994, with the mean and
median being $5.27 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively, and (2) for the Growth Index ranged from a high of $82.09
billion to a low of $506.63 million as of that date, with the mean and median being $8.43 billion and $4.28 billion, respectively.
Fifth, each Index is comprised of stocks representing a diverse group of industries, including, among others, pharmaceuticals,
communications, entertainment, various consumer and computer products and services. Sixth, an overwhelming proportion
of the component stocks in each Index currently are eligible for options trading.
 Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those
securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving options on the Indexes.





B. Customer Protection


The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the
trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading
of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things;
that: (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating
and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable
to options accounts. Accordingly, because the options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will be subject
to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes
that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes.


C. Surveillance


The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a
stock index derivative product and the exchanges trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important
measure for the surveillance of the derivatives and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability
of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the
stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation.
 In this regard, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''), which currently are the primary markets for all of the component
securities in the Indexes, are members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information.

D. Market Impact


The Commission believes that the listing and trading on the CBOE of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including
full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will not adversely impact the underlying securities markets.
 First, as described above, the Indexes are broad-based and each is presently comprised of at least 190 stocks with
no one stock dominating either Index. Second, as noted above, the stocks contained in the Indexes have large capitalizations
and are actively traded. Third, the proposed position and exercise limits, coupled with the requirement that positions
in both Indexes be aggregated, will serve to minimize potential manipulation and market impact concerns. Fourth,
the risk to investors of contra-party non-performance will be minimized because the Index options will be issued
and guaranteed by the OCC just like any other standardized option traded in the United States. Fifth, existing CBOE
stock index options rules and surveillance procedures will apply to options on the Growth and Value Indexes.




Lastly, the Commission believes that settling expiring options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value
and reduced-value Index LEAPS) based on the opening prices of component securities is reasonable and consistent
with the Act. As noted in other contexts, valuing expiring index options for exercise settlement purposes based on
opening prices rather than closing prices may help reduce adverse effects on the securities underlying options on
the Indexes.





The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication
of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. Specifically, Amendment No. 1 maintains the proposed options position limits on the Indexes but requires that positions
in options on the Indexes (including Index LEAPS) be aggregated for purposes of position and exercise limits. As stated
above, the Commission believes that these position and exercise limits have the effect of minimizing the potential
for market manipulation and other adverse impacts on the market for the securities underlying the Indexes as a result
of the trading of options on the Indexes. Amendment No. 1 also clarifies that strike intervals of $2.50 will only be
used for strike prices of less than $200 for full-value options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes. This amendment merely
conforms the proposal to existing CBOE rules.
 As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis.




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1. Persons making
written submissions, should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to the File Number SR-CBOE-93-36 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994.
It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
, that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-36) is approved, as amended.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Proposed
Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading Options on the Israeli
Index </DOCTITLE>



May 31, 1994. 



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on December 8, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Exchange filed Amendment
No. 1 to the proposed rule change on April 29, 1994, and Amendment No. 2 on May 12, 1994.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.








I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



As provided in Exchange Rule 24.2, ``Designation of the Index,''
 the CBOE proposes to list for trading options on the Israeli Index (``Index''). The text of the proposed rule change
is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission. 





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the Exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list and trade cash-settled, European-style
 index options on the Israeli Index (``Index''). The Index will initially consist of fourteen stocks issued by Israeli
companies, and one American Depositary Receipt (``ADR'')
 overlying an Israeli company.
 According to the Exchange, no proxy for the performance of the Israeli economy is currently available in the U.S. derivative
markets. Therefore, the Exchange believes, options on the Index will provide investors with a low-cost means of participating
in the performance of the Israeli economy or to hedge against the risk of investing in that economy. 







Index Design 



One of the components of the Index currently trades on the New York Stock Exchange and fourteen (including one ADR representing
11.37% of the weight of the Index as of March 31, 1994) currently are National Market securities traded through the
facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (``NASDAQ''). The
14 non-ADR components of the Index are listed for trading only in the United States, and for the ADR component,
more than 50% of the combined world-wide trading volume for the ADR and the underlying security occurs in the U.S. through
NASDAQ.
 Accordingly, the Exchange believes that options on the Index should not raise the types of surveillance concerns
that may be raised by options on an index of non-U.S. traded stocks.

<PARENT> FR940606-2-00059 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

As of March 31, 1994, the securities comprising the Index ranged in market capitalization from a low of $124.11 million
to a high of $2.08 billion. The average capitalization as of that date was $566.83 million. The component accounting
for the largest percentage of the total weighting of the Index on that date was Elbit Ltd. (13.12%), while the smallest
was Biotechnology General Corp. (1.92%).




Calculation




The Index is price-weighted and reflects changes in the prices of the component stocks relative to the base date of
January 2, 1992. The Index value is calculated by summing the prices of the component securities and then dividing
by a divisor that yielded an index value of 100.00 as of that date.


The Index will be calculated by CBOE or its designee on a real-time basis using last-sale prices and will be disseminated
every 15 seconds by the Exchange. If a component stock of the Index is not currently being traded, the most recent price
at which the stock traded will be used in the Index calculation.



Maintenance




The Index will be maintained by the Exchange. To maintain continuity in the Index following an adjustment to a component
security, the divisor will be adjusted. Changes which may result in divisor changes include, but are not limited to,
spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions.


The Exchange states that the Index will be reviewed on approximately a monthly basis by the CBOE staff. The Exchange
may change the composition of the Index at any time or from time to time to reflect the changes affecting the components
of the Index or the Israeli economy generally. If it becomes necessary to remove a stock from the Index (generally due
to a takeover or merger), every effort will be made to add to the Index an Israeli stock that is traded in the U.S. and not
in Israel. (According to the Exchange, there are currently 46 Israeli stocks trading in the United States, of which
five are also traded in Israel.) In such circumstances, CBOE will take into account the capitalization, liquidity,
volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement stock. The Exchange will most likely maintain fifteen
stocks in the Index at all times.







Long-Term Index Options




In addition to Index options on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange also proposes to list long-term Index option
series (``LEAPS'') as provided in CBOE Rule 24.9, and reduced-value Index LEAPS for which the underlying value would
be computed at one-tenth (1/10th) of the value of the Index. The current and closing index value of any such reduced-value
Index LEAPS will, after such initial computation, be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Other than the reduced
value, all other specifications and calculations for the reduced-value Index LEAPS will remain the same.



Exercise and Settlement




Index options will have European-style exercise and will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' within the meaning of
the rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules.
 The CBOE proposes to amend Rule 24.9 to refer specifically to Israeli Index options. The Exchange states that the proposed
Index options would expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration month. Thus, the last day for
trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily a Thursday) preceding the expiration date.






Exchange Rules Applicable





Except as modified in the proposal, the Rules in Chapter XXIV of the Exchange's rules regarding narrow-based or industry
indexes will be applicable to Index options. Index option contracts based on the Israeli Index will be subject to position
limits on 7,500 contracts on the same side of the market pursuant to CBOE Rule 24.4A. For purposes of position and exercise
limits Index LEAPS will be aggregated with Index options on a one for one basis. Under the proposal, ten reduced-value
Index LEAPS contracts will equal one full-value Index option or Index LEAPS for purposes of aggregating positions.
The Exchange represents that it has the necessary systems capacity to support new options series that would result
from the introduction of Israeli Index options and Index LEAPS.

<TEXT>
 

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6 of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, and thereby will provide investors with the ability to invest in options based
on an additional index.




(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Exchange consents, the Commission
will:



(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the CBOE.
All submissions should refer to File No. SR-CBOE-93-55 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting
Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 4 to a Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Size of Orders Eligible for Entry
in the Auto-Ex System</DOCTITLE>


May 27, 1994.


On October 15, 1993, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to permit the PSE's Options Floor Trading Committee (``OFTC'') to increase, in one or more classes
of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders eligible for entry into the PSE's Automatic Execution System
(``Auto-Ex'') to the extent necessary to match the size of orders eligible for entry into any other exchange's automated
execution system.
 Notice of the proposed rule change appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993.
 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The PSE subsequently filed Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed
rule change on December 21, 1993, Amendment No. 3 on March 28, 1994, and Amendment No. 4 on May 25, 1994.
 This order approves the proposal, as amended.








The PSE proposal adds Commentary .01 to PSE Rule 6.87(a) relating to the operation of Auto-Ex in equity options. Interpretation
.01 would permit the OFTC to increase, in one or more classes of multiply-traded equity options, the size of orders
eligible for entry into Auto-Ex to the extent that other options exchanges permit such larger-size orders in multiply-traded
equity options of the same class or classes to be entered into their own automated execution systems.
 The proposal further provides that any such increase in the order eligibility size will be conditioned on PSE's filing
the specific terms of the increase for immediate effectiveness under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposal
requires that the PSE include in any such filing, representations that Auto-Ex has the capacity to accommodate the
increase in the order eligibility size. Such representations shall cover systems capacity as well as the market-making
capacity of market-makers participating in Auto-Ex.
 Any proposed increase that is initiated by the PSE and not made in response to matching an increase effectuated by another
market would have to be filed with the Commission for review under section 19(b) of the Act.





Finally, the proposal would add Rule 6.87(c) which would prohibit the splitting of orders for purposes of making the
parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex. The Exchange believes this is necessary in order to comply with the purpose
behind the Auto-Ex system which is to allow for the execution of small customer orders. Additionally, when large orders
are split and then routed through Auto-Ex, market makers do not have the opportunity to adjust their markets to reflect
the order flow. Finally, the PSE believes that this provision is consistent with the rule adopted by the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (``CBOE'') regarding orders routed through its Retail Automatic Execution System (``RAES'').





The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6 and 11A.
 Specifically, the Commission notes that the proposed rule change is substantively identical to a proposal recently
approved by the Commission relating to RAES at the CBOE.
 The Commission believes that the rationale supporting approval of the CBOE proposal applies equally to the PSE's
proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission continues to believe that the development and implementation
of the Auto-Ex system provides for more efficient handling and reporting of orders in PSE equity options through the
use of new data processing and communications techniques, thereby improving order processing and turnaround time.

<TEXT>
 


Further, the Commission believes that providing the PSE with an efficient method by which to increase Auto-Ex order
size eligibility to match another market's increase is consistent with sections 6(b)(5) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the
Act in that it facilitates transactions in securities and promotes fair competition among options markets by enhancing
the benefits available to investors of a multiple trading environment. The Commission also believes that the proposal
adequately protects investors and the public interest by conditioning the increase in order size eligibility on
the PSE's filing with the Commission, under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, of the specific terms of the increase.
The Commission believes that requiring the PSE to provide it with such a filing will provide sufficient opportunity
for the Commission to determine whether the PSE has adequate system and market maker capacity to accommodate the proposed
increase and request appropriate modification of the increase if necessary. Finally, the Commission notes that
the PSE has represented that Auto-Ex currently has adequate system and market-maker capacity to accommodate any
reasonably anticipated increase in order size eligibility.







Amendment No. 4 provides that orders may not be split for purposes of making the parts eligible for entry into Auto-Ex.
The Commission agrees with the Exchange that this is necessary in order to assure compliance with the purpose of Auto-Ex,
which is to allow for a more efficient method of executing small market and limit orders.
 Additionally, the rule change proposed in Amendment No. 4 is consistent with CBOE Rule 6.8(a)(i), which the Commission
previously approved.








The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day
after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

.
 For the reasons stated above, the Commission believes it is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment
No. 4 to the PSE's proposal on an accelerated basis.






Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4 to the proposed
rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments,
all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written
communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that
may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection
and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing
will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Exchange. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-PSE-93-26 and should be submitted by June 27, 1994.


It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-93-26) is approved, as amended.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the Proposed
Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options on the Phlx Phone
Index </DOCTITLE>

 

May 27, 1994. 

 

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 3, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the Phlx.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


 



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 

 

The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Phlx Phone Index (``Index''),
an index developed by the Phlx and comprised of eight common stocks representing the companies created as a result
of the divestiture of the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. (``AT&T'') in 1983, as well as AT&T itself.


 

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


 

In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 

 

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


 

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to list for trading an American-style option on the Index. The Index, which
is comprised of the common stocks of the eight companies created as a result of the divestiture of AT&T in 1983,
includes the seven regional telephone companies spun off from AT&T as well as AT&T. AT&T and the spun-off
regional telephone companies represent some of the largest and most widely-held U.S. common stocks. If at any time
the number of stocks comprising the Index increases to more than ten or decreases to less than eight, the Exchange will
submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Act prior to opening any new option series on
the Index. 

 The Phlx believes that there is a need for an index option that represents solely AT&T and its spun-off regional
telephone companies. In this regard, the Phlx states that there is a significant segment of the investing community
that avidly follows these companies. The Phlx believes that the Index, therefore, would fill a current market void
by creating a pure U.S. telephone industry index that would not be diluted with other telecommunications stocks.

The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The value of the Index was set to equal
200 on December 1, 1993. The formula for calculating the Index value is as follows:







Where:

 

Total Capitalization = Sum of Market Values (price x shares outstanding) for all component securities
Divisor = The number which, when divided from the total capitalization when the Index was initially calculated (on
December 1, 1993), yielded an Index value of 200



The Index divisor will be adjusted for changes in the capitalization of any of the component securities resulting
from mergers, acquisitions, delistings, substitutions, and other like corporate events. The formula for adjusting
the divisor is as follows:
Adjustments in the value of the Index which are necessitated by the addition and/or deletion of an issue from the Index
are made by adding and/or subtracting the market value (price x shares outstanding) of the relevant issues.
The Index value will be updated dynamically and disseminated at least once every 15 seconds during the trading day.
The Phlx has retained Bridge Data, Inc. to compute the value of the Index. Pursuant to Phlx Rule 1100A, updated Index
values will be disseminated and displayed by means of primary market prints reported by the Consolidated Tape Association
and over the facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority. The Index value also will be available on broker/dealer
interrogation devices to subscribers of the option information.







In accordance with Phlx Rule 1009A, if any change in the nature of any stock in the Index occurs as a result of delisting,
merger, acquisition, or otherwise, the Exchange will take appropriate steps to delete this stock from the Index and
replace it with another stock which the Exchange believes would be compatible with the intended market character
of the Index.
Index options will be traded pursuant to the current Phlx rules governing the trading of index options, particularly
Phlx Rules 1000A through 1103A, and generally, Phlx Rules 1000 through 1070.
Index options will be ``A.M.-settled index options'' and will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of
the expiration month, and the last day for trading in an expiring series will be the second business day (ordinarily
a Thursday) preceding the expiration date.
The Phlx proposes to employ position and exercise limits pursuant to Phlx Rule 1001A(b)(i) and 1002A, respectively.
 Exercise price intervals will be set initially at five point intervals, and additional exercise prices will be added
in accordance with Phlx Rule 1101A(a).

The Phlx will trade consecutive and cycle month series pursuant to Phlx Rule 1101A. Specifically, there will be three
expiration months from the March, June, September, December cycle plus two additional near-term months so that the
three nearest-term months always will be available. 
 
All of the component securities in the Index currently are eligible to have, and do have, overlying exchange traded
options on them. The Exchange represents that, if at any time less than 90 percent of the component securities, by weight,
are eligible for options trading, the Exchange will submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b-4
under the Act prior to opening any new series of options on the Index. 
 
The Exchange represents that surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's
other index options also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. These procedures include having complete
access to trading activity in the underlying securities comprising the Index, all of which are traded on the NYSE.
In addition, the Exchange represents that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement dated July 14, 1983, as amended
on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on the Index. 
 
The exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and with Section
6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate

<DOCTITLE>Order Adjusting International Cargo Rate Flexibility Level </DOCTITLE>



Policy Statement PS-109, implemented by Regulation ER-1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted
by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs
filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances. 

The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the
cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1,
1983. By Order 94-3-54, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments. 

In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on
the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 

By Order 94-5-41 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982
level:

<DOCTITLE>Order Adjusting the Standard Foreign Fare Level Index </DOCTITLE>



The International Air Transportation Competition Act (IATCA), Public Law 96-192, requires that the Department,
as successor to the Civil Aeronautics Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL
base periodically by percentage changes in actual operating costs per available seat-mile (ASM). Order 80-2-69
established the first interim SFFL, and Order 94-3-50 established the currently effective two-month
SFFL applicable through May 31, 1994. 

In establishing the SFFL for the two-month period beginning June 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based on
the year ended December 31, 1993 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 

By Order 94-5-40 fares may be increased by the following adjustment factors over the October 1979 level:

<ACTION>

 Notice of public hearing.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
will hold a joint public hearing to receive comments on the February 18, 1994, (59 FR 8357) notice addressing the joint
finding by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the average concentration of
respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be measured accurately over
a single shift. This hearing is being held pursuant to section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine
Act). The hearing will be held in Morgantown, West Virginia. 


This notice should be read in conjunction with the notice on noncompliance determinations published separately
by MSHA today elsewhere in the 

Federal Register

.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 18, 1994, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active
workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2)
of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the
finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972, which is discussed below. 


Concurrently, MSHA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements, and the average
of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples, to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations
of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. 

The comment periods for these notices were scheduled to close on April 19, 1994, but, in response to requests from the
mining community for additional time in which to prepare their comments, MSHA extended the comment period to May 20,
1994 (59 FR 16958). 

The purpose of the public hearing is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions concerning the notices.
The hearing will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA and NIOSH officials. Although formal rules of
evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly
progress of the hearing and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 

The hearing will begin with an opening statement from MSHA and NIOSH, followed by an opportunity for members of the
public to make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion
of the presiding official, speakers may be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations. In the interests
of conducting a productive hearing, MSHA and NIOSH will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view
to be heard as effectively as possible.

Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing
transcripts will be made available to the public for review. 

MSHA and NIOSH will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested
party, including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA or NIOSH will
be included in the rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments, the record will remain
open until August 5, 1994.
