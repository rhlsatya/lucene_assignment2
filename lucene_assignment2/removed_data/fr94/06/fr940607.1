Executive Office for Immigration Review; Motions and Appeals in Immigration Proceedings


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Justice.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule amends Executive Office for Immigration Review regulations concerning motion and appeal practice
in immigration proceedings. The rule is being promulgated to implement the directives of section 545 of the Immigration
Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''). Both time and number limitations on motions to reopen proceedings or to reconsider decisions
have been proposed in accordance with section 545(d) of IMMACT, and will reflect the intent of Congress to streamline
the deportation proceedings of aliens in the United States.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 545 of the Immigration Act of 1990, Public Law 101-649 (8 U.S.C. 1252b), modifies both substantive and
procedural aspects of motion and appeal practice in immigration proceedings. Under the proposed rule, a party may
file only one motion to reopen proceedings, and one motion to reconsider a decision of an Immigration Judge, the Board
of Immigration Appeals (``Board''), or a Service Officer. A motion to reopen proceedings must be filed within 20 days
of the final administrative decision or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.
A motion to reconsider a decision must also be filed within 20 days of the decision or within 20 days of the effective
date of the final rule, whichever is later. Under the proposed rule, provisions concerning motions to reopen or reconsider
have been condensed into one section under 8 CFR 3.2. A new  3.8 will concern fees.


The Board has previously addressed issues relating to the effect of an alien's loss of lawful permanent resident status
on a motion to reopen proceedings to apply for or to further pursue an application for relief under section 212(c) of
the Act. See 

e.g., Matter of Cerna, 

Interim Decision 3161 (BIA 1991) and 

Matter of Lok, 

18 I&N Dec. 101 (BIA 1981), 

aff'd on other grounds, Lok 

v. 

INS, 

681 F.2d 107 (2d Cir. 1982). These decisions have recently been the subject of litigation and conflicting court rulings.
Subject to all of the other requirements pertaining to motions to reopen, the proposed rule will permit reopening
of proceedings to consider or further consider an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act if the alien
demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final
order of deportation or exclusion.
There are several exceptions to these general rules, as required by section 242B(c)(3) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(c)(3).
An alien who is ordered deported 

in absentia 

who can demonstrate that his or her failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances may file a motion to reopen
the proceedings within 180 days of the final order. An alien who is ordered deported 

in absentia 

without receiving notice of the proceedings, if notice was required, or who was in federal or state custody at the time
of the proceedings and could not appear, may file a motion to reopen without regard to the above time limitations. The
filing of a motion to reopen proceedings or a motion to reconsider a decision will not serve to stay the execution of
any decision, unless the motion is filed by an alien who was ordered deported 

in absentia, 

pursuant to 8 CFR 3.23(b)(5). As in the past, an alien who files an asylum claim that arises after the initiation of deportation
proceedings against the alien where the claim is based upon an alleged change in circumstances in the country of the
alien's nationality may move to reopen the proceedings at any time.
When a party appeals a decision, the notice of appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in order
to avoid summary dismissal. The notice must indicate whether the party will be filing a brief and whether the party
desires oral argument before the Board. An appellant will be provided 30 days in which to file a brief unless the alien
concerned is detained, in which case the appellant will be given 14 days to file a brief. The Immigration Judge or Service
Officer may specify a shorter time in which to file a brief, but only the Board may extend the time for filing, and then
only up to a total of 90 days for good cause shown. An appeal may be withdrawn by either party. In the event the alien concerned
leaves the United States after taking an appeal but prior to a decision, the appeal will be deemed withdrawn. An appeal
will not be permitted when an order of deportation or exclusion has been entered 

in absentia.


The rule more clearly outlines when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service
and when the notice of appeal should be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge. The proposed rule also replaces
the reference to discontinued Form I-290A with reference to the currently used Form EOIR-26 for filing
an appeal from a decision of an Immigration Judge and Form EOIR-29 for filing an appeal from a decision of a district
director. The proposed change will eliminate the requirement that the notice of appeal be filed in triplicate. Parties
will still be required to file the original notice of appeal with the office having administrative control over the
record of proceeding and serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the opposing party. The proposed rule will clarify that
a notice of appeal will not be considered filed until the notice is actually received in the office having administrative
control over the record of proceeding.
The rule clarifies that the period for filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration
Judge (Form EOIR-26) is extended from 10 to 13 days where the decision of the Immigration Judge is served by mail.
The proposed change will clearly define the event that commences the running of the period for filing an appeal and
will reiterate which form should be used to file an appeal and where to file the form. These proposed changes will help
unify practice and procedure throughout the country and will restrict the ability of parties to reopen or continue
proceedings indefinitely. These goals are consistent with the directives of section 545 of IMMACT (8 U.S.C. 1252b).
This rule is promulgated as a proposed regulation to allow for comments prior to implementation.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866. In addition, this rule does not have Federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612.

 3.2

Reopening or reconsideration.



(a) 

General. 

The Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision. A request
to reopen or reconsider any case in which a decision has been made by the Board, which request is made by the Commissioner
or any other duly authorized officer of the Service, or by the party affected by the decision, must be in the form of a
written motion to the Board. The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion
of the Board, subject to the restrictions of this section. The Board has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if
the party moving has made out a 

prima facie

 case for relief.

(b) 

Motion to reconsider. 

A motion to reconsider a decision must be filed within 20 days after the mailing of the decision or the stating of the
oral decision for which reconsideration is being sought, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule,
whichever is later. When service of the decision is made by mail, 3 days shall be added to the period prescribed for filing
of the motion. A party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of
a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and
shall be supported by pertinent authority. A motion to reconsider a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or Service
Officer that is pending when an appeal is filed with the Board, or that is filed subsequent to the filing with the Board
of an appeal from the decision sought to be reconsidered, shall be deemed a motion to remand the decision for further
proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal was taken. Such motion,
which shall be consolidated with and considered by the Board in connection with any appeal to the Board, is subject
to the time and numerical limitations of this paragraph.

(c) 

Motion to reopen. 

(1) A motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is
granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. A motion to reopen proceedings for the
purpose of submitting an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and
all supporting documentation. A motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that
evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the
former hearing; nor shall any motion to reopen for the purpose of affording the alien an opportunity to apply for any
form of discretionary relief be granted if it appears that the alien's right to apply for such relief was fully explained
to him or her and an opportunity to apply therefor was afforded at the former hearing, unless the relief is sought on
the basis of circumstances that have arisen subsequent to the hearing. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions
of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for
relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible
for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must
be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding
sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.

(3) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2) shall not apply to a motion to reopen proceedings:

(i) Filed pursuant to the provisions of  3.23(b)(5) of this part.

(ii) To apply or reapply for asylum, or withholding of deportation, based on changed circumstances arising subsequent
to the commencement of proceedings in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered,
or

(iii) Agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed.

(4) A motion to reopen a decision rendered by an Immigration Judge or Service Officer that is pending when an appeal
is filed, or that is filed subsequent to the filing of an appeal to the Board from the proceedings sought to be reopened,
shall be deemed a motion to remand for further proceedings before the Immigration Judge or the Service Officer from
whose decision the appeal was taken. Such motion, which shall be consolidated with, and considered by the Board in
connection with, the appeal to the Board, is subject to the requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) and the time
and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (c)(2).

(d) 

Departure or deportation. 

A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of deportation
or exclusion proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. Any departure from the United
States, including the deportation of a person who is the subject of deportation or exclusion proceedings, occurring
after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.

(e) 

Judicial proceedings. 

Motions to reopen or reconsider shall state whether the validity of the deportation order has been or is the subject
of any judicial proceeding and, if so, the nature and date thereof, the court in which such proceeding took place or
is pending, and its result or status. In any case in which a deportation order is in effect, any motion to reopen or reconsider
such order shall include a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring whether the subject of the deportation
order is also the subject of any pending criminal proceeding under section 242(e) of the Act, and, if so, the current
status of that proceeding. If a motion to reopen or reconsider seeks discretionary relief, the motion shall include
a statement by or on behalf of the moving party declaring whether the alien for whose relief the motion is being filed
is subject to any pending criminal prosecution and, if so, the nature and current status of that prosecution.

(f) 

Stay of deportation. 

Except where a motion is filed pursuant to the provisions of  3.23(b)(5) of this part, the filing of a motion to
reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the execution of any decision made in the case. Execution of such decision
shall proceed unless a stay of execution is specifically granted by the Board, the Immigration Judge, or an authorized
officer of the Service.

(g) 

 Distribution of motion papers.

 A motion to reopen to a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board pertaining to proceedings before an Immigration
Judge shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding.
A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider a decision of the Board pertaining to a matter initially adjudicated by
an officer of the Service shall be filed with the officer of the Service having administrative control over the record
of proceeding; provided, however, that when a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider is made by the Commissioner
or any other duly authorized officer of the Service in proceedings in which the Service has administrative control
over the record of proceedings, the record of proceedings in the case and the motion shall be filed directly with the
Board. In all cases, the motion shall include proof of service on the opposing party and all attachments. The moving
party may only file a brief if it is included with the motion. The opposing party shall have ten days from the date of service
of the motion to submit a brief in opposition to the motion, which shall be filed with the Office where the motion was
filed, along with proof of service of a copy of the brief on the opposing party. The Board, in its discretion, may extend
the time within which such brief is to be submitted. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless a timely response is made.

(h) 

Oral argument.

 A request for oral argument, if desired, shall be incorporated in the motion to reopen or reconsider. The Board in its
discretion may grant or deny requests for oral argument.

(i) 

Ruling on motion.

 Rulings upon motions to reopen or motions to reconsider shall be by written order. If the order directs a reopening
and further proceedings are necessary, the record shall be returned to the Office of the Immigration Judge or the officer
of the Service having administrative control over the place where the reopened proceedings are to be conducted. If
the motion to reconsider is granted, the decision upon such reconsideration shall affirm, modify, or reverse the
original decision made in the case.

6. Section 3.3 is revised to read as follows:



 3.3 

Notice of appeal.



(a) A party affected by a decision who is entitled under this chapter to appeal to the Board shall be given notice of his
or her right to appeal. An appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the
Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26) with the Office of the Immigration
Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections
of this chapter. An appeal of a decision of a Service Officer shall be taken by filing a Notice of Appeal to the Board of
Immigration Appeals of Decision of District Director (Form EOIR-29) with the office of the Service having administrative
control over the record of proceeding, within the time specified in the governing sections of this chapter. A notice
of appeal of a decision of an Immigration Judge is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR-26 is actually
received in the appropriate Office of the Immigration Judge and the fee provisions of  3.8 of this part are satisfied.
A notice of appeal of a decision of a district director is not considered to be filed until the Form EOIR-29 is actually
received in the appropriate office of the Service and the fee provisions of  3.8 of this part are satisfied. The
certification of a case as provided in this part shall not relieve the party affected from compliance with the provisions
of this section in the event that he or she is entitled, and desires, to appeal from an initial decision, nor shall it
serve to extend the time specified in the applicable parts of this chapter for the taking of an appeal. Departure from
the United States of a person in deportation proceedings prior to the taking of an appeal from a decision in his or her
case shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to appeal.

(b) 

Items to be included in the Notice of Appeal.

 The party taking the appeal must meaningfully identify the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal in order to
avoid summary dismissal pursuant to  3.1(d)(1-a)(i) of this part. The statement on the notice of appeal
must specifically identify the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, or both, that are being challenged. If a question
of law is presented, supporting authority must be cited. If the dispute is over the findings of fact, the specific facts
contested must be identified. Where the appeal concerns discretionary relief, the appellant must state whether
the alleged error relates to statutory grounds of eligibility or to the exercise of discretion and must identify the
specific factual and legal finding or findings that are being challenged. In addition, the statement of the reasons
for appeal must be set forth with sufficient clarity and specificity that the Board may address the appeal without
first reviewing the record and constructing the arguments. The appellant must also indicate in the notice of appeal
whether he or she desires oral argument before the Board and whether he or she will be filing a separate written brief
or statement in support of the appeal.

(c) 

Briefs. 

Briefs in support of or in opposition to an appeal shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge or, where the
appeal is from a decision of a Service Officer, with the officer of the Service having administrative control over
the case. If the alien concerned is not detained, the appellant shall be provided 30 days in which to file a brief unless
a shorter period is specified by the Immigration Judge or by the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal is taken.
If the alien concerned is detained, the appellant shall be provided 14 days in which to file a brief, unless a shorter
period is specified by the Immigration Judge or by the Service Officer from whose decision the appeal is taken. The
appellee shall have the same period of time in which to file a reply brief that was initially granted to the appellant
to file his or her brief. The time to file a reply brief commences from the date upon which the appellant's brief was due,
as originally set or extended by the Board, or the date upon which such brief was filed, whichever is earlier. The Board,
upon motion, may extend the period for filing a brief or a reply brief for up to 90 days for good cause shown and may authorize
the filing of briefs directly with it. If, in its discretion, the Board determines that the interests of justice would
be served thereby, it may consider a brief filed out of time in its adjudication of an appeal. All briefs and motions
regarding the filing of briefs shall include proof of service of the brief or motion on the opposing party.

7. Section 3.4 is revised to read as follows:



 3.4

Withdrawal of appeal.



In any case in which an appeal has been taken, the party taking the appeal may file a written withdrawal thereof with
the office at which the notice of appeal was filed. If the record in the case has not been forwarded to the Board on appeal
in accordance with  3.5 of this part, the decision made in the case shall be final to the same extent as if no appeal
had been taken. If the record has been forwarded on appeal, the withdrawal of the appeal shall be forwarded to the Board
and, if no decision in the case has been made on the appeal, the record shall be returned and the initial decision shall
be final to the same extent as if no appeal had been taken. If a decision on the appeal shall have been made by the Board
in the case, further action shall be taken in accordance therewith. Departure from the United States of a person who
is the subject of deportation proceedings subsequent to the taking of an appeal but prior to a decision thereon shall
constitute a withdrawal of the appeal and the initial decision in the case shall be final to the same extent as though
no appeal had been taken.

8. Section 3.5 is revised to read as follows:



 3.5

Forwarding of record on appeal.



If an appeal is taken from a decision, as provided in this chapter, the entire record of proceeding shall be forwarded
to the Board by the office having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon timely receipt of the briefs of the
parties, or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of such briefs. After an appeal to the Board has been
filed, a district director or regional service center director need not forward such appeal to the Board, but may reopen
and reconsider any decision made by the director, if the director's new decision will grant the benefit that has been
requested in the appeal, provided that the director's new decision must be served on the appealing party within 45
days of receipt of any briefs or upon expiration of the time allowed for the submission of any briefs. If the director's
new decision is not served within these time limits or the appealing party does not agree that the new decision disposes
of the matter, the record of proceeding shall be immediately forwarded to the Board.

9. Section 3.6 is revised to read as follows:



 3.6

Stay of execution of decision.



(a) Except as provided under  242.2(d) of this chapter and paragraph (b) of this section, the decision in any
proceeding under this chapter from which an appeal to the Board may be taken shall not be executed during the time allowed
for the filing of an appeal unless a waiver of the right to appeal is filed, nor shall such decision be executed while
an appeal is pending or while a case is before the Board by way of certification.

(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an order of an Immigration Judge under  3.23
or  242.22 of this chapter denying a motion to reopen or reconsider or to stay deportation, except where such
order expressly grants a stay or where the motion was filed pursuant to the provisions of  3.23(b)(5). The Board
may, in its discretion, stay deportation while an appeal is pending from any such order if no stay has been granted by
the Immigration Judge or a Service officer.

10. Section 3.7 is revised to read as follows:



 3.7



Notice of certification.



Whenever, in accordance with the provisions of  3.1(c) of this part, a case is required to be certified to the
Board, the alien or other party affected shall be given notice of certification. An Immigration Judge or Service Officer
may certify a case only after an initial decision has been made and before an appeal has been taken. If it is known at the
time the initial decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the notice of certification shall be included
in such decision and no further notice of certification shall be required. If it is not known until after the initial
decision is rendered that the case will be certified, the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having
administrative control over the record of proceeding shall cause a Notice of Certification to be served upon the parties.
In either case, the notice shall inform the parties that the case is required to be certified to the Board and that they
have the right to make representations before the Board, including the making of a request for oral argument and the
submission of a brief. If either party desires to submit a brief, it shall be submitted to the office of the Service or
Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding for transmittal to the
Board within the time prescribed in  3.3(c) of this part. The case shall be certified and forwarded to the Board
by the office of the Service or Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative jurisdiction over the case upon
receipt of the brief, or upon the expiration of the time within which the brief may be submitted, or upon receipt of a
written waiver of the right to submit a brief. The Board in its discretion may elect to accept for review or not accept
for review any such certified case. If the Board declines to accept a certified case for review, the underlying decision
shall become final on the date of the Board's declination.

11. Section 3.8 is revised to read as follows:



 3.8



Fees.



Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart by any person other
than an officer of the Service relating to a proceeding held before an Immigration Judge shall be accompanied by evidence
that the specified fee has been remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of   3.38(c) and
103.7 of this chapter. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal or motion filed under this subpart
by any person other than an officer of the Service relating to a matter involving an adjudication by an officer of the
Service shall be accompanied by the specified fee and remitted in accordance with the applicable provisions of  103.7
of this chapter. In any case in which an alien or other party affected is unable to pay the fee fixed for an appeal or a motion,
he or she shall file with the notice of appeal or the motion his or her affidavit or unsworn declaration, made pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 1746, stating the nature of the motion or appeal and his or her belief that he or she is entitled to redress.
Such document shall also establish his or her inability to pay the required fee, and shall request permission to prosecute
the appeal or motion without payment of such fee. When such a document is filed with the officer of the Service or the
Immigration Judge from whose decision the appeal is taken or with respect to whose decision the motion is addressed,
such Service Officer or Immigration Judge shall, if he or she believes that the appeal or motion is not taken or made
in good faith, certify in writing his or her reasons for such belief for consideration by the Board. The Board may, in
its discretion, authorize the prosecution of any appeal or motion without payment of the required fee.

12. Section 3.23 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 3.23 

Motions.



* * * * *



(b) 

Reopening/Reconsideration.

 (1) The Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion, or upon motion of the trail attorney or the alien, reopen or
reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction in the case is vested in the Board of Immigration
Appeals under part 3 of this chapter. Motions to reopen or reconsider a decision of the Immigration Judge must be filed
with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding. Such motions
shall comply with applicable provisions of 8 CFR 208.4, 208.19, and 242.22. The Immigration Judge may set and extend
time limits for replies to motions to reopen or reconsider. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless timely response
is made. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and shall be supported by pertinent authority.
Any motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application
for relief and all supporting documents. A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied
that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented
at the hearing; nor will any motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form
of discretionary relief be granted if the alien's rights to make such application were fully explained to him or her
by the Immigration Judge and he or she was afforded an opportunity to do so at the hearing, unless circumstances have
arisen thereafter on the basis of which the request is being made. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions
of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for
relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible
for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation.

(2) A motion to reconsider must be filed within 20 days after the date on which the decision for which reconsideration
is being sought was rendered, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. A party may
file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous
motion to reconsider.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must
be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding
sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later.

(4) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(3) shall not apply to a motion to reopen filed pursuant
to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5), or to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum or for withholding
of deportation based on changed circumstances, which arise subsequent to the commencement of proceedings, in the
country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, or to a motion to reopen agreed upon
by all parties and jointly filed.

(5) A motion to reopen deportation proceedings to rescind an order of deportation entered 

in absentia

 must be filed:

(i) Within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation. The motion must demonstrate that the failure to appear
was because of exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien (such as serious illness of the alien or death
of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances); or

(ii) At any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection 242B(a)(2)
of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(a)(2), and notice was required pursuant to such subsection; or the alien demonstrates that
the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.

(6) When requested in conjunction with a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge may stay
the execution of a final order of deportation or exclusion. The filing of a motion to reopen pursuant to the provisions
of paragraph (b)(5) shall stay the deportation of the alien pending decision on the motion and the adjudication of
any properly filed administrative appeal.

13. Section 3.38 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows:



 3.38 

Appeals.



* * * * *



(b) The Notice of Appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26)
shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding
within 10 calendar days after the Immigration Judge has rendered an oral decision on the record or within 10 calendar
days after a written decision has been served in person to the parties. Where the decision of the Immigration Judge
is served by mail, the Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR-26)
shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding
within 13 calendar days after the date the decision is mailed. If the final date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday,
or legal holiday, this appeal time shall be extended to the next business day. A notice of appeals may not be filed by
any party who has waived appeal.

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC-10-10, -15, -30, and -40 Series
Airplanes, KC-10A (Military) Airplanes, and Model MD-11 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-10 and MD-11 series airplanes. This proposal would require the installation of retainers
and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This proposal
is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket
could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-26-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.


Availability of NPRMs 


Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-26-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion 


A recent analysis conducted by the manufacturer revealed that the potential exists for uncommanded spoiler extension
due to failure, for any reason, of a lateral control mixer bracket on Model MD-11 series airplanes. The FAA has
reviewed the results of this analysis and has determined that failure of the lateral control mixer bracket could result
in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler on Model DC-10-10, -15, -30, and -40 series
airplanes, and KC-10A (military) airplanes, as well as on Model MD-11 series airplanes, since the brackets
are designed similarly on these airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent asymmetric
deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. 

The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Service Bulletin 27-222 [for Model DC-10-10,
-15, -30, and -40 series airplanes and KC-10 (military) airplanes], and MD-11 Service
Bulletin 27-34 (for Model MD-11 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993, that describe procedures
for installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar
of the airplane. This installation will minimize the possibility for uncommanded extension of the spoiler in the
event of a bracket failure or separation from the airplane structure. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket
on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with
the applicable service bulletin described previously.

There are approximately 427 Model DC-10-10, -15, -30, and -40 series airplanes and KC-10A
(military) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 241 airplanes of U.S. registry
would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the
proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $6,497
per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators of DC-10 series
airplanes is estimated to be $1,605,542 or $6,662 per airplane. 
There are approximately 114 Model MD-11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The
FAA estimates that 46 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $6,497 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators of Model MD-11 series airplanes is estimated to be $306,452, or $6,662 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>














Proposed Rule Changes of Self Regulatory Organizations; Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements
of National Securities Exchanges, Securities Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rulemaking.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing to amend Rule 19b-4 and Form 19b-4,
the rule and form that set forth the procedures for the filing by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') of proposed
rule changes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The amendments would expand the scope of those proposed rule
changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The proposed amendments are intended to expedite
and streamline the process through which proposed rule changes are filed and become effective. The Commission also
is proposing to amend the rules and forms applicable to the annual filing of amendments to registration statements
of national securities exchanges, securities associations, and reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, to streamline those requirements.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background on SRO Rule Filings 



A. Statutory Framework for Filing of Proposed Rule Changes 



Section 19(b)(1)

1

 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

2

 (``Exchange Act'' or ``Act'') requires a self-regulatory organization

3

 to file with the Commission its proposed rule changes

4

 accompanied by a concise general statement of the basis and purpose of the proposed rule change. Once a proposed rule
change has been filed, the Commission is required to publish notice of it and provide an opportunity for public comment.
The proposed rule change may not take effect unless it is approved by the Commission or is otherwise permitted to become
effective under Section 19(b) of the Act.

5

 









Section 19(b)(2) of the Act

6

 sets forth the standards and time periods for Commission action either to approve a proposed rule change or to institute
and conclude a proceeding to determine whether a proposed rule change should be disapproved. Generally, the Commission
must either approve the proposed rule change or institute disapproval proceedings within 35 days of the publication
of notice of the filing or within such longer period if the Commission finds appropriate or to which the SRO consents.
The Commission must approve a proposed rule change if it finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the SRO proposing the rule change. If the Commission
does not make that finding, it must institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.
The Commission also may approve a proposed rule change on an accelerated basis prior to 30 days after publication of
the notice if the Commission finds good cause for so doing and publishes its reasons for so finding.

7

 






Section 19(b)(3) of the Act

8

 provides that, in certain circumstances, a proposed rule change may become effective without the notice and approval
procedures required by Section 19(b)(2). Paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) permits certain types of proposed rule
changes to take effect in this manner if appropriately designated by the SRO as within the following categories: (1)
Constituting a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement
of an existing rule of the SRO;

9

 (2) establishing or changing a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the SRO;

10

 or (3) concerned solely with the administration of the SRO. Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) also gives the Commission the
authority to expand by rule the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A)
if the Commission determines that the expansion is consistent with the public interest and the purposes of Section
19(b). Rule 19b-4(e) implements the authority of Section 19(b)(3)(A) by detailing further the scope of proposed
rule changes that may be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). The rule tracks those categories enumerated in Section
19(b)(3)(A) mentioned above and also includes a category adopted in 1980 relating to registered clearing agencies.

B. The Market 2000 Report 



In its Market 2000 Report (``Report''), the Commission's Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') committed
to working with the SROs to streamline the review of proposed rule changes.

12

 The Division noted in the Report that SROs have argued that the process for the filing, review, and approval of proposed
rule changes is too lengthy and hampers the efforts of the SROs to provide prompt, flexible, and innovative order-entry
and trading services to their members and the investing public.

13

 The Division agreed that the rule review process should be expedited for routine procedural and administrative modifications
to existing order-entry and trading systems, but noted that modifications that would restrict access, burden competition,
or modify provisions or procedures designed for the protection of investors should continue to be considered after
the applicable notice and comment period under Section 19(b)(2).

14

 The Report also indicated that the Division would consider other types of proposed rule changes that could be subject
to an expedited review process. 







II. Expanding the Scope of Proposed Rule Changes Filed Under Section 19(b)(3)(A) 



A. Systems Changes 



Pursuant to authority in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, and consistent with recommendations made in the Market
2000 Report, the Commission proposes to amend Rule 19b-4 and the instructions to Form 19b-4 by expanding
the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under Section 19(b)(3)(A). In particular, routine procedural
and administrative modifications to existing order-entry and trading systems would become eligible for filing
under this provision. 

The Commission believes that proposed modifications to existing systems that are operational in nature are not likely
to raise the policy concerns that warrant the full notice and comment procedures of Section 19(b)(2).

15

 Accordingly, the Commission proposes to expand the category of rule filings that are eligible for filing under Section
19(b)(3)(A) to include systems changes that do not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public
interest, do not impose any significant burden on competition, and do not have the effect of limiting access to or availability
of the system. 





Under the amendment, a proposed rule change that, for example, would increase marginally the maximum number of shares
per order that could be executed through an SRO's small order routing and execution system may be eligible to become
effective upon filing.

16

 Another example would be a proposed rule change expanding the number of series or classes eligible for options routing
and execution systems. 





In contrast, a proposed rule change involving a systems change that would affect the surveillance or oversight capabilities
of the SRO or other appropriate regulatory authority would not be properly filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). Such
a rule change could directly impair the protection of investors and thus should be filed under Section 19(b)(2). Another
example of a proposed rule change that would not be eligible for filing under Section 19(b)(3)(A) is one that would
make mandatory the use of a particular order-entry or trading system by members. Because such a rule change could impose
burdens on competition, it should be filed for consideration under the more comprehensive procedures of Section
19(b)(2). Similarly, it would be inappropriate to permit a proposed rule change to become effective immediately
if it could have the effect of limiting the access to or availability of the system to members or investors.

B. Other Noncontroversial Rule Filings After Prior Notice to the Commission 



The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 19b-4 and the instructions to Form 19b-4, pursuant to authority
in Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act, to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective
under Section 19(b)(3)(A) to include certain noncontroversial filings, if the proposed rule change, by its terms,
does not become operative for 30 days after the date of publication of the notice of filing or such shorter time as the
Commission may designate.

17

 For these filings, SROs also would be required to provide written notice to the Commission five business days prior
to the filing.

18

 Filing this type of proposed rule change under Section 19(b)(3)(A) should allow SROs to implement these rule changes
more quickly than if they were filed under Section 19(b)(2). 






This new provision only would apply to those proposed rule changes that are properly designated by the SRO as not significantly
affecting the protection of investors and not imposing any significant burden on competition. For purposes of meeting
this requirement, the impact or burden of a proposed rule change would be significant if, in the view of the Commission
staff or industry participants, the change would require more than a cursory analysis to determine whether the impact
or burden was necessary or appropriate under the Exchange Act. Proposed rule changes meeting these criteria generally
are less likely to engender adverse comments or require the degree of review attendant with more controversial filings.


For example, a proposed rule change that adds an existing rule to an SRO's minor rule violation plan, that is objective
in nature, such as a reporting obligation, and that does not involve a violation of the federal securities laws or the
rules thereunder, could be properly filed under this provision. Another example would be a proposed rule change permitting
the transmission of data to or from the SRO by computer interface or other electronic means. A proposed rule change,
however, that would reduce public representation in the administration of the affairs of an SRO or that would amend
the procedures for arbitration or disciplinary proceedings would not be a proper candidate to become effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A). These types of filings implicate basic policy considerations with respect to the protection
of investors, and should be filed under Section 19(b)(2) to allow for more careful scrutiny. 

Under this new provision, the SRO would have to provide the Commission with written notice of its intent to file the
proposed rule change, along with a brief description and the text of the proposed rule change, at least five business
days prior to the filing date.

19

 The Commission expects that such notices will be brief and informal and often will be transmitted by facsimile. This
prior notice would give Commission staff an opportunity to discuss with the SRO whether there exists an adequate basis
upon which the proposed rule change may properly qualify under this provision. Furthermore, the notice could elicit
guidance from Commission staff to help the SRO identify those aspects of a proposed rule change that the Commission
deems important. This should help the SRO articulate in its subsequent filing the purpose and effects of the proposed
rule change, which in turn should further facilitate and expedite the filing process.

20

 





The requirement that a proposed rule change filed in this manner cannot, by its terms, become operative prior to 30
days after the date of publication of the notice of filing would provide a meaningful opportunity for public comment
prior to the rule's operation. This would allow the Commission, if necessary, to abrogate the rule change before it
became operative in the least disruptive manner possible, if the proposed rule change was determined to be inconsistent
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. This 30-day requirement, however,
could be shortened or waived by the Commission if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest.


The Commission notes that it presently has the authority under Section 19(b)(3)(C)

21

 of the Act to abrogate summarily within sixty days of filing any proposed rule change that becomes effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A). If the proposals to expand the scope of proposed rule changes that may become effective under
Section 19(b)(3)(A) are adopted, however, the Commission intends to revise its rules to delegate this abrogation
authority to the Director of the Division. This would be necessary to facilitate an expected increase in the volume
of proposed rule changes that would be filed under Section 19(b)(3)(A). 




C. Submission of Form 19b-4 on Paper and on Computer Diskette 



During the past five years, the staff of the Commission has acted on over 2,000 SRO rule filings. In addition to submitting
a proposed rule change on Form 19b-4, the SRO is responsible for preparing and attaching an exhibit to the form
containing the complete notice of the proposed rule change for publication in the 

Federal Register

. Staff of the Commission may amend or supplement this notice in preparing it for publication. If and when the proposed
rule change is approved, staff also prepares an approval order for similar publication. Thus significant staff resources
are devoted to processing these filings and preparing them for publication. 

The Commission therefore is encouraging SROs to submit certain portions of all filings on computer diskette in an
appropriate wordprocessing format. This only would apply to Form 19b-4 and the notice for publication (Exhibit
1 to Form 19b-4). The paper version of these documents would continue to be required, but the electronic version
would provide a more efficient way for Commission staff to review and prepare the initial notice for publication in
the 

Federal Register

. 



D. Miscellaneous Amendments to Form 19b-4 



The Commission also is proposing to reduce the number of copies of Form 19b-4 and Exhibit 1 that SROs must submit,
from twelve to eight, including the manually signed original. The Commission also is correcting miscellaneous outdated
references contained in Form 19b-4 with respect to the Commission's address and appropriate offices within
the Division to which filings of proposed rule changes should be directed.

III. Background on Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements of National Securities Exchanges, Securities
Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 



Section 5 of the Exchange Act

22

 generally prohibits securities transactions on a national securities exchange unless the exchange is registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 6 of the Act.

23

 Section 6 sets forth the conditions for exchange registration and requires that an exchange file an application for
registration under Rule 6a-1 under the Act.

24

 That rule requires an applicant for registration, or for exemption from registration, to file an application on Form
1,

25

 together with accompanying exhibits containing, among other things, the rules of the exchange, its financial statements,
and its various forms, schedules, and membership lists. 







Pursuant to Rule 6a-2, a registered or exempted exchange generally must update its registration annually by
filing amendments on Form 1-A to reflect any changes in specified information contained in the registration
statement of the exchange or its accompanying exhibits that were not previously reported in an amendment.

26

 The Commission adopted amendments in 1983 to permit exchanges to update exhibits containing the constitution, by-laws,
and rules of the exchange and its affiliates only once every three years.

27

 The Commission believes that it can streamline the requirement to file annual amendments for certain exhibits to
exchange registration. This information is either publicly available, becomes available to the Commission through
other means, or is not useful enough to justify the burden placed on the exchanges in collecting and filing it with the
Commission each year. The Commission notes that for certain of these exhibits, Exchange Act rules will continue to
require national securities exchanges to provide the Commission with prompt notification after any action that
renders those exhibits inaccurate.

28

 In addition, Rule 17a-1 will continue to require exchanges to maintain and preserve for prescribed periods
all documents and other records made or received by it in the course of its business and in the conduct of its self-regulatory
activity, and upon request of any representative of the Commission, to promptly furnish such documents.

29

 







For the same reasons, the Commission proposes to amend the analogous rules and forms applicable to national securities
associations (namely, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''))

30

 and the MSRB. The NASD has similar requirements to update and file certain information annually, although the form
used for this purpose differs significantly from that used for exchanges.

31

 For example, the registration and amendment forms used by the NASD are organized along the lines of rule categories,
whereas the format for exchanges focuses on exhibits and lists. The MSRB also has an annual reporting requirement.

32

 The Commission believes that it would be appropriate to streamline the reporting requirements for these SROs as well,
and to the extent the reports concern matters analagous to those applicable to exchanges, to conform them with the
requirements for exchanges.

IV. Description of Proposal To Amend Requirements for the Annual Filing of Amendments to Registration Statements
of National Securities Exchanges, Securities Associations, and Reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board 



As described above, Rule 6a-2 of the Exchange Act requires an exchange to update and file annually certain amendments
to its registration with the Commission. Exchanges submit these filings on Form 1-A by referencing the appropriate
exhibit to the exchange registration being amended. Because the Commission believes that this is unnecessary for
much of this information, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 6a-2 that would eliminate or reduce
this annual filing requirement for the following: Exhibit B (forms pertaining to application for membership and
approval as a person associated with a member); Exhibit C (forms of financial statements, reports, or questionnaires
relating to financial responsibility); Exhibit D (documents comprising listing applications including agreements
required in connection therewith, and a schedule of listing fees); Exhibit I (list of all individual members and related
information); Exhibit J (certain information related to a list of all member organizations of the exchange); and
Exhibit K (schedule of securities listed on the exchange). For all the remaining exhibits, with the exception of Exhibits
E and F, which concern financial statements,
 exchanges would have the option, in lieu of the annual filing, to publish or cooperate in the publication of this information
on an annual or more frequent basis, and to certify to the accuracy of the information. Exchanges would have the further
option of keeping the information in Exhibits A(1), A(2), A(3), L, and M up to date, and certifying that the information
is up to date and available to the Commission and the public upon request.
 In addition, the Commission is proposing to add the date of election to membership, if available, as an item to be filed
by exchanges annually under Exhibit J. This is necessary to enable the Commission to monitor the obligation of broker-dealers
to be a member of an SRO.
 It also will help the Commission to designate an appropriate examining authority for each broker-dealer.


 







The Commission also is proposing to make corresponding changes, where applicable, to the requirements for the NASD
and MSRB. Thus, the requirement to file certain information annually would be streamlined, and the reporting requirements
for the NASD and the MSRB would be conformed, where appropriate, to the requirements for the exchanges. In addition,
similar to the proposal for exchanges discussed above, for certain information, these SROs would have the option,
in lieu of an annual filing, of identifying the publication in which this information is available or keeping such
information up to date and making it available to the Commission and the public. The Commission is requesting specific
comment on these proposals. 



V. Conclusion and Request for Comments 



The Commission believes that the proposals described above, if adopted, would expedite and streamline the process
through which SROs file proposed rule changes with the Commission.
 The proposals also would streamline the requirements to file amendments to registration statements of national
securities exchanges, securities associations, and reports of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The
Commission requests comment on each of these proposals. The Commission requests specific comment on the amendments
to the annual filing requirements for securities exchanges, securities associations, and the MSRB, with a view toward
maintaining comparable requirements for all SROs. 





VI. Effects on Competition and Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations 



Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the impact on competition of those
rules, if any, and to balance that impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes
of the Exchange Act. The Commission preliminarily is of the view that adoption of the proposed amendments to Rule 19b-4,
Form 19b-4, and Rule 6a-2 would not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. The Commission requests comment, however, on any competitive burdens that might
result from adoption of these amendments. 





In addition, Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'')
 requires the Commission to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the proposed amendments on small
entities unless the Chairman certifies that the rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.
 Rule 19b-4 and Form 19b-4 apply only to SROs. Rule 6a-2 applies only to national securities exchanges.
Furthermore, the proposed amendments are intended to streamline a process to which these SROs already are subject.
The Chairman has certified that the proposed amendments, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rules. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing a new rule and proposing to amend its rules
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to reduce existing regulatory distinctions between debt securities listed
on a national securities exchange and those traded in the over-the-counter market. The Commission also is proposing
to simplify registration procedures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for listed debt securities. The proposals
would: exempt listed debt securities from restrictions on borrowing and the proxy rules; provide for the automatic
effectiveness of a Form 8-A registration statement for listed debt securities; and eliminate the filing fee
associated with the Form 8-A registration statement for listed debt. Comment also is being requested as to whether
it is advisable to extend reporting requirements to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the over-the-counter
market under certain circumstances where the issuer is not otherwise subject to periodic reporting requirements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''),
 the Commission is publishing for comment proposed new Rule 3a12-11 and revisions to Rules 12b-7,
 12d1-2,
 and Form 8-A.
 The proposed rule and amendments are intended to provide regulatory relief to issuers listing debt securities on
a national securities exchange.

I. Discussion of Proposals


A. Introduction and Summary 


Section 12 of the Exchange Act
 requires all securities listed on a national securities exchange to be registered under the Exchange Act.
 Registration subjects the securities, whether debt or equity, to a number of regulatory provisions, including restrictions
on borrowing,
 periodic reporting by the issuer,
 and proxy regulation.
 In contrast, debt securities traded in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') market are not required to be registered under
the Exchange Act,
 and, therefore, such securities are not subject to the restrictions on borrowing or proxy regulation. These regulatory
distinctions may have unnecessarily and unintentionally affected the structure and development of the debt markets.










The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') has advised the Commission that the additional regulatory requirements imposed
on listed debt securities create significant disincentives for issuers to list their debt on the national securities
exchanges and urged that exemptive action be taken to eliminate this disparity. To address this disparate regulatory
treatment between listed and OTC-traded debt, the Commission is proposing to exempt listed debt securities from
the borrowing restrictions and proxy rules under the Exchange Act. Listed debt securities, however, would remain
subject to the registration and reporting requirements. The Commission also is proposing to simplify the registration
process by providing for the immediate effectiveness of Form 8-A registration statements pertaining to the
listing of debt securities on a national securities exchange and eliminating the filing fee associated with the form.

In addition to these proposals to ease the regulatory obligations resulting from listing debt securities, the Commission
also is considering whether additional informational requirements should be imposed on issuers of OTC-traded debt
securities. Accordingly, as discussed below, the Commission is requesting comment on the benefits of periodic reporting
requirements with respect to issuers of debt securities and on whether it is advisable to extend those requirements
to issuers of debt securities that are traded in the OTC market, comparable to the requirements applicable to issuers
that list their debt securities on a national securities exchange. 


B. Exemption From the Borrowing Restrictions of the Exchange Act 


In the aftermath of the 1929 market crash, Congress enacted the Exchange Act to regulate, among other matters, the
extension of credit in the securities markets.
 Along with margin provisions,
 Congress placed a restriction on the ability of broker-dealers to borrow, in the ordinary course of business, using
exchange-traded securities as collateral. Under Section 8(a) of the Exchange Act,
 a broker-dealer can pledge a listed security, other than an exempted security, only to certain lenders: a member bank
of the Federal Reserve System; a non-member bank that has filed with the Federal Reserve Board an agreement to comply
with those provisions of the federal securities and banking laws that apply to member banks; or another broker-dealer
if such a loan is permissible under the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.
 As noted above, Section 8(a) specifically excludes exempted securities from these restrictions on borrowing. Under
Section 3(a)(12) of the Exchange Act,
 the term ``exempted securities'' includes such securities as the Commission may exempt from the operation of any
one or more provisions of the Exchange Act. 








In 1968, when Congress extended many of the margin provisions (i.e., Section 7(a)) to securities traded exclusively
in the OTC market,
 Congress placed no comparable restriction on the ability of broker-dealers to borrow against OTC securities.
 As a result, a broker-dealer can use bonds that are not listed on an exchange to secure financing from any lender, whether
or not that lender falls within the statutorily enumerated categories. 





Since that time, various market participants have voiced concerns that Section 8(a) is overly restrictive and competitively
unfair.
 According to these participants, broker-dealers' discretion in financing their positions is unduly constrained
once a debt security is traded on an exchange. In addition, at least one national securities exchange has been informed
by its members that the members may advise an issuer against listing bonds due to the restrictions in Section 8(a).
 





Given the developments in the OTC market since Congress took action in the 1960s, the current structure of the bond
market and the nature of debt financing, the differential treatment of exchange-listed and OTC-traded debt securities
does not appear to be warranted. In today's highly competitive market environment, the current regulatory scheme
may detract unfairly from broker dealers' ability to finance their positions, and from the national securities exchanges'
ability to obtain debt listings.

The Commission is proposing to exempt
 exchange-traded debt securities from the borrowing restrictions of Section 8(a).
 The proposed exemption to the restrictions on borrowing would eliminate one competitive barrier to the exchange
trading of debt securities. Specifically, to the extent that the restrictions of Section 8(a) may encourage underwriters
and investment bankers to recommend against debt securities being listed, the proposed exemption would eliminate
that impediment to the listing of debt securities on a national securities exchange. 





Moreover, the exemption from the restrictions on borrowing could provide certain benefits to the financial system.
Under this proposal, a broker-dealer borrowing against a listed debt security could choose among prospective lenders
based solely upon the terms of the financing that they offer. For instance, the exemption would make it possible for
a broker-dealer to enter into a repurchase agreement with a non-bank institutional investor. This flexibility should
help broker-dealers obtain financing at the lowest available cost. 
For purposes of the proposed rule, the term ``debt security'' would include any security that is not an ``equity security''
as defined by the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.
 Comment is solicited as to whether, in lieu of the proposed definition, the term ``debt security'' should be more specifically
defined. For example, should the term ``debt security'' be defined as: ``(1) A note, bond, debenture or evidence of
indebtedness; (2) a certificate of interest or participation in any such note, bond, debenture or evidence of indebtedness;
or (3) a temporary certificate for, or guarantee of, any such note, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness or certificate;
but shall not include an `equity security' as defined in Section 3(a)(11) of the Act and Rule 3a11-1 thereunder''?
 Comment also is solicited as to whether hybrid debt securities should be treated as debt securities for purposes of
Rule 3a12-11. 





The Commission requests commenters to address the scope of the proposed exemption as well as its merits. Are there
any categories of listed debt securities that should remain subject to the borrowing restrictions? Interested persons
may also wish to comment on how exempting exchange-traded debt securities from Section 8(a) restrictions would affect
investor protection in the debt market, including whether the purposes behind the Exchange Act's credit provisions
would be frustrated as a result. Interested persons may also wish to comment on the proposed rule's impact on the transparency
and liquidity of the market for debt securities. 


C. Exemption From Compliance With the Proxy Rules 


A second provision of the proposed rule would exempt debt securities listed on a national securities exchange from
proxy regulation.
 By proposing to exempt debt listed on a national securities exchange from the proxy rules, the Commission seeks to
address the disparate application of the proxy rules between listed debt securities and debt securities traded in
the OTC market. The proxy rules principally apply to equity securities, since most debt securities are not listed
on a national securities exchange and thus not subject to the proxy rules.
 





In 1963, the Commission submitted a report to Congress that set forth its recommendations as to the scope of regulation
needed for the OTC market.
 These recommendations led to the adoption of Section 12(g) in 1964. The Commission concluded that proxy regulation
should not be required with respect to debt securities since Section 14 was designed to protect shareholders and the
solicitation of proxies was ``rarely [a] problem[ ] related to debt securities and, then, most probably in insolvency
cases when other protections were available.''
 Today, solicitations of debtholders subject to the proxy rules continue to be infrequent, with only 18 such solicitations
having occurred between 1990 and 1993 with respect to NYSE-listed issuers.

<DOCNO> FR940607-1-00022 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940607-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the context of listed debt, the proxy rules, for the most part, cover solicitations to modify the terms of a trust
indenture. Given the strictures already imposed by the indenture contract, as well as the Trust Indenture Act, comment
is solicited as to whether the benefits to debtholders from the application of the proxy rules to debt securities listed
on a national securities exchange outweigh the costs to the issuers in complying with the proxy rules in connection
with proxy or consent solicitations.

30

 If the proxy rules provide important protections with respect to publicly-traded debt securities that should be
preserved, does the need for these protections derive from the listing of the security on a national securities exchange
or rather because it is traded in the public debt markets? If the latter is the case, should the Commission seek to extend
the proxy rules to all publicly-traded debt securities, similar to the treatment of equity securities under Section
12(g) of the Exchange Act? Comment also is solicited as to whether an issuer's solicitation of holders of debt securities
listed on a national securities exchange should remain subject to the antifraud proscriptions of Rule 14a-9

31

 and/or the rules adopted under Section 14 of the Exchange Act to facilitate the transmission of proxy and consent materials
to beneficial owners,

32

 even if exempted from other proxy regulation. Finally, is the application of the proxy rules currently part of the
expectations of the parties negotiating an indenture agreement, or of investors purchasing a listed debt security?
If so, should the proposed exemption be prospective in nature and thus inapplicable to classes of debt listed before
the effective date of the exemption? 







D. Automatic Effectiveness of Form 8-A and Elimination of Filing Fee 



The Commission proposes to reduce or eliminate some of the procedural costs of listing debt on a national securities
exchange, both through rulemaking and through practical modifications to filing procedures.

33

 Currently, Form 8-A registration statements must be declared effective by the staff, pursuant to delegated
authority, which necessitates coordination among the issuer, its counsel, the Commission staff, and the national
securities exchange. A rule change is proposed to provide for the automatic effectiveness of registration statements
on Form 8-A, including amendments, that pertain only to the listing of debt securities on a national securities
exchange.

34

 In the case where debt securities of the class being registered were concurrently being registered under the Securities
Act, the Form 8-A would become effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of the related Securities Act
registration statement if certification by the national securities exchange had been received by the Commission
on or before the effectiveness of the related Securities Act registration statement. If, however, that class of debt
securities was not concurrently being registered under the Securities Act, then the Form 8-A would become effective
upon filing if certification by the exchange had been received by the Commission on or before the filing of the form.

<TEXT>
 

In addition, the Commission proposes to eliminate the $250 filing fee for registering a class of debt securities on
Form 8-A.

36

 Form 8-A would be revised to add two new boxes, one of which the issuer would check to signify it is a debt registration
requiring no fee and that the Form 8-A: (1) Is to be effective automatically upon filing, as no debt securities
of the class being registered on the form are being registered concurrently under the Securities Act; or (2) is to be
effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of a related Securities Act registration statement. Comment is
solicited as to whether these proposed amendments address the procedural and timing concerns of issuers listing
debt securities on a national securities exchange.

Today's proposals do not exempt listed debt securities from registration and reporting under the Exchange Act. Companies
that list their debt securities for trading in the public market will still have to provide annual, quarterly, and
current reports. This raises the question as to the need for similar requirements for issuers with substantial amounts
of debt securities traded in the OTC market. 

When Congress amended the Exchange Act in 1964 to add Section 12(g), it extended registration to the OTC market for
the first time. However, the 1964 amendments focused exclusively on issuers of equity securities. No comparable
provision was provided for debt securities that are traded in the OTC market. This difference in regulatory treatment
was not based on a policy decision that current financial information is not important to the market. Rather, the decision
appears to have been based, at least in part, on the nature of the debt securities market in 1963. At that time, it was
considered unnecessary to extend registration to debt securities trading in the OTC market, as it appeared that a
company that had a significant amount of debt securities outstanding would probably meet the Section 12(g) threshold
with respect to its equity securities.

37

 





Specifically, in its 1963 Special Study, the Commission cited the results of a questionnaire it used in, among other
matters, determining whether debtholders independently needed the protections of Section 13, 14, and 16 of the Exchange
Act.

38

 The questionnaire sought information about outstanding debt securities, face dollar amount, and number of holders.
While acknowledging the small number of respondents to the questionnaire, the Commission found that of 218 issuers
that responded, only 58 would not have incurred a reporting obligation.

39

 Of these issuers, 45% had less than $250,000 face amount of debt securities outstanding, 60% less than $500,000 outstanding,
and 76% less than $1,000,000.

40

 The Commission concluded that the proposed Section 12(g) equity threshold would make financial reports publicly
available to a large majority of debtholders. Furthermore, the aggregate sums lent by issuers that would not be subject
to any reporting obligation tended to be modest. Thus, the 1963 Special Study recommended to Congress that Section
12(g) not apply to debt securities.

41

 








In the 1980s, the issuance of debt securities in both private placements and public offerings began to increase dramatically.

42

 In addition, the increasing use of leveraged buyouts that concentrated equity ownership below Section 12(g) thresholds
resulted in a number of companies with significant outstanding debt securities that are not reporting companies.
Concerns have been expressed about the lack of information being available to the market regarding the issuers of
some of these securities.

43

 In the case of privately placed debt securities traded in the OTC market, no registration or periodic reporting under
the Exchange Act is required. Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act

44

 requires reporting by issuers that make a registered offering of equity or debt securities, but permits companies
to suspend their reporting obligations after one year when a class of securities are held by fewer than 300 record holders.








As applied, most issuances of debt securities are viewed as separate classes of debt. Therefore, it is not uncommon
for a company that sells registered debt securities not to have a 15(d) reporting obligation after its first year.
While there may be more than 300 holders of record for all the registered debt of a company, it is not uncommon that there
are fewer than 300 holders of record for any one issue. 

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance recently examined information on companies that had more than 5 million
dollars of debt securities outstanding to determine whether the companies were reporting with the Commission. The
staff concluded that there are at least 200 non-reporting issuers, with over $47 billion of debt securities outstanding.

45

 It appears appropriate to determine whether the nature and size of the debt market has sufficiently changed since
the 1960s such that continuous reporting by issuers with significant amount of debt securities may now be warranted.

<PARENT> FR940607-1-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Comment is solicited as to whether it is now desirable for the Commission to adopt rules or exercise definitional authority
under the Exchange Act or Trust Indenture Act to increase the number of issuers with debt securities traded in the OTC
market that would be subject to periodic reporting. For example, are periodic reports needed for companies that have
issued debt securities but subsequently suspended their reporting obligations pursuant to Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act? Comment also is solicited as to whether, even in the absence of a registered offering, an issuer of debt
securities should be subject to an Exchange Act reporting obligation, similar to the provisions governing the registration
of equity under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. 

If such reporting obligations are needed, should the thresholds be based upon the total dollar amount of debt securities
outstanding, the number of record or beneficial holders, and/or other criteria? If the number of holders, comment
is solicited as to the appropriate threshold number of holders (i.e., 300, 500, or some greater or lesser number)?
Comment is solicited as to how the number of holders should be calculated for these purposes.

46

 Comment also is solicited as to whether the total amount of registered debt securities outstanding of an issuer should
be viewed as one class in determining whether the threshold is met. 





II. Request for Comment
 


Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the proposed rules and amendments, as well as any other
matters that might have an impact on the proposals set forth in the release are requested to do so. Comments are requested
on the impact of the proposals on issuers, debtholders, broker-dealers, and others. The Commission also requests
comment on whether the proposals, if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competition that is neither necessary
nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. Comments will be considered by the Commission in complying
with its responsibilities under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

47

 





III. Cost-Benefit Analysis
 


To assist the Commission in its evaluation of the costs and benefits that may result from the proposals, commenters
are requested to provide views and data relating to any costs and benefits associated with these proposals. The proposals
are expected to decrease the net costs to issuers associated with listing debt securities on a national securities
exchange, without materially diminishing the benefits to investors. Among other matters, the proposals would exempt
the class of debt securities from the restrictions on borrowing and the proxy rules. 

The costs to investors associated with these proposed rules and revisions are minimal. Currently, an issuer is not
required to register debt securities under the Exchange Act in order for those securities to be traded in the OTC market.
By reducing the regulatory costs of listing debt on a national securities exchange, it is expected that more issuers
will list such securities and thus register under the Exchange Act. 



IV. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
 


An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 for the proposed rule
and amendments to Rule 12b-7, 12d1-2, and Form 8-A. The analysis notes that the proposals are expected
to reduce regulatory costs for small entities. 

As discussed more fully in the analysis, the proposed changes would affect persons that are small entities, as defined
by the Commission's rules. The exemptions provided by Rule 3a12-11 and revisions to Rules 12b-7, 12d1-2,
and Form 8-A are expected to decrease the compliance burdens of small entities. 

Commenters are encouraged to comment on any aspect of the analysis. Such comments will be considered in the preparation
of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if the proposed rule and amendments are adopted. A copy of the analysis
may be obtained by contacting Joseph P. Babits, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.

Special Local Regulations for Marine Events; Atlantic Ocean, Ocean City, MD



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The Coast Guard is proposing to establish permanent special local regulations for the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix
held annually in the Atlantic Ocean off Ocean City. The effect of these regulations will be to restrict general navigation
in the regulated area for the safety of spectators and participants. These regulations are needed to provide for the
safety of life, limb, and property on the navigable waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments



Interested persons are invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written views, data, or arguments.
Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this notice (CGD 05-94-017)
and the specific section of the proposal to which their comments apply. Reasons should be given for each comment. The
regulations may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received before the expiration of the comment
period will be considered before final action is taken. No public hearing is planned, but one may be held if written
requests for a hearing are received and it is determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aid the
rulemaking process. The receipt of comments will be acknowledged if a stamped self-addressed postcard or envelope
is enclosed.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this notice are QM2 Gregory C. Garrison, project officer, Boating Affairs Branch, Fifth Coast Guard
District, and LT Monica L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.



Discussion of Proposed Regulations



The United States Offshore Racing Association annually sponsors the Ocean City Offshore Grand Prix. Each year the
United States Offshore Racing Association requests that the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial
traffic within the regulated area, as part of their application. Since this is a regular, yearly event, the Coast Guard
proposes to develop a special local regulation. Specifically the Coast Guard seeks to regulate the waterways surrounding
the race course. The course runs from Ocean City Inlet to Maryland Beach. To provide for the safety of participants,
spectators, and vessels transiting the area, the Coast Guard will restrict vessel movement in the regulated area.
A temporary spectator anchorage area will be established for what is expected to be a large spectator fleet. Coast
Guard patrol vessels will be positioned at Ocean City Inlet to direct vessels around the regulated area, or to the temporary
spectator anchorage area. The sponsor usually provides 29 vessels to assist the Coast Guard and local government
agencies in patrolling the event. Medical vessels will display flourescent orange placards, and patrol boats will
display flourescent green placards.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This regulation will only be in effect for several hours, one day a year, and the
impact on routine navigation is expected to be minimal.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small Entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). It is anticipated that the impact of this proposal on non-participating small entities will actually
benefit their business due to the increase in local tourism. The Coast Guard will certify under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.




Collection of Information



This proposed rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).

Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it is anticipated that this proposed rulemaking will not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment Assessment



This proposed rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded
from further environmental documentation in accordance with  2.B.2.c of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket, and is available

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to limit the number of openings of the East Sunrise Boulevard Drawbridge, mile 1062.6 at Fort
Lauderdale during certain periods. This proposal is being made to relieve highway congestion created by back-to-back
bridge openings while still meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments




The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking [CGD07-93-026]
and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. The Coast
Guard requests that all comments and attachments be submitted in an unbound format suitable for copying. If not practical,
a second copy of any bound material is requested. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose
a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to Mr. Brodie Rich at the address
under ``ADDRESSES

''. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for
oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced
by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.



Drafing Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Brodie Rich, Project Manager and LT J. M. Losego, Project
Counsel.



Background and Purpose



This new drawbridge presently opens on signal. Congressman E. Clay Shaw, Jr. requested that the Coast Guard conduct
a study to determine whether scheduled openings would improve traffic conditions in the area. The bridge owner (Florida
Department of Transportation) recommended hour and half-hour openings on weekdays and 20-minute openings on weekends
during the season to reduce traffic delays. A Coast Guard evaluation of the proposal concluded that the very light
highway traffic levels for this six-laned roadway and the frequency of bridge openings did not justify the proposed
opening schedules. However, in order to eliminate back-to-back openings during the tourist season which create
traffic congestion, a 15-minute opening schedule appears to be warranted.



Discussion of Proposed Amendments



The Coast Guard tested a 15-minute opening schedule between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily from December 1, 1993 through January
30, 1994, pursuant to a published Notice of Deviation (58 FR 65668; December 16, 1993). No comments were received in
response to the Notice of Deviation. The results of the test indicated traffic backups created by back-to-back openings
were reduced. The proposed rule would allow for a 15-minute opening schedule to cover the period from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
daily during the season (November 15th through May 15th).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940607-1-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940607-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This schedule should eliminate back-to-back openings and help to reduce traffic delays without unreasonably impacting
navigation.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979) is unnecessary. We conclude this because the rule exempts tugs
with tows.



Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).

Since tugs with tows are exempt from this proposal, the economic impact is expected to be so minimal, the Coast Guard
certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that, under section 2.b.2.g(5)
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is
categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

Notice of proposed rule making.








</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to change regulations governing the operation of the Hillsboro Boulevard (SR 810) drawbridge,
mile 1050.0 at Deerfield Beach, Florida, by permitting the draw to remain closed for a longer period of time during
the winter season. This proposal is being made to relieve highway congestion created by bridge openings while still
meeting the reasonable needs of navigation.

Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Brodie Rich, Project Manager, and LT. J. M. Losego, Project
Counsel.



Background and Purpose



This drawbridge presently opens on signal, except that from October 1 through May 31, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., the draw
opens only on the hour, quarter-hour, half-hour and three-quarter hour. Mayor Sussman requested that the Coast Guard
change the operating regulations to provide for hour and half-hour drawbridge openings. The bridge owner (Florida
Department of Transportation) recommended a change to a 20-minute opening schedule during the season to reduce traffic
delays.
