<DOCTITLE>Certain Electrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod From Venezuela; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative
Review </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of preliminary results of countervailing duty administrative review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce is conducting an administrative review of the countervailing duty order on certain electrical
conductor aluminum redraw rod from Venezuela for the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. There are no
known entries in the review period. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that the cash deposit rate of estimated
countervailing duties will be 0.50 percent 

ad valorem,

 the rate established in the final results of the last administrative review of this order (57 FR 36063; August 12, 1992).
We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



On August 3, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative
Review'' (58 FR 41239) for the countervailing duty order on certain electrical conductor aluminum redraw rod from
Venezuela (53 FR 31904; August 22, 1988). We received a request for review from Southwire Company, the petitioner.
We initiated the review, covering the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992, on September 30, 1993 (58 FR
51053). The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act). The final results of the last administrative review of this order were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 14, 1992 (57 FR 41918). 



Scope of Review 



Imports covered by this review are shipments of certain electrical conductor aluminum redraw rod from Venezuela,
which is wrought rod of aluminum that is electrically conductive and contains not less than 99 percent of aluminum
by weight. This merchandise is currently classifiable under item numbers 7604.10.3010, 7604.10.3050, 7604.29.3010,
7604.29.3050, 7605.11.0030, 7605.11.0090, 7605.19.0000, 7605.21.0030, 7605.21.0090 and 7605.29.0000 of the


Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS). The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.
The review period is January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. 

In its questionnaire response, the Government of Venezuela reported no shipments of the subject merchandise to the
United States during the review period. On April 7, 1994, Southwire Company submitted factual information regarding
possible shipments of subject merchandise during the review period. We subsequently confirmed through various
Customs, Census, and Import Administration sources that there were no known entries of the subject merchandise during
the review period. See Memorandum to the File dated May 19, 1994; Certain Electrical Conductor Aluminum Redraw Rod
from Venezuela No Shipment Search, which is on file in the Central Records Unit (room B099 of the Main Commerce Building).




Preliminary Results of Review 



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that there are no known entries of the subject merchandise exported
to the United States in the period January 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992. Therefore, we preliminarily determine
the estimated net subsidy to be 0.50 percent 

ad valorem,

 the cash deposit rate established in the final results of the last administrative review (57 FR 36063; August 12, 1992).


If the final results of this review remain the same as these preliminary results, as provided by section 751(a)(1)
of the Act, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing
duties of 0.50 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of the subject merchandise from Venezuela entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final results of this review.


Interested parties may request a hearing, not later than 10 days after the date of publication of this notice. Interested
parties may submit written arguments in case briefs on these preliminary results within 30 days of the date of publication
in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(c). Rebuttal briefs, limited to arguments raised in case briefs, may be submitted
seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief. Any hearing, if requested, will be held seven days after the
scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be served on interested
parties in accordance with 19 CFR 355.38(e). 

Representatives of parties to the proceeding may request disclosure of proprietary information under administrative
protective order no later than 10 days after the representative's client or employer becomes a party to the proceeding,
but in no event later than the date the case briefs are due. 

The Department will publish the final results of this administrative review including the results of its analysis
of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 355.22.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 173-1,



June 10, 1994.



Announcing the Standard for Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS).

Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.



1. Name of Standard.

 Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) (FIPS PUB 173-1).



2. Category of Standard. 

Software Standard, Information Interchange.



3. Explanation.

 This standard provides specifications for the organization and structure of digital spatial data transfer, definition
of spatial features and attributes, data transfer encoding, and topological vector profile. The purpose of the standard
is to promote and facilitate the transfer of digital spatial data between dissimilar computer systems.

Work on a national spatial data transfer standard was initiated by the National Committee for Digital Cartographic
Data Standards, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping in 1982 to develop a comprehensive set of data exchange
standards for the profession. In 1985, the Standards Working Group of the Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee
on Digital Cartography also began work on spatial data exchange standards. During 1987, the results of these parallel
efforts were merged by the Digital Cartographic Data Standards Task Force into the proposed Digital Cartographic
Data Standard, published as a special issue of 

The American Cartographer 

in January 1988.

Subsequent testing, modification, and refining of the specifications were done by the Spatial Data Transfer Standard
Technical Review Board. These efforts resulted in the approval and issuance of the Spatial Data Transfer Standard
(SDTS) as Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 173 consisting of three parts: Part 1_Logical
Specifications, Part 2_Spatial Features, Part 3_ISO 8211 Encoding. The revision of this standard adds Part 4, the
Topological Vector Profile (TVP). The TVP is a limited subset of SDTS specifications for the transfer of vector data,
it also specifies several changes and clarifications to Parts 1 and 3 of SDTS. They are as follows:

a. many-to-many and many-to-one relationships between spatial objects and attributes are permitted (Section 5.3);

b. composite objects which do not contain component objects are permitted (Section 5.4);

c. the Entity Authority and Attribute Authority subfields in the Data Dictionary/Schema module may contain a maximum
of 8 characters; if Part 2 of the SDTS is the source of a definition the subfield shall contain ``SDTS-USA''; a provision
for standard feature registers of other countries has been added (Section 5.12);

d. the Attribute Authority subfield in the Data Dictionary/Domain and Data Dictionary/Definition modules may have
a maximum length of 8 characters (Sections 5.13 and 5.14);

e. the External Spatial Reference subfield in the Conformance field in the Identification module shall have a null
value meaning ``undefined, not relevant'' when used in a transfer containing only a master data dictionary; it is
acceptable to specify this by omitting this subfield (Section A.2.2);

f. in the Point-Node module, the Attribute ID field is not mandatory for objects ``NE'' and ``NL'' (Section 5.5.4);

g. in the Line module, Annex D allows the simultaneous use of both the Chain Component ID and Spatial Address subfields
(Section D.6.2); and

h. the ISO 8211 tag for the primary Field of the Arc module shall be ARCC (Section D.7.2).

SDTS supports the transfer of vector data with geometry and topology, raster data, graphic representation modules,
and geometry-only vector data. The SDTS Topological Vector Profile supports only geographic vector data with geometry
and topology.

An SDTS application profile, not requiring the full functionality of SDTS, defines requirements for a specific type
of data and/or application. A SDTS profile simplifies the implementation of SDTS while maximizing the probability
of successful data interchanges between dissimilar computer systems.



4. Approving Authority. 

Secretary of Commerce.



5. Maintenance Agency. 

U.S. Department of Interior, United States Geological Survey (USGS), National Mapping Division.



6. Related Documents.

 a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002,

b. A list of references is contained in section 1.3 and Annex F of Part 1 of the specifications.



7. Objectives. 

The objectives of the SDTS are to:




_provide a common mechanism for transferring digital spatial information between dissimilar computer systems,
while preserving information meaning, and minimizing the need for information external to this standard;

_provide, for the purpose of transfer, a set of clearly specified spatial objects and relationships to represent
real world spatial entities, and to specify the ancillary information necessary to accomplish the transfer;

_provide a transfer model that will facilitate the conversion of user-defined to standardized set of objects, relationships,
and information.






8. Applicability. 

a. This standard is intended for use in the acquisition and development of government applications and programs involving
the transfer of digital spatial data between dissimilar computer systems.

b. The use of the FIPS SDTS applies when the transfer of digital spatial data occurs or is likely to occur within and/or
outside of the Federal government.

c. The use of the FIPS SDTS does not apply to the transfer of digital spatial data files which are not intended to represent
spatial entities as digital geographic or cartographic features.

d. FIPS SDTS is not intended to facilitate product distribution of spatial data in a form designed for direct access
by application software specific to a particular data structure, class of computer platform, or distribution media.

e. Nonstandard features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot be reasonably implemented
with standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can be very useful, it should be recognized that the
use of these or any other nonstandard elements may make the interchange of digital spatial data and future conversions
more difficult and costly.

f. Use of this standard or a FIPS approved SDTS application profile, such as the SDTS TVP, is required for Federal Government
implementations of this standard. FIPS SDTS implementations not requiring full functionality are designated as
application profiles. Application profiles, requiring all three parts of the FIPS SDTS, are limited subsets designed
for use with a specific type of data and/or application. The SDTS Topological Vector Profile (TVP) is an application
profile.



9. Specifications. 

The FIPS SDTS, in four parts, provides specifications for the organization and structure of digital spatial data
transfer, definition of spatial features and attributes, data transfer encoding, and Topological Vector Profile.

Specifications of this FIPS have the following characteristics:

a. ability to transfer vector, raster, grid and attribute data and other ancillary information;

b. common set of terminology and definitions for spatial features;

c. internal description of the data types, formats, and data structures such that the information items can be readily
identified and processed in the recipient system; and

d. media independence and extendibility to encompass new spatial information as needed.



10. Implementation. 

The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of FIPS SDTS implementations,
validation, and interpretations of the standard.



10.1 Acquisition of FIPS SDTS Implementations. 

This revised standard becomes effective December 30, 1994.



10.2 Validation. 

Conformance to FIPS SDTS is applicable whether implementations are developed internally, acquired as part of an
automated data processing (ADP) procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement,
or specified for use in contracts for programming services.

Conformance criteria, based on application profiles, will be developed for use in validating the conformance of
FIPS SDTS implementations. Validation of implementations for conformance to FIPS SDTS conformance criteria, policy,
and procedures are under the authority of the FIPS program.



10.3 Interpretation of FIPS SDTS. 

Resolution of questions regarding this standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the content and specification
should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: FIPS SDTS Interpretation, National Institute
of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975-3271.

11. Waivers.

 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or

b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the 

Commerce Business Daily

 as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that
notice is published, by amendment of such notice.

A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552(b), shall be
part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.



12. Where to Obtain Copies.

military resale commodities and a service to be furnished by 
nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other 
severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On April 15, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 18104) of 
proposed additions to the Procurement List. 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
military resale commodities and service, fair market price, and 
impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, 
the Committee has determined that the military resale commodities 
and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the 
Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
military resale commodities and service to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the military resale commodities and 
service. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the military resale commodities and service to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the military resale 
commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement 
List. 
Accordingly, the following military resale commodities and 
service are hereby added to the Procurement List:

<DOCTITLE>Procurement List; Additions</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Additions to the procurement list.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List shipping boxes 
to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are 
blind or have other severe disabilities. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On March 11, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are 
Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 FR 11579) of 
proposed addition to the Procurement List. 


Comments were received from the current contractor for the boxes in 
response to a request for sales data. The contractor indicated 
that addition of the boxes to the Procurement List would cause one 
or more of four events to occur: Loss of sales for the contractor, 
loss of jobs, loss of profit for the contractor because of an 
inability to purchase raw materials in volume, and increased cost 
to the Government on future procurements conducted under the 
Committee's program. 
The contractor did not furnish any information to support its 
claims about loss of profit and increased cost to the Government. 
Nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program are 
required to sell to the Government at a fair market price set by 
the Committee, so there is little possibility of a substantial 
increase in price to the Government when an item is added to the 
Procurement List. 

The contract value for the boxes is such that loss of sales will 
represent only a very small percentage of the contractor's sales. 
The Committee does not believe that a sales loss of this size 
constitutes severe adverse impact on the contractor. 

The contractor provided a range of numbers of jobs which might be 
lost if the boxes are added to the Procurement List and did not 
indicate specifically whether any jobs would be lost because of the 
Committee's action. However, addition of the boxes to the 
Procurement List will definitely create jobs for blind people, who 
traditionally have unemployment rates far above those of people 
without severe disabilities. Consequently, the Committee believes 
that this definite creation of jobs for blind people outweighs the 
possible loss of jobs by the contractor's employees. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodities, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the commodities listed below are suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
commodities to the Government. 
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodities. 
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodities to the Government. 
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46 - 48c) in connection with the commodities proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List. 
Accordingly, the following commodities are hereby added to the 
Procurement List:



Box, Shipping 


8115-00-134-3655 
8115-00-134-3656 
8115-01-006-7257 
8115-01-010-8956 
8115-00-516-0251 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) to the American Statistical Association (ASA),
Alexandria, Virginia, under Grant Number DE-FG01-94EH89458. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive
financial assistance award. The purpose of the proposed grant is to support a conference entitled, ``Eleventh Conference
on Radiation and Health.'' This effort will have a total estimated cost of $92,000, which is currently allocated as
follows: $0 (0.0%) from the ASA, $50,000 (54.4%) from the DOE, $20,000 (21.7%) from other Federal agencies, and $22,000
(23.9%) from non-Federal sources.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed grant will provide funding to the ASA to organize and conduct its ``Eleventh Conference on Radiation
and Health.'' The theme of the conference is ``Radiation Dosimetry and Risk Assessment.'' The conference is scheduled
to be held from June 26 through July 1, 1994, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. The conference is planned to be a forum for
direct and efficient information transfer, both within the United States and internationally, among biostatisticians,
health physicists, epidemiologists, public health researchers, the general public, and to governmental entities.
The project will allow internationally recognized researchers to review and consider methods and information about
radiation and health in a multidisciplinary approach. The primary benefit to be derived from this conference is to
bring a broader and more complete understanding of state-of-the-art research to both established investigators
and those new to the research area. It is hoped that from this understanding will come new research initiatives and
collaborations and that new researchers will be recruited to the field. The requested DOE support will enhance the
public benefit to be derived by expanding the ASA's current efforts to obtain the widest range of worldwide expertise
for the conference. 



The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing
an international forum for the dissemination of the latest information on radiation dosimetry and risk assessment.
Issues related to human health effects and exposure to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation generate intense public
concern. Some of these concerns include the risk of cancer in nuclear workers, the risk of disease in children due to
parental exposure to radiation, and the risks associated to electric and magnetic fields (from power lines and everyday
electric appliances). Nuclear workers, the public, and Federal, State, and local government officials constantly
seek out information concerning cancer risk as it relates to nuclear energy and technology. The proposed conference
will review current issues related to the potential health risks associated with these exposures. It is anticipated
that there would be several significant scientific and technical advancements from such a meeting which would be
shared not only with the participants but also with the scientific community and the interested public through publication
of the proceedings. This information can be used by epidemiologists, health physicists, and other public health
officials to estimate radiation exposure and potential health risks. As a supplement to other Federal assistance
in the amount of $20,000 plus $22,000 in non-Federal funding, the $50,000 requested from the DOE will enhance the public
benefit to be derived by expanding the ASA's current efforts to obtain the widest range of worldwide expertise for
the conference. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity. 

Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the proposal
represents a beneficial method and approach to publicly disseminate information on radiation dosimetry and risk
assessment.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

DOE Golden Field Office, through the Chicago Support Office, announces that, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance
Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) it intends to award a grant to the Minnesota Department of Public Service (DPS) to continue
to support a renewable energy resource assessment program by expanding data collection and analysis of potential
wind energy in the southwestern part of Minnesota.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DPS is the designated State Energy Office responsible for conducting activities under the State Energy Conservation
Program. DPS has been extensively involved in efforts to facilitate the use of renewable energy electricity generation,
which is an initiative encouraged by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This award will further
the aim of renewable energy electricity generation by the continued monitoring of designated sites in southwestern
Minnesota where wind energy data is being gathered. This will permit a more accurate way to determine the energy potential
that large numbers of wind electric conversion systems (WECS) have on the present electricity supply in Minnesota.
This work is being conducted in cooperation with Northern States Power Company, which presently has WECS installed
and operating in the region. Therefore, the grant application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other organization
that is conducting or planning to conduct this type of effort. The project period for the grant award is 24 months, with
the second year expected to begin on July 1, 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $15,000 for this budget
period.

ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office announces that pursuant to the Financial Assistance Rules
10 CFR 600.7, it intends to award a cooperative agreement resulting from an unsolicited research proposal offered
by Montana State University. The objective of the work that Montana State University will be performing is as follows:
(1) To study and develop reasonable Data Quality Objectives (DQO) approaches and processes to obtain only the data
necessary for effective decision making relative to remediation site sample characterizations and (2) to improve
the substance and objectivity of the national debate on nuclear waste and remediation issues by providing a quantitative
evaluation of the risks associated with the cleanup process.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The statutory authority for the proposed award is the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91),
as amended. The proposal meets the criteria for ``non-competitive'' financial assistance as set forth in 10 CFR Part
600.7(b)(2)(i)(A). The applicant is a state institution of higher education. To date DOE and the EPA have provide
approximately $2,400,000 (over a six year period) to MSU's research and development programs in the areas of environmental
restoration and waste management. Under these earlier awards MSU has initiated several major research studies,
including one focused on enhancing the DQO process. These studies are ongoing and will build upon progress already
made by MSU in previous awards.



The anticipated total project period to be awarded is three years. DOE will provide $1,050,000 over this three year
period. $350,000 is proposed for FY 1995. Montana State University will share approximately ten (10) percent of the
total project costs.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant
to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f), DOE intends to award a grant to Pacific Northwest Pollution Prevention
Research Center (PPRC) for Activities to Enhance Researchers Throughout North America. The anticipated overall
objective is to support specific industry-related activity in the areas of pollution prevention research.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

PPRC proposes to build a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy to support specific industry-related
activity in the areas of pollution prevention research. The specific objectives of the PPRC are: 




(1) To develop and maintain a national clearinghouse for Requests for Proposals (RFPs) on pollution prevention research
in order to attract more qualified researchers in the field.

(2) To conduct a detailed analysis of funding organizations, to better educate both funders and grant seekers on organizational
priorities and current activities.

(3) To expand the PPRC database of current and recent research projects in order to avoid wasteful duplication of research
efforts and stimulate interest in project results.

(4) To publish and disseminate a comprehensive resource guide to pollution prevention research funding, to encourage
proposals and publicize funding programs.

Therefore, the grant application is being accepted because DOE knows of no other organization that is conducting
or planning to conduct this type of effort in pollution prevention.

The project period for the grant award is 12-months, expected to begin in June 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in
the amount of $45,000 for this project period.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Acceptance of an unsolicited proposal application of a grant award with Texas A&M University.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to award financial assistance
(grant) through the Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center To Texas A&M University for a research effort entitled
`` Investigation of the Effect of Coal Particle Sizes on the Interfacial and Rheological Properties of Coal-Water
Slurry Fuels.''.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Grant Number: DE-FG22-94PC94120. 




Title of Research Effort



``Investigation of the Effect of Coal Particle Sizes on the Interfacial and Rheological Properties of Coal-Water
Slurry Fuels.''



Awardee: 

Texas A&M University.



Term of Assistance Effort: 

Twenty-four (24) months. 



Grant Estimated Total Value: 

$99,670.00.



Objective:

 Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.14, the objective of this grant is for Texas A&M University to determine
the effect coal particle size on the surface properties and rheology of coal-water slurry (CWS) fuels containing
different surfactant. Coal powder samples of different size ranges will be obtained from a single source of coal through
sieving. CWS mixtures to be tested will be prepared from these individual samples with known particle sizes. Properties
of the CWS fuel samples to be measured will include the apparent viscosity, static and dynamic surface tensions. In
order to correlate the measured surface properties and rheological data with the atomization characteristics,
a cross-injected spray into convective air stream will be tested. Detailed characteristics of the spray development
will also be investigated using a high-speed photographic recording technique. The results of these investigations
will provide comprehensive information on the spray development and atomization behaviors that are known to depend
to an uncertain degree on the surface properties and rheology. This effort will also contribute to developing guidelines
for CWS fuel preparation technology. The potential to achieve the stated objectives is very high. Therefore the proposed
effort will present a unique opportunity to expand the fundamental understanding of slurry atomization.

<DOCTITLE>Pacific Gas Transmission Co.; Amendment </DOCTITLE>


June 6, 1994. 



Take notice that on May 31, 1994, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT), 160 Spear Street, San Francisco, California
94105-1570, filed in Docket No. CP93-618-001 an amendment to its application filed on August 5,
1993. The amendment was filed pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). PGT now seeks a Certificate of Public
Convenience and Necessity authority it to build and operate only two extensions of its mainline facilities and to
provide transportation service over those extensions. All other requests in the August 5, 1993, filing have been
withdrawn and some of the terms of the service on the extensions have been changed. The two mainline extensions would
serve customers in Oregon, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 

PGT seeks authorization to construct and operate two pipeline extensions or laterals, along with new metering facilities
on the extensions. The first one is the Medford Extension which will begin near PGT's Station 14 at Bonanza, Oregon
and interconnect with the facilities of WP Natural Gas (an operating division of The Washington Water Power Company)
(WP Natural), at Klamath Falls, Keno and Medford, Oregon. The Medford Extension will be about 86 miles long and will
be made of 12-inch pipe. The cost of the Medford Extension is estimated to be $37.9 million in ``as-spent dollars''.
PGT proposes to transport 16,400 MMBtu per day on an annual basis and 15,000 MMBTu per day on a winter-only basis for
WP Natural over the Medford Extension. 

The second pipeline extension is the Coyote Springs Extension which will begin at milepost No. 304 on PGT'S mainline
(south of Stanfield, Oregon), and connect to Portland General Electric Company's (Portland General) proposed electric
generation facility near Boardman, Oregon. The Coyote Springs Extension will be about 18 miles long and will be made
of 12-inch pipe. The cost of the Coyote Springs Extension is estimated to be $8.1 million in ``as-spent dollars''.
PGT proposes to transport 41,000 MMBtu per day on an annual basis for Portland General over the Coyote Springs Extension.


PGT states that WP Natural and Portland General will be responsible for arranging for gas supply and any other related
authorizations. PGT will receive gas requested by these shippers at various receipt points, primarily the International
Boundary with Canada, and will deliver gas on their behalf at various delivery points also nominated by these shippers.


PGT proposes to provide service to WP Natural and Portland General under its existing Part 284 Blanket Certificate.
The transportation will be under the terms and conditions of PGT's FTS-1 rate schedule. PGT will charge WP Natural

ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Implementation of Special Refund Procedures. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the proposed procedures for disbursement
of the total amount of $2,226,782.70 in crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order
that Mt. Airy Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay
B. McLean, David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, entered into with DOE on November 14, 1990. Case
No. LEF-0121. OHA has tentatively determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified
Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute the
total amount of $2,226,782.70 obtained under the terms of a Consent Order that DOE entered into with Mt. Airy Refining
Company and its former shareholders on November 14, 1990. The Consent Order settles claims by DOE that Mt. Airy had
violated reporting provisions of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations and the Administrative Procedures
and Sanctions Regulations with regard to its sale of crude oil. 



OHA proposes to distribute the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided
between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the
states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control
period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree
to which they can demonstrate injury. 

Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to forward two copies of their submissions, within 30 days of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. Comments so received, will be made available for public inspection
between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room
1E-234, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.

Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy 


Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 





Name of Firm: 

Mt. Airy Refining Company. 


Date of Filing: 

February 3, 1994. 


Case Number: 

LEF-0121. 




Dated: June 3, 1994. 




On February 3, 1994, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy filed a Petition requesting
that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement Subpart V special refund proceedings for crude
oil overcharge funds. Under DOE procedural regulations, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund
monies to persons injured by violations of DOE petroleum price and allocation regulations, provided DOE is unable
to readily identify such persons or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. 10 CFR 205.280. We have
considered ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of $2,226,782.70 remitted by Mt. Airy
Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay B. McLean,
David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, in connection with a Consent Order Mt. Airy and its former
shareholders entered into with DOE and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. 
The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds were remitted to DOE to remedy the firm's alleged violation of the Mandatory Petroleum
Allocation Regulations published at 10 CFR part 211 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions
Regulations set forth at 10 CFR part 205. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the United
States Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. This Decision sets forth OHA's tentative
plan to distribute those funds. The specific application requirements appear in Section III of this Decision. Because
these procedures are set forth in proposed form, refund applications should not be filed at this time. Comments are
solicited.

I. Jurisdiction and Authority 


The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth
at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where DOE cannot readily identify persons injured
as a result of actual or alleged violations of its regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive.
For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds see, 

Office of Enforcement, 

9 DOE  82,508 (1981) and 

Office of Enforcement, 

8 DOE  82,597 (1981). 


II. Background 


Mt. Airy operated a refinery in Mt. Airy, Louisiana from the date of its incorporation under the laws of the state of
Ohio in 1977 until its dissolution on August 11, 1983. It was therefore a ``refiner'' as that term has been defined in
the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. As such, Mt. Airy was subject to the jurisdiction of DOE.

In accordance with the reporting requirements found at 10 CFR 211.66(b)(h), Mt. Airy was required to submit a ``Refiners
Monthly Report'' detailing its crude oil receipts, runs to stills and volume of crude oil processed. DOE reviewed
Mt. Airy's compliance with those regulatory provisions, as well as provisions set forth at section 211.67, during
the course of an audit of Mt. Airy's principal business operations. The audit was conducted during the period beginning
on January 1, 1977 and ending on January 27, 1981. On July 25, 1986, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) which
found that Mt. Airy had improperly reported its crude oil receipts for the period beginning July 1977 and ending November
1977, by approximately 300,000 barrels of controlled crude oil. 
ERA amended that Proposed Remedial Order on May 27, 1987 (the May 1987 PRO) to include additional entitlement reporting
violations by Mt. Airy. In its May 1987 PRO ERA found that Mt. Airy under reported its crude receipts by a total of (i)
1,018,905 barrels of controlled crude oil; or (ii) 718,905 barrels of controlled crude oil, in the event OHA found
that Mt. Airy was not required to report the 300,000 barrels identified in the original PRO. The May 1987 PRO directs
Mt. Airy to refund the amount of its violation, plus interest. The PRO further states that Mt. Airy shareholders were
individually liable, to the extent that Mt. Airy's assets were distributed to them upon its dissolution in 1983, for
refunding the violation amount. 
ERA found that shareholder liability in this case was predicated upon the ``trust fund doctrine'', which provides
that stockholders who receive assets upon corporate dissolution hold those assets in trust for the payment of bona
fide corporate debts incurred before dissolution. See 

Bayport, 

18 DOE  83,007 at 86,058 (1989). Mt. Airy and its former shareholders vigorously contested the May 1987 PRO in
proceedings before OHA. Nonetheless, without admitting any violations, they agreed to enter into a Consent Order
with DOE to settle the alleged violations. The Consent Order was published in proposed form in the 

Federal Register

 on November 26, 1990 (the November 1990 Order). 55 FR 49104.

1

 




According to the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy's alleged violations resulted in its receipt of $2,059,649.94 in entitlements
which it was not authorized to receive. The maximum potential liability, with interest, was estimated by ERA as roughly
$7.6 million. 

Id. 

After assessing a number of factors, including the time and expense required to litigate fully every issue in order
to obtain any recovery, ERA concluded that the resolution of the matters referred to in the Proposed Consent Order
for the principal sum of $2,000,000 was both an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. 

Id.

 
In accordance with the November 1990 Order, Mt. Airy and its former shareholders (1) paid the principal sum of two million
dollars ($2,000,000.00), plus interest, in full and final settlement of all matters covered by the Order; and (2)
agreed to retain (i) Mt. Airy's records evidencing sales volume data for each product subject to controls, during
the period covered by the audit; and (ii) Mt. Airy's customers' names and addresses. The November 1990 Order requires
Mt. Airy to retain the records described above for a period of thirty (30) days following DOE's final distribution
of the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds or January 1, 2000, whichever occurs earlier. Mt. Airy shall make such information
available to DOE, if so requested. 


III. The Proposed Refined Product Refund Procedures 


A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 


The Mt. Airy Consent Order funds will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP). See 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). This policy has been utilized in all subpart V proceedings
involving alleged crude oil violations. See Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). Under the
MSRP, 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be refunded to the Federal government, another 40 percent to
the states, and up to 20 percent may initially be reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also
specified that, after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid, any remaining monies will be disbursed to the
Federal government and to the states in equal amounts. For a more detailed discussion of the MSRP see, 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 

653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,509 (1986)(the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).

<TEXT>
 

In its April 10, 1987 Notice, OHA stated that Subpart V claimants, anticipating filing refund applications for crude
oil monies, would generally be required to (1) document the volume of petroleum products they purchased from August
19, 1973 to January 27, 1981; and (2) prove they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. End-users of petroleum
products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry are presumed injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges
and therefore need not submit additional proof of injury. End-users need only document the volume of their petroleum
purchases in order to be eligible to receive a refund. See 

City of Columbus, Georgia, 

16 DOE  85,550 (1987). 



B. Refund Claims 



We propose that standard DOE procedures, as set forth in the MSRP, govern the distribution of the $2,226,782.70 in
crude oil monies obtained from Mt. Airy. We have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund ($445,357.00) for
direct refunds to applicants. We propose that refund applications in the Mt. Airy proceeding be evaluated in exactly
the same manner as refund applications submitted in other crude oil proceedings. Applicants generally will be required
to document the volume of petroleum products they purchased and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged
violations. We will adopt a presumption that the alleged crude oil overcharges were absorbed rather than passed on,
by applicants who were (1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject
to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751-760h.
In order to receive a refund, end-user applicants need only document the volume of petroleum products they purchased.
See 

Shell, 

17 DOE  85,204 (1988). Petroleum retailer, reseller and refiner applicants will be required to submit detailed
evidence of injury. They may not rely upon the injury presumptions utilized in some refined product refund cases.


Id

. 

As has been stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application
for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. See 

e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 

15 DOE  85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim in any other crude oil refund proceeding implemented
by the DOE need not file another claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings
implemented by DOE. Any applicant who has executed and submitted a valid waiver, pursuant to one of the escrow accounts
established by the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, has waived his right to file an application for Subpart V crude
oil refund monies. See 

Mid-America Dairymen 

v. 

Herrington, 

878 F.2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines  26,617 (1989); 

In re: Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 

707 F. Supp. 11267 (D. Kan.), 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines  26,613 (1987). 

The current deadline for filing an Application for Refund is June 30, 1994. All crude oil refund claims filed before
June 30, 1994, will be paid at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. We anticipate, however, that applicants who filed their
claims by June 30, 1988, will receive a supplemental refund payment. We will decide in the future whether applicants
that filed applications after that date should receive additional refunds. Applicants may be required to submit
additional information to support their claims for future amounts. Notice of any such additional amounts will be
published in the 

Federal Register

. 



C. Payments to the States and Federal Government 



Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining 80 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject
to this Proposed Decision or $1,781,426.00 in principal, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares
to the states and Federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption
of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds allocated to
each state is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to
the same limitations and reporting requirements that apply to any other crude oil funds received by the states in accordance
with the Stripper Well Agreement. 

It Is Therefore Ordered That: 

The $2,226,782.70 refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Mt. Airy and its former shareholders pursuant
to the Consent Order finalized on January 17, 1991 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statements and Regulations; Availability of EPA Comments </DOCTITLE>



Availability of EPA comments prepared May 23, 1994 through May 27, 1994 
pursuant to the Environmental Review Process (ERP), under Section 309 of the 
Clean Air Act and Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act 
as amended. Requests for copies of EPA comments can be directed to the Office of Federal Activities at (202) 260-5076.


An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements (EISs) was published in FR dated
April 8, 1994 (59 FR 16807). 



Draft EISs 





ERP No. D-BLM-E65044-FL Rating EC2,

 Florida Land and Resource Management Plan, Implementation, Split-Estate Federal Mineral 
Ownership (FMO), several counties, FL. 



Summary: 

EPA supported alternative 2, but expressed 
environmental concerns regarding the potential wetland and wading bird impacts. 



ERP No. D-FHW-K40202-CA Rating EO2, 

CA-58_Mojave Freeway Project, Construction from 0.1 mile east of the Cache Creek Bridge to 5.0 
miles east of the town of Mojave, Funding, COE Section 404 Permit and Right-of-Way Acquisition, Kern County, CA. 



Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental objections due to the 
loss and fragmentation of habitat for the desert tortoise, a species listed as threatened under the Endangered Species
Act. The preferred alternative 
affects the most desert tortoise habitat despite the US Fish & Wildlife Service's strong recommendation to avoid
habitat loss and fragmentation. EPA's second objection was the failure of the draft EIS to address the requirements
of the Clean Water Act Section 404 or its regulations. The preferred alternative had the most impact to waters of the
United States, according to 
the draft EIS. The final EIS needs to address the project's consistency with Section 404 requirements, including
impact mitigation. 



ERP No. D-FHW-L40189-WA Rating EC2, 

WA-525/Paine Field Boulevard Project, Improvements, between WA-99 to WA-526, Funding and COE
Section 404 Permit, City of Mukitteo, Snohomish County, WA. 



Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental concerns about the 
potential for adverse impacts on water quality, wetlands and fisheries resources. EPA had requested additional
information on effects of the estimated annual pollutant load on water quality, effectiveness 
of mitigation, and potential impacts on natural resources from indirect effects, secondary and cumulative impacts.




ERP No. D-NPS-K61128-CA Rating EC2, 

Santa Rosa Island Development Concept Plan, Implementation and Funding, Channel Islands National Park, Santa Barbara
County, CA. 



Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental concerns regarding 
potential adverse impacts to water quality from the project, particularly construction-related impacts. The final
EIS should closely examine potential project impacts to water quality and water quality mitigation measures which
may prove necessary under the Clean Water Act (stormwater permitting from construction actions, consistency with
California's nonpoint source 
management program). The final EIS should provide details on hazardous substances which could have emanated from
a defunct air force base on the Island. 



Final EISs 





ERP No. F-AFS-K67021-NV, 

Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine Expansion Project, 
Implementation, Plan of Operation and COE Section 404 Permit, Humboldt National Forest, Mountain City Ranger District,
Elko County, NV. 



Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental concerns about the new 
information in the final EIS on the acid potential of waste rock at the project site, EPA had serious concerns regarding
waste rock characterization, 
handling and disposal. 



ERP No. F-DOE-L05204-WA, 

Tenaska_Washington II Generation Electric Power Plant Construction, Operation and NPDES Permit, Pierce County,
WA. 



Summary:

 EPA had a lack of objection to the proposed project. 



ERP No. F-FAA-L51014-WA, 

Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Improvement, South Aviation Support Area, Airport Layout Plan, Airport
Master Plan, Funding, Section 10 and 404 Permits and NPDES Permit, Port of Seattle, King County, WA. 



Summary:

 EPA expressed environmental concerns based on 
potential effects to wetland and aquatic resources. EPA recommended the development of a wetland plan that is an enforceable
condition of a 404 permit. Mitigation measures to deal with flow attenuation in Des Moines Creek remain inadequate.
EPA recommended that the types and amounts of pollutants that will enter Puget Sound be documented in the Record of

Decision. 



ERP No. F-IBR-K39032-CA, 

All-American Canal (AAC) Lining Project, 
Construction and Operation, Lining a 23-mile Canal from Pilot Knob to Drop 4, Controlling Water Seepage, Imperial
Irrigation District, Imperial 
County, CA. 



Summary:

 EPA had no objection to the proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Statement of Policy on System Institution Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories; Extension
of Comment Period </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Farm Credit Administration. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed statement of policy; comment period extension. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Board published for comment a proposed ``Statement of Policy on System Institution
Activities Involving the Potential for Nonexclusive Territories'' in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17543). The comment period is scheduled to expire on June 13, 1994. The FCA Board hereby gives
notice that the original comment period is extended to July 13, 1994. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The 1971 Act authorizes the FCA to issue and amend the charters of System institutions and regulate the exercise of
their powers. Included in this authority is the ability for the FCA to issue or amend charters or promulgate regulations
that would result in increased competition among System institutions. The issue of competition among System institutions
arises, typically, in two types of situations. First, charters could be issued authorizing two or more System institutions
to extend the same types of credit services to the same types of customers in the same geographic territories; such
charters have typically been issued as a result of mergers or other chartering actions requested by institutions.
Second, institutions could be authorized by regulation to engage in certain activities outside of their chartered
territories. 



The FCA Board has determined that an extended comment period would be beneficial in order to ensure that all interested
parties have an opportunity to comment on the proposed statement of policy on System institution activities involving
the potential for nonexclusive territories.

Neighborhood-Based Childhood Lead; Primary Prevention Program; Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994


Introduction


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of grant funds in fiscal year (FY)
1994 for the initiation of primary prevention activities that demonstrate a neighborhood-based approach to preventing
and eliminating lead exposure for children living in high-risk housing. This primary prevention program is funded
by CDC with support from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement
and Poisoning Prevention (OLBPAPP).
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.
This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of Healthy People
2000, see 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

 section.)


Authority


This program is authorized under sections 301(a) (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) and 317A (42 U.S.C. 247b-1) of the Public
Health Service Act, as amended, and section 1011(a-f) of Title X (42 U.S.C. 4851 

et seq.

) of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act. Program regulations are set forth in Title 42, Code of
Federal Regulations, Part 51b.


Smoke-Free Workplace


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people.


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants are the 37 current recipients of CDC grant funds for State and Community-based Childhood Lead
Poisoning Prevention Programs that meet both of the following requirements (prior to the grant award being made):
1. At the time of the grant application, an applicant must have an approved Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy
(CHAS) under section 105 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), (42 U.S.C. 12705) that includes a lead-hazard
control element. Current CHAS regulations are set forth in title 24, Code of Federal Regulations,  576.31.
(Applicants are permitted to use an abbreviated housing strategy, as set forth in  91.25 of the CHAS regulations.)
2. By September 1, 1994, applicants must have State enabling legislation and promulgated regulations in place to
establish a State Certification and Accreditation Program for contractors, inspectors, workers, and others engaged
in lead hazard control activities. The State Certification Program shall be consistent with the currently identified
elements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Model State Plan being developed under Title IV, sections
402 and 404, of the Toxic Substances Control Act (see Appendix E of the HUD NOFA). (For ordering a copy of the HUD NOFA,
see 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

 section.)
The applicant must furnish copies of the enabling legislation and/or promulgated regulations, as well as other appropriate
documentation, as proof of the program.


Availability of Funds


Approximately $2,500,000 will be available to fund up to two neighborhood-based childhood lead poisoning primary
prevention programs. Awards for the first budget year will range from $750,000 to $1,250,000 each. Awards are expected
to begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within project periods not to exceed
3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change based on the actual availability of funds.
These grants are intended to develop, expand, or improve collaboration among childhood lead poisoning prevention
programs, community housing agencies, and neighborhood groups to ensure the identification and reduction of lead
hazards in neighborhoods with a large proportion of demonstrated high-risk housing, and with a high percentage of
young children living in these houses. Grant awards cannot supplant existing funding for childhood lead poisoning
prevention programs or hazard reduction activities. Eligible applicants may enter into contracts, including consortia
agreements, as necessary, to meet the requirements of the program and strengthen the overall application.


Note


 Not more than 10 percent of any grant may be obligated for administrative costs.
 HUD funds under this announcement should target ``priority housing''_defined as housing that qualifies
as affordable housing under section 215 (appendix G of HUD NOFA) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing
Act (42 U.S.C. 12745). Priority housing does not include public housing (whether Federal or locally supported),
federally owned housing, or any federally assisted housing except tenant-based housing that receives assistance
under sections 8(b) or 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(b) or (o)).
 Applicants are advised that an operational State Certification and Accreditation Program is an essential
prerequisite for implementing lead hazard reduction activities.


Purpose


Historically, most approaches to childhood lead poisoning have been reactive. After a child has been identified
as poisoned, action may be taken to investigate the home environment to identify and address lead hazards. This approach
provides epidemiologic and some preventive benefits by identifying and providing for the control of demonstrated,
immediate hazards to which the same children, their siblings, and playmates might subsequently be exposed. However,
relying solely on the presence of poisoned children to identify housing that contains lead hazards is considered
to be ``secondary prevention,'' in that it postpones action until after a child is exposed to lead. Moreover, the reactive,
child-by-child and house-by-house approach is an inefficient use of resources in the long run. A ``primary prevention''
approach emphasizes identifying and correcting lead hazards in the neighborhood 

before children are poisoned,

 shifting the focus from the poisoned child to the environmental exposure source_most often, the child's home.

This joint CDC/HUD grant program will provide financial assistance and support to State and local government agencies
to develop and implement a comprehensive neighborhood-based, holistic approach to ensure lead hazard control in
a small, well defined neighborhood with a high percentage of high risk housing. These ``Primary Prevention'' demonstration
projects are intended to bring together representatives from public health, the medical community, housing and
rehabilitation, Community-based/Neighborhood-based Organizations (CBOs), business and labor interests, and
other organizations interested in developing or expanding neighborhood-based lead poisoning primary prevention
projects in targeted communities. The goal of these projects will be to develop or enhance neighborhood-based efforts
to prevent and eliminate lead exposure for children living in high-risk neighborhoods.


Essential Components of the Primary Prevention Project Include


1. Identifying a high-risk neighborhood.
2. Establishing, expanding, or improving environmental investigations to identify sources of lead for children
in the selected neighborhood.
3. Characterizing and prioritizing lead hazards in neighborhoods.
4. Ensuring/providing effective rapid reduction, control, and abatement of lead hazards throughout the neighborhood.
Priority for activities should be given to reducing and controlling lead hazards posing an immediate threat to children.
5. Planning hazard reduction, control, and abatement activities to take advantage of economies of scale for labor
and materials.
6. Utilizing ``opportunity points'' when environmental intervention is especially convenient and/or timely (e.g.,
unit turnover, planned weatherization, remodeling, or renovation).
7. Ensuring/providing interim lead-safe housing for families during hazard reduction.
8. Enhancing primary prevention knowledge and skills for residents, owners, landlords, etc., in high-risk neighborhoods
through training and other methods. This includes planning and implementing a neighborhood education campaign.
9. Building coalitions and ensuring neighborhood participation in all components of this project, including the
planning process.
10. Training of staff and neighborhood residents to plan, implement, maintain, and evaluate all aspects of the primary
prevention strategy.


Program Requirements


The following are requirements for the Primary Prevention Projects:
A. A full-time director/coordinator with authority and responsibility to carry out the requirements of this primary
prevention program. There must be sufficient grantee capability to plan, implement, coordinate, and maintain all
aspects of the primary prevention strategy.
B. A plan to identify lead hazards in the neighborhood in a systematic manner and to oversee the safe and effective lead
hazard reduction and control.
C. A plan to ensure that primary prevention activities are also directed at neighborhood properties not specifically
eligible under the definition of ``priority housing''.
D. A plan to identify and ensure participation of neighborhood groups that have an interest in providing lead-safe
housing, and a lead-safe neighborhood.
E. Assurances of compliance with HUD/EPA or other appropriate certification and training requirements, as well
as other regulations relating to hazard reduction and worker safety.
F. Information which describes why a certain neighborhood was selected for this primary prevention activity, including
information on housing conditions, income, other socioeconomic factors, and previous surveys or screening activities
for childhood lead poisoning prevention. The selected neighborhood must be a defined geographic area of contiguous
blocks.
G. Assurances and documentation that activities, services, and educational materials provided by the program are
endorsed by neighborhood leaders or representatives of the intended target neighborhood.
H. A comprehensive plan for program evaluation. Applicants should develop plans for evaluating program activities
in two ways: Process Evaluations should be included for each component of the Program Plan. Process Evaluations should
determine whether program activities were actually carried out as planned. An overall Outcome Evaluation for the
program should be described separately. The Outcome Evaluation should be designed to measure, to the extent feasible,
the impact of the program on the neighborhood environment and health status of children.


Evaluation Criteria


CDC will use the following evaluation criteria to rate and rank applications received in response to this Program
Announcement. The review of applications will be conducted by an objective review committee who will review the quality

 Notice of availability of funds.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the availability of up to $10.5 million in fiscal
year (FY) 1994 funds to be awarded as cooperative agreements under the Special Projects of National Significance
(SPNS) program. The SPNS program, authorized by section 2618(a) of the Public Health Service Act, receives its appropriation
of funds through Public Law 103-112. Project periods can be from three to five years, subject to Congressional
reauthorization in FY 1996 of the Ryan White CARE Act. This announcement solicits two types of applications: (1) HIV
service delivery model demonstration projects, or (2) HIV service delivery model demonstration projects in conjunction
with an evaluation and dissemination center. The SPNS program, in collaboration with the evaluation and dissemination
center(s), will sponsor multi-site program evaluation studies. All HIV service delivery model demonstration projects
agree, as a condition of grant award, to participate in these studies. Awards will be made to achieve population and
geographic diversity.


The SPNS program is designed to demonstrate and evaluate innovative and potentially replicable HIV service delivery
models. The authorizing legislation specifies three SPNS program objectives: (1) To support the development of
innovative models of HIV care; (2) to evaluate the effectiveness of innovative program designs; and (3) to promote
replication of effective models. Therefore, crucial factors in appraising proposals for the HIV service delivery
model demonstration projects will include the applicant's plan for conducting an evaluation of the model, the program's
potential to improve access to, coordination of, and quality of, HIV service delivery, and a plan for disseminating
findings about the model's effectiveness.
Because of the complexity of this program, a cooperative agreement mechanism is being utilized to allow for substantial
Federal programmatic participation in the conduct of the program, and to facilitate communication and coordination
in the overall implementation and evaluation of the program. A steering committee will be established to facilitate
coordination and cooperation among the service demonstration projects and the evaluation and dissemination center(s),
and to oversee the cooperative agreements.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background and Objectives 


The SPNS program endeavors to advance knowledge and skills in HIV service delivery, stimulate the design of innovative
models of care, and support the development of effective delivery systems for these services. SPNS accomplishes
its purpose through funding and technical support of innovative HIV service delivery models. For purposes of this
announcement, models seeking SPNS support must address at least one of the four (4) new service delivery system categories
described below. Additional funding will be provided to one or more interested grantees to establish, either on site
or by subcontract, evaluation and dissemination center(s) to provide technical assistance to grantees in the design
and implementation of evaluation studies and dissemination activities, in collaboration with the SPNS program
and the funded applicants. 
In establishing the current special project categories, consideration was given to the priority service areas identified
in the concept paper, ``Future Directions: Increasing Knowledge about Health and Support Service Delivery to People
with HIV Disease.'' This document was developed through interviews with, and written comments from, key HRSA staff
and experts inside and outside the U.S. Public Health Service, and through a review of relevant HIV-related service
delivery, research, evaluation, policy, and planning documents. 


Descriptions: HIV Service Delivery Model Categories 


The Special Project Categories for FY 1994 will support the implementation and evaluation of innovative HIV service
delivery models. SPNS funds cannot be used for expenses related to the provision of medical care; supportive services;
or any other expenses currently reimbursed, subsidized or eligible for reimbursement through third party payors,
grants awarded under Titles I-IV of the Ryan White CARE Act, or other grant and foundation sources. Applicants may
not submit proposals for more than one subcategory in a category. 
Proposals will be accepted for HIV service delivery model projects that demonstrate and evaluate: 
(1) 

Comprehensive primary care service delivery systems for people with HIV within one of the distinct environments
or settings described in the six following sub-categories. 
(a) Develop and evaluate the effectiveness of including new or existing support services as part of the basic benefits
of a managed care plan or a comprehensive, coordinated care system. 
Because one of the potential strengths of managed care plans or coordinated care systems is their capacity to coordinate
the services of several providers, the proposed service delivery model must test its ability to meet the wide range
of service needs required by individuals with HIV. These service needs, in addition to primary care, may include,
but are not limited to, specialty medical care, mental health services, substance abuse treatment, and/or assistance
with locating housing, transportation, child care, etc. Grantees must evaluate changes in: (1) Patient adherence
to medical treatment plans; (2) access to and use of medical and support services; (3) costs per-patient of providing
both medical and support services; and (4) patient satisfaction with services. 
(b) Test the feasibility of providing comprehensive HIV services under a 
capitated reimbursement system (including, but not limited to, Ryan White CARE Act Title I and Title II funds). 
Grantees must evaluate patterns of utilization of medical and support services under a capitated system, compare
the costs of delivering services under a capitated reimbursement system with a fee-for-service system, and evaluate
client satisfaction. 
(c) Add primary care services to an intermediate level of care, i. e., subsidized housing, residential care, shelter,
partial hospitalization, or other type of ``step down'' setting, for individuals with HIV disease. 
Grantees must evaluate the effectiveness of primary care services provided in this environment on reducing dependence
on inpatient hospitalization, increasing the continuity of medical care, and improving client satisfaction. 
(d) Develop, in a geographically defined rural area, a comprehensive continuum of care for the purpose of increasing
accessibility and quality of primary and specialty medical care to its residents with HIV disease. 
Grantees must explain how the proposed model accommodates the needs of the residents with HIV disease in relation
to the health service delivery system characteristics of the area. Based on the needs of the area, models that supplement
primary medical care with case management, psychosocial support, and other non-medical support services are encouraged.

(e) Develop a service delivery model for adolescents and young adults (up to age 25) with CDC-defined Stage III or IV
HIV disease that effectively manages their medical and, when appropriate, substance abuse treatment needs. 
Grantees should evaluate the model's effectiveness in meeting the full range of physical, psychological, social,
and spiritual needs of adolescents and young adults who are seriously or terminally ill.

(f) Develop a service delivery model for women with HIV disease that emphasizes the coordination of services from
outreach, counseling and HIV testing, including expanded counseling and testing during pregnancy, through early
intervention and care, including appropriate therapeutic drug regimens, for asymptomatic and symptomatic disease,
and for prevention of transmission of HIV during pregnancy and delivery. 
Grantees must describe how the proposed model is using innovative features to reach pregnant women and women at high
risk (e.g., substance abusing women) who have been reluctant to become engaged in traditional counseling/testing
services, and how these women will be engaged and retained in care systems for themselves during and after pregnancy.
Priority will be given to applicants in States or cities which have made the decision to ``routinely recommend'' that
women (during pregnancy and/or whenever they receive primary care services) learn their HIV infection status for
the purposes of improving their own care and health status; preventing transmission to their infants during pregnancy;
and preventing transmission during breastfeeding. The funds will be used primarily to support system development
and organizing and training providers. The intent of this sub-category is to foster systems of care for women with
HIV; to encourage more women to know their infection status; to encourage States and cities to develop plans for accomplishing
this; and to assess the reasons for and impact of the various decisions women make regarding HIV testing, use of AZT
during pregnancy, and adherence to follow-up care decisions made jointly with providers. 

(2) Coordinated delivery of HIV health and support services to specific mobile populations in the United States,
ensuring the delivery of continuous services throughout the course of HIV disease. 
For the purposes of this category, mobile populations are defined as border populations; populations with migration
patterns primarily between the continental United States and its territories and commonwealths and between the
United States and other countries; migrant farm labor workers; and, undocumented workers and residents. Examples
of services needed by these populations include primary medical care, mental health services, and advocacy or other
legal support services that address AIDS discrimination and access to care. Special attention must be paid to ensuring
and documenting continuity of care for clients that receive care from providers located in different geographical
locations. SPNS is seeking innovative methods of interagency communication and for tracking referrals between
providers so that longitudinal follow-up of clients from provider to provider will be possible. Grantees must evaluate
their success at ensuring continuity of medical care and access to needed support services. 
(3) Reduction of cultural, linguistic, and/or organizational barriers to care in a geographically defined area
(e.g., neighborhood, community, region, state). 
Grantees must have the capacity to analyze reductions in organizational barriers to accessing care. AIDS service
providers and other community-based organizations located in the geographic area and staffed by the cultural and/or
linguistic group to be served by the proposed service delivery model are encouraged to apply under this category.
Grantees submitting a proposal under Category 

#

3 must address one of the following four populations: 

(a) An underserved population group experiencing significant barriers to care (e.g., men of color, HIV infected
women, AIDS survivors, etc.) by addressing their access to care issues through organizational collaboration and
inclusion in policy development. 
The grantee chooses the target population in this sub-category based on documented evidence that this population
affected by HIV disease is not receiving services. At a minimum, collaboration among providers must include all Ryan
White CARE Act-funded grantees in the area that serve the targeted population. 
(b) An ethnic group facing both linguistic and cultural barriers. 
A critical component of a proposed model in this sub-category must be the involvement of individuals and/or community-based
organizations with established service relationships with the targeted special population. 

(c) Active substance abusers utilizing primary care on an intermittent basis or who do not adhere to their treatment
regiment. 
Models for expanding enrollment and enhancing retention of HIV infected substance users, particularly active users,
in primary care may include methods of increasing primary care providers' knowledge, receptiveness, and skill in
treating this population. 
(d) Individuals or special populations experiencing HIV-based discrimination in health care, employment, and/or
housing, that inhibits their receipt and/or utilization of health care services. 
Grantees must demonstrate and evaluate how innovative advocacy services targeting HIV discrimination impacts
access to and utilization of appropriate health care for people whose needs are already complicated by cultural,
linguistic or organizational issues. 
(4) 

Provider training and education models that develop, test, and evaluate strategies for increasing, improving or
updating knowledge about HIV disease and its treatment for providers in rural areas, correctional facilities or
mental health services programs and facilities. 
Grantees should collaborate, when feasible, with existing AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETC) and other
training centers already providing education services to a wide variety of health care providers. Adoption, or adaptation
to local conditions, of existing training models with outcome oriented evaluation is encouraged. The project's
evaluation must specify the extent to which providers incorporate new skills and knowledge into their practices,
and if there are any changes in numbers of people with HIV disease served by the provider. Evaluation designs comparing
the results between different levels or intensity of training are encouraged. 



Review Criteria: HIV Service Delivery Models 


All applications for HIV Service Delivery Model cooperative agreements described under Category (1) through (4)
above and submitted to the SPNS program will be reviewed and rated by an objective review panel. Factors for the technical
review of applications are as follows:

Additional Funding for SPNS Evaluation & Dissemination Center(s)



In addition to the funds provided to successful applicants for development of service delivery model demonstration
projects, additional funds will be provided to one or more successful applicants to establish, either on site or by
subcontract, evaluation and dissemination center(s) to work with all of the SPNS grantees funded under the HIV Service
Delivery Models Categories [1] through [4]. The Center(s) will have two primary responsibilities: (1) to provide
technical assistance to SPNS grantees in designing and implementing evaluation studies and dissemination activities
for their individual projects; and, (2) to develop and coordinate the implementation of cross-cutting evaluations
within groups of similar projects. HRSA staff will offer advice and guidance and participate in each of these areas
as well as monitor the Center's work to assure its progress is in accordance with program objectives and Federal requirements.
HRSA staff may accomplish this task, in part, through an advisory panel composed of Federal employees and external
consultants.

Inclusion of a request for additional funding for the SPNS Evaluation and Dissemination Center is not a mandatory
requirement of the application. Those applications not requesting this additional funding will be given equal consideration
for service delivery model funding. All applications, regardless of inclusion of a request for evaluation center
funding, will be scored first only on the applicant's proposal for the service delivery model. Service delivery model
applications which are approved for funding will then be reviewed for interest in the additional funding. Only then
will proposals for an evaluation and dissemination be reviewed and scored according to the following.



Review Criteria: Additional Funding for SPNS Evaluation & Dissemination Center(s)



Those successful service delivery model applications which include a request for funding for the SPNS Evaluation
and Dissemination Center (Part B) will be eligible for review and rating by an objective review panel of that part of
the application. Applications will be considered for funding on the basis of overall technical merit as determined
through the review process, and the proposed center's suitability for working with the funded SPNS projects. Factors
for the technical review of Part B of the applications will include the following:



Factor 1 (25 points). 

Qualifications and experience of the principal investigator, the proposed staff and consultants in designing and
conducting health service evaluation studies, disseminating study findings and in providing technical assistance
on evaluation and dissemination issues.



Factor 2 (30 points). 

Adequacy of plans for providing technical assistance to SPNS grantees on program evaluation and information dissemination.



Factor 3 (25 points). 

Adequacy of plans for designing and implementing cross-cutting evaluations within groups of similar projects and
for assuring data quality.



Factor 4 (20 points). 

Appropriateness of budget, staffing plans, facilities and information management resources, and time frame for
implementing the project's operational and programmatic objectives.



Role of Federal Staff in Cooperative Agreements



The cooperative agreement mechanism allows for substantial post-award programmatic participation by SPNS staff
in the projects' operations. In addition to the project officer's monitoring function, SPNS staff will be active
participants in the operations of the HIV service delivery model demonstration projects and the SPNS evaluation
and dissemination center. SPNS staff will facilitate the exchange of relevant information among the HIV service
delivery model projects and provide support for training and consultation. SPNS staff will also monitor the function
and activities of the center, assuring satisfactory progress and timely reporting.

``Substantial programmatic participation'' means that SPNS staff will provide guidance and coordination for certain
programmatic activities to a degree beyond their customary stewardship responsibilities in grants administration.

Availability of Funds 



Section 2618, subsection (a) of the Public Health Service Act, ``Special Projects of National Significance,'' permits
the Secretary to allocate up to ten percent of the funds provided for Part B of Title XXVI to award grants directly to
public and non-profit private entities to promote the statute's objectives. Approximately $9.7 million is available
in FY 1994, to fund 25 HIV service delivery model demonstration projects estimating an average annual project budget
of $350,000. The evaluation and dissemination center budget will be based on the availability of funds in relation
to the objective review panel's recommendations. Approximately $600,000 is available in FY 1994 for this Center.
The budget and project periods for approved and funded projects will begin October 1, 1994.

Project periods may be requested for up to five years. However, recommended support beyond the third year is subject
to a determination by an objective review panel in conjunction with an assessment by the SPNS staff of the project's
progress to date. All grants to support projects beyond the first budget year will be contingent upon the availability
of funds, Congressional reauthorization of Ryan White CARE Act funding within the second project year, and satisfactory
progress each year in meeting the project's objectives.

All grantees funded to support HIV service delivery model demonstration projects under this Notice are encouraged
to secure and show evidence of non-SPNS funding support equal to 20 percent of the approved project budget by the fourth
project year, and equal to 40 percent of the approved project budget by the fifth year. Applicants are required to submit,
in the initial application, budgets for each proposed project year.



Eligible Applicants



The statute, Section 2618 (a) (1), specifies that grants may be awarded to public and non-profit private entities
to fund special programs for the care and treatment of people with HIV disease. Eligible entities may include, but
are not limited to, State, local, or tribal public health, mental health, or substance abuse departments; public
or non-profit hospitals; community-based service organizations (e.g., AIDS service organizations, primary health
care clinics, family planning centers, AIDS discrimination and advocacy organizations, hemophilia centers, community
mental health centers, substance abuse treatment centers, urban Indian health centers, migrant health centers,
Ryan White CARE Act Title IIIb clinics, etc.); institutions of higher education; and national service provider and/or
policy development associations/organizations.



Allowable Costs



The basis for determining allocable and allowable costs to be charged to PHS grants is set forth in 45 CFR part 74, Subpart
Q and 45 CFR part 92 for State, local or tribal governments. The four separate sets of cost principles prescribed for
public and private non-profit recipients are: OMB Circular A-87 for State, local or tribal governments; OMB
Circular A-21 for institutions of higher education; 45 CFR part 74, Appendix E for hospitals; and OMB Circular
A-122 for nonprofit organizations.



Reporting and Other Requirements



A successful applicant under this notice will submit semi-annual activity summary reports in accordance with provisions
of the general regulations which apply under 45 CFR Part 74, Subpart J, ``Monitoring and Reporting of Program Performance,''
with the exception of State and local governments to which 45 CFR Part 92, Subpart C reporting requirements apply.
As a condition of all awards funded under this Notice, grantees will be required to cooperate with HRSA and the SPNS
Evaluation and Dissemination center(s) in any multi-site evaluation studies sponsored by the SPNS Program.



Healthy People 2000 Objectives

<DOCTITLE>Notice Regarding Section 602 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992; Manufacturer Audit Guidelines and Informal
Dispute Resolution </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 602 of Public Law 102-585, the ``Veterans Health Care Act of 1992'' (the ``Act''), enacted section 340B
of the Public Health Service Act (``PHS Act''), ``Limitation on Prices of Drugs Purchased by Covered Entities.''
Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical
pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ``Secretary'') in which
the manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed an amount determined under
a statutory formula. 



Section 340B(a)(5) of the PHS Act identifies certain requirements for covered entities concerning potential double
price reductions and drug diversion. A covered entity must permit the manufacturer of a covered outpatient drug that
has signed the Agreement, to audit the records of the covered entity directly pertaining to the entity's compliance
with the requirements of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B) as to drugs purchased from the manufacturer. These audits
must be conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary, as stated in section 340B(a)(5)(C).


Further, the Office of Drug Pricing anticipates that disputes may arise between covered entities and participating
manufacturers regarding implementation of the provisions of section 340B. To resolve these disputes in an expeditious
manner, the Office of Drug Pricing has developed a proposed informal dispute resolution process. 

The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on the proposed manufacturer audit guidelines and the proposed
informal dispute resolution process. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Manufacturer Audit Guidelines 



Covered entities which choose to participate in the section 340B drug discount program must comply with the requirements
of section 340B(a)(5) of the PHS Act. Section 340B(a)(5)(A) prohibits a covered entity from accepting a discount
for a drug that would also generate a Medicaid rebate. Further, section 340B(a)(5)(B) prohibits a covered entity
from reselling or otherwise transferring a discounted drug to a person who is not a patient of the entity. The participating
entity must permit the manufacturer of a covered outpatient drug who has signed the Agreement with the Secretary to
audit its records that directly pertain to the entity's compliance with section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B) requirements
with respect to drugs of the manufacturer. Manufacturer audits must be conducted in accordance with guidelines developed
by the Secretary as required by section 340B(a)(5)(C). This notice does not include the audit guidelines to be used
by Government auditors where the Government performs the audit of the records of the covered entity's compliance
with the requirements of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B). 

The following is the proposed ``Compliance Audit Guide'' concerning manufacturer audit guidelines as developed
by the Secretary pursuant to section 340B(a)(5)(C): 



I. General Guidelines 



A manufacturer shall conduct an audit only when the Office of Drug Pricing determines that there is reasonable cause
to believe a violation of section 340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred. The manufacturer must submit a request for an
audit of a covered entity to the Office of Drug Pricing. [See section II for audit steps]. Auditors have an ethical and
legal responsibility to perform quality audits conducted in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, Current
revision, developed by the Comptroller General of the United States. Patient confidentiality requirements must
also be observed. Audit reports must be prepared at the completion of the audit. Copies of the audit report shall be
prepared in accordance with the reporting standards for performance audits in Government Auditing Standards, Current
Revision. The cost of a manufacturer audit will be borne by the manufacturer, as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(C)
of the PHS Act. 



(a) Number of Audits 



Consistent with Government auditing standards, the organization performing the audit shall coordinate with other
auditors, when appropriate, to avoid duplicating work already completed or that may be planned. Only one audit will
be permitted at any one time. When specific allegations involving the drugs of more than one manufacturer have been
made concerning an entity's failure to comply with section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B), the Office of Drug Pricing will
determine whether an audit should be performed by the (1) Government or (2) the manufacturer. 



(b) Scope of Audits

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00081 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The manufacturer must submit an audit workplan describing the audit to the Office of Drug Pricing for review. The workplan
will be reviewed for reasonable purpose and scope. Further, a determination will be made that only those records of
the covered entity that directly pertain to the potential violation(s) will be accessed including those systems
and processes (e.g., purchasing, distribution, dispensing, and billing) that would assist in identifying a violation.




(c) Duration of Audits 



Audits shall be performed in the minimum time necessary with the minimum intrusion on the covered entity's operations.




II. Audit Steps 



(a) The manufacturer shall notify the covered entity in writing when it believes the covered entity has violated provisions
of section 340B. The manufacturer and the covered entity shall have at least 30 days from the date of notification to
attempt in good faith to resolve the matter. 

(b) The manufacturer has the option to proceed to the informal dispute resolution process described later in the notice
without an audit, if it believes it has sufficient evidence of a violation absent an audit. If the matter is not resolved
and the manufacturer desires to perform an audit, the manufacturer must file a request for a covered entity audit with
the Office of Drug Pricing. [See section ``

For Further Information

'' for address.] The request must set forth a clear description of the reasonable cause to believe that a violation
of section 340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred, along with sufficient facts and evidence in support of the request.
In addition, the manufacturer shall provide copies of any documents supporting its claims. 

(c) The Office of Drug Pricing will conduct a preliminary review of the documentation submitted to determine if reasonable
cause exists. If the Office of Drug Pricing finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of section
340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred, the audit will be permitted, and the manufacturer will be notified accordingly.
In cases where the Office of Drug Pricing determines that the audit shall be performed by the Government, the Office
of Drug Pricing will so advise the manufacturer and the covered entity. 

(d) The filing of a request for an audit does not affect any statutory obligations of the parties as defined in section
340B of the PHS Act. During the audit process, a manufacturer must continue to sell covered outpatient drugs at or below
the section 340B ceiling price to the covered entity being audited. 

(e) Upon approval of the request for a covered entity audit, the manufacturer shall then submit an audit workplan to
the Office of Drug Pricing for approval. The Office of Drug Pricing, after consultation with the PHS Office of Cost
and Audit Management, will evaluate the manufacturer's workplan, and approval will be based on criteria set forth
in the Audit Program section, Field Work Standards for Performance Audits, Government Audit Standards, Current
Revision. The audit workplan shall describe in detail the following:




(1) Audit objectives (what the audit is to accomplish), scope (type of data to be reviewed, systems and procedures
to be examined, officials of the covered entity to be interviewed, and expected time frame for the audit), and methodology
(processes used to gather and analyze data and to provide evidence to reach conclusions and recommendations); 

(2) Skill and knowledge of the audit organization's personnel to staff the assignment, their supervision, and the
intended use of consultants, experts, and specialists; 

(3) Tests and procedures to be used to assess the covered entity's system of internal controls; 

(4) Procedures to be used to determine the amounts to be questioned should violations of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and
(B) be discovered; and 

(5) Procedures to be used to protect patient confidentiality.




(f) When the audit workplan has been approved, the Office of Drug Pricing shall notify the: (1) Manufacturer of the
approval of the audit, and (2) covered entity of a pending manufacturer audit. The covered entity will have at least
15 days from the date of receipt of the notice to prepare for the audit. 

(g) Suggested audit procedures include the following:




(1) Review the covered entity's policies and procedures regarding the procurement, inventory, distribution, dispensing,
and billing for covered outpatient drugs. 

(2) Assess internal controls applicable to the policies and procedures identified above (

#

1) when necessary to satisfy the audit objectives. 

(3) Review the covered entity's policies and procedures to prevent the resale or transfer of drugs to a person or persons
who are not patients of the covered entity. 

(4) Test compliance with the policies and procedures identified above (

#

3) when necessary to satisfy the audit objectives. 

(5) Review the covered entity's records of drug procurement and distribution and determine whether the covered entity
obtained a discount only for those programs authorized to receive discounts by section 340B of the PHS Act. 

(6) If a covered entity does not use an all inclusive billing system (per encounter or visit), but instead bills outpatient
drugs using a cost based billing system, determine whether the covered entity has provided its Medicaid provider
number to the Office of Drug Pricing and billed Medicaid at the actual acquisition cost.

<TEXT>
 

(h) Where the manufacturer's auditors conclude that there has been a violation of the requirements of section 340B(a)(5)
(A) or (B), the manufacturer's auditors shall identify (1) the procedures or lack of adherence to 
existing procedures which caused the violation, and (2) the dollar amounts involved. 

(i) Following completion of the audit field work, the manufacturer's auditors shall provide a verbal briefing of
the audit findings to the covered entity to ensure a full understanding of the facts. 

(j) An audit report must be prepared at the completion of the audit in accordance with reporting standards for performance
audits of the Government Auditing Standards, Current Revision. The manufacturer shall submit a copy of the audit
report to the covered entity. The covered entity shall provide its response to the manufacturer on the audit report's
findings and recommendations within 60 days from the date of receipt of the audit report. When the covered entity agrees
with the audit report's findings and recommendations either in full or in part, the covered entity shall include in
its response to the manufacturer a description of the actions planned or taken to address the audit findings and recommendations.
When the covered entity does not agree with the audit report's findings and recommendations, the covered entity shall
provide its rationale for the disagreement to the manufacturer. 

(k) Informational copies of the audit report shall also be submitted to the Office of Drug Pricing (see section 

For Further Information Contact

 for the address), the Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services, PHS Audits Division at room 1-30,
Park Building, 12420 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, MD 20857, and the PHS Cost and Audit Management Branch, room 17A-50,
Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. 

(l) If a dispute concerning the audit findings and recommendations arises, the parties may file a request for informal
dispute resolution with the Office of Drug Pricing. All dispute resolution procedures developed by the Office of
Drug Pricing shall be followed. 



Informal Dispute Resolution 


The Office of Drug Pricing is proposing an informal process for the resolution of certain disputes between manufacturers,
covered entities, and PHS concerning compliance with the provisions of section 340B of the PHS Act. PHS expects parties
to utilize this informal process before resorting to other remedies which may be available. 



I. Types of Disputes Covered 


Disputes resolved by these procedures include: 

(a) A manufacturer believes a covered entity is in violation of the prohibition against resale or transfer of a covered
outpatient drug provided in section 340B(a)(5)(B) of the PHS Act, or the prohibition against duplicate discounts
or rebates provided in section 340B(a)(5)(A) of the PHS Act; 

(b) A covered entity believes that a manufacturer is charging a price for a covered outpatient drug that exceeds the
ceiling price as determined by section 340B(a)(1) of the PHS Act; 

(c) A manufacturer is conditioning the sale of covered outpatient drugs to a covered entity on the entity's provision
of assurances or other compliance with the manufacturer's requirements that are based upon section 340B provisions;


(d) A manufacturer has refused to sell a covered outpatient drug to a covered entity at or below the ceiling price as
determined by section 340B(a)(1) of the PHS Act; 

(e) A manufacturer believes that a covered entity is dispensing a covered outpatient drug in an unauthorized service
(e.g., inpatient services or ineligible clinics within the same health system); 

(f) A manufacturer believes that a covered entity has not complied with the audit requirements under section 340B(a)(5)(C)
of the PHS Act, or the auditors of the manufacturer have not abided by the approved workplan or audit guidelines.

II. Review Process 



Prior to the filing of a request for review with the Office of Drug Pricing, the parties must attempt, in good faith,
to resolve the dispute. All parties involved in the dispute must maintain written documentation as evidence of a good
faith attempt to resolve the dispute. Such evidence includes documentation of meetings, letters, or telephone calls
between the disputing parties that concern the dispute. 

If the dispute has not been resolved after a good faith attempt, a party may submit a written request for a review of the
dispute to the Director of the Office of Drug Pricing. [See address in ``For Further Information Contact'' section].


The party requesting the review may not rely only upon allegations but is required to set forth specific facts showing
that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact in dispute that requires a review. 

The request for review shall include a clear description of the dispute, shall identify all the issues in the dispute,
and shall contain a full statement of the party's position with respect to such issue(s) and the pertinent facts and
reasons in support of the party's position. In addition to the required statement, the party shall provide copies
of any documents supporting its claim and evidence that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute. These materials
must be tabbed and organized chronologically and accompanied by an indexed list identifying each document. 

The filing of the dispute does not affect any statutory obligations of the parties as defined in section 340B of the
PHS Act. During the review process, for example, a manufacturer must continue to sell covered outpatient drugs at
or below the section 340B ceiling price to all covered entities, including the covered entity involved in the dispute.


The Director, Bureau of Primary Health Care, shall appoint a committee to review the documentation submitted by the
disputing parties and to make a proposed determination. A minimum of three individuals shall be appointed (one of
whom shall be designated as a chairperson) either on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis, or as regular members of the review
committee. The chairperson shall be from the Office of Drug Pricing and the committee members shall be from other sections
of PHS (e.g., chief pharmacist, auditor). 

Upon receipt of a request for a review, the chairperson of the review committee will send a letter to the party alleged
to have committed a violation. The letter will include (1) the name of the party making the allegation(s), (2) the allegation(s),
(3) documentation supporting the party's position, and (4) a request for a response to or rebuttal of the allegations
within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the letter. 7 days from the date of the postmark of the letter will be allowed
for mailing and processing through the organization. 

Upon receipt of the response or rebuttal, the review committee chairperson will review all documentation. The request
and rebuttal information will be reviewed for (1) evidence that a good faith effort was made to resolve the dispute,
(2) completeness, (3) adequate documentation supporting the issues, and (4) the reasonableness of the allegations.
If the documentation is adequate, the review committee will be convened to consider the matter. 

The reviewing committee may, at its discretion, invite parties to discuss the pertinent issues with the committee
and to submit such additional information as the committee deems appropriate. 

The reviewing committee will propose to dismiss the dispute, if it conclusively appears from the data, information,
and factual analyses contained in the request for a review and rebuttal documents that there is no genuine and substantial
issue of fact in dispute. This proposed finding of the committee will be submitted to the Director of the Office of Drug
Pricing for consideration and approval. A written decision of dismissal will be sent to each party and will contain
the Director's findings and conclusions in detail and reasons why the request for a review did not raise a genuine and
substantial issue of fact. 

With all other proposed findings, the review committee will prepare a written document containing the findings and
detailed reasons supporting the proposed decision. The document is to be signed by the chairperson and each of the
other committee members. The chairperson will submit the proposed findings to the Director of the Office of Drug Pricing
for consideration and approval. The Director's written decision will be sent with a transmittal letter to both parties.


If the covered entity or the manufacturer does not agree with the Office of Drug Pricing's determination, the covered
entity or the manufacturer may appeal within 30 days after receiving such a determination to the Administrator of
the Health Resources and Services Administration who will appoint a review official or committee. 



III. Penalties 



If the final determination is that a manufacturer has violated the provisions of section 340B of the PHS Act or the PHS
pharmaceutical pricing agreement, the manufacturer's agreement with PHS could be terminated or other actions taken
as deemed appropriate. If the final determination is that an entity has violated section 340B prohibitions against
resale or transfer of covered outpatient drugs, the prohibition against duplicate discounts and rebates (or billing
Medicaid more than the actual acquisition cost of the drug), or other statutory prohibitions, the entity shall be
liable to the manufacturer of the covered outpatient drug that is the subject of the violation in an amount equal to
the reduction in the price of the drug for the period of the violation, as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(D) of the PHS
Act. The entity may also be excluded from the drug discount program, if the conduct warrants such a sanction. 

After the dispute is resolved, any disputed amounts plus the rate of interest must be paid or credited to an account
balance no later than 30 days following a final determination. Interest will begin to accrue from the time the manufacturer
is deemed to have been out of compliance with section 340B (or provisions of the PHS Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement)
or the entity is deemed to have violated prohibitions of section 340B. The interest rate will be based upon an annual
rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury after considering private consumer rates of interest prevailing
at the time of the violation. This rate, utilized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the collection
of debts owed to the United States, may be revised quarterly by the Secretary of the Treasury and is published by the
HHS Assistant Secretary for Management and Budget in the 

Federal Register

. See 45 CFR 30.13 Parties will apply the interest rate for the quarter in which the violation occurred, and this rate
will remain fixed for the duration of the time in which interest accrues.




(The reporting requirements of this document are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) clearance under
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520, and will not be implemented until such clearance has
been obtained)

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in 

National Coalition for the Homeless 

v. 

Veterans Administration, 

No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.).



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.

Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.

For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available.

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number.

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Florida Panther Interagency Committee (FPIC), composed of representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service), National Park Service, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, and the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, approved the final Florida Panther Habitat Preservation Plan (Plan) January 3, 1994. The constituent
elements of the Plan include: (1) A characterization and identification of occupied and potential Florida panther
habitat (grouped into 11 ecological units) in 10 south Florida counties (Charlotte, Collier, Dade, DeSoto, Glades,
Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota); (2) identification of threats to occupied and potential Florida
panther habitat in south Florida, and (3) identification of 23 possible Florida panther habitat preservation options.
The overall goal of the Plan is to ensure a sustainable population of Florida panther in south Florida. 


The Plan is available in paper and electronic formats. Copies of the Plan can be obtained by making requests to the address(es)
below. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The following is a brief chronology and update on the Plan. A Habitat Preservation Working Group, comprised of U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, and Florida Department
of Environmental Protection, began drafting the Plan April 10, 1991. A 

Federal Register

 Notice announced the draft Plan was available for public review and comment on February 19, 1993. The Florida Panther
Technical Advisory Council reviewed the draft Plan on April 8, 1993, and provided technical comments under existing
Service policy regarding panther issues. The comment period closed on April 30, 1993. Thirty-one letters of support
and 33 letters of opposition to the draft Plan were received before the comment period closed. Three hundred and thirteen
letters of support and 96 letters of opposition were received after the comment period closed. All comments were taken
into consideration in subsequent revisions of the Plan. The Plan was approved by the FPIC on January 3, 1994. The FPIC
chairman and Technical Subcommittee members presented the final Plan to the public at a town meeting on February 3,
1994, in Ft. Myers, Florida, as requested by the Florida Farm Bureau. As of this date, approximately 900 copies of the
final Plan have been distributed. 


Copies of Plan, as well as a set of maps depicting more detailed information on areas of Panther habitat, have been deposited
at the main branch of each of the following county libraries: Charlotte, Collier, Dade, DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands,
Lee, Manatee, and Sarasota. Additional copies of the Plan are available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service free

<DOCTITLE>Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, OR; Environmental Statements</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on the proposed comprehensive
management plan for Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge, Lake County, Oregon, is available for public review.
Five alternatives are being considered, including the Preferred Alternative. This notice is being furnished pursuant
to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Service developed and analyzed five alternatives for the management of wildlife, habitat, and public use of Hart
Mountain National Antelope Refuge. The purpose of this FEIS is to recommend a course of action that would best guide
the management of the Refuge's resources.




The FEIS analyzes five alternative approaches to resolving the Refuge's core problems, which are: (1) Unnaturally
high densities of shrubs and junipers throughout Refuge uplands, and lack of periodic fire in these habitats; (2)
eroded stream channels and deficiency of riparain vegetation along a majority or Refuge streams; and (3) insufficient
resources and inadequate facilities to manage the increasing number of Refuge visitors. These problems are the underlying
factors currently preventing Refuge goals from being achieved, and thus provide a focal point for the proposed comprehensive
management plan. 

The five alternatives being considered are: (1) Baseline Management, which continues emphasis on a livestock grazing
program as the primary means of managing Refuge vegetation; (2) Featured Species Management, which combines the
uses of livestock grazing, prescribed burning and herbicides to manage vegetation; (3) Habitat Restoration Alternative,
which would emphasize restoration of Refuge habitats, although not to the extent proposed by the Ecosystem Management
Alternative; (4) Native Community Restoration (Preferred Alternative), which proposes an ecosystems management
approach to restoration of Refuge habitats and natural processes; and (5) Custodial Maintenance, which emphasizes
the total exclusion of human intervention. 



The Preferred Alternative, if implemented, would (1) reduce shrub and juniper cover on 22,000 to 40,000 acres within
15 years following implementation of the comprehensive management plan, primarily through prescribed burning;
(2) allow riparian areas to restore passively, except in limited areas where prescribed burning, willow plantings,
and check dams would be used; (3) discontinue the use of livestock on Refuge lands during the next 15 years; (4) redesign
one of the existing campgrounds and close the other; (5) create three additional camping areas as mitigation; (6)
maintain 162 miles of roads open to the public; (7) continue limited quality hunts for pronghorn, mule deer, and bighorn
sheep; and (8) recommend 80,541 acres for further study for potential wilderness designation, and 11,276 acres for
further study for potential Research Natural Areas designation. 

Copies of the FEIS may be viewed at the following locations:




U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Div. of Refuges & Wildlife, Third floor, 911 NE. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon

<DOCTITLE>Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China; Request for Comments Concerning the Institution of a Section 751(b)
Review Investigation </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States International Trade Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for comments regarding the institution of a section 751(b) review investigation concerning the Commission's
affirmative determination in investigation No. 731-TA-473 (Final), Certain Electric Fans from the
People's Republic of China (China). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission invites comments from the public on whether changed circumstances exist sufficient to warrant the
institution of an investigation pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)) (the Act)
to review the Commission's affirmative determination in the above investigation. The purpose of the proposed review
investigation is to determine whether an industry in the United States would be materially injured, or would be threatened
with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States would be materially retarded, by reason
of imports of ceiling fans from China if the existing antidumping order on such merchandise were to be modified or revoked.

1

 Ceiling fans are provided for in subheading 8414.51.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background


On October 25, 1991, the Department of Commerce gave notice that imports of certain electric fans (including ceiling
fans) from China were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of section 731
of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673) (an amendment to its determination, modifying the margins accorded to specific companies,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 9, 1991 (56 F.R. 64240)), and on December 2, 1991, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)
of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)(1)), that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason of imports
of ceiling fans.

2

 Commerce thereby ordered that dumping duties be imposed. On March 2, 1994, however, Commerce published in the 

Federal Register

 a revision to its original dumping determination, effectively excluding one of the Chinese producers from the order
and reducing the margin for non-specified firms (59 FR 9956). Consequently, on May 4, 1994, counsel for Encon Industries,
Inc., an importer of the subject merchandise, filed a request with the Commission to review its earlier affirmative
injury determination pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(b)). 




Written Comments Requested


Pursuant to section 207.45(b)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 207.45(b)(2)), the
Commission requests comments concerning whether the alleged changed circumstances, brought about by Commerce's
revision of its dumping order, are sufficient to warrant institution of a review investigation. 



Written Submissions


In accordance with section 201.8 of the Commission's rules (19 CFR 201.8), the signed original and 14 copies of all
written submissions must be filed with the Secretary to the Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436. All
comments must be filed no later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the Commission in confidence must request business
confidential treatment under section 201.6 of the Commission's rules (19 CFR 201.6). Such requests should be directed
to the Secretary to the Commission and must include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant
such treatment. Each sheet must be clearly marked at the top ``Confidential Business Information.'' The Commission
will either accept the submission in confidence or return it. All nonconfidential written submissions will be available
for public inspection in the Office of the Secretary. 
Copies of the request for review of the injury determination and any other documents in this matter are available for
public inspection during regular business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary to the Commission;
telephone 202-205-2000. 



Issued: June 7, 1994.

<USBUREAU>Drug Enforcement Administration</USBUREAU>


Village Drug Revocation of Registration



On March 18, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Village Drug (Respondent), of El Segundo, California, proposing to deny Respondent's
application for a DEA Certificate of Registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's
registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).

Specifically the Order to Show Cause alleged that: Respondent's pharmacy license as well as the pharmacist's license
of Bernard P. Kastigar (Mr. Kastigar), the owner/operator of Respondent, were suspended for thirty days and placed
on three years probation in 1985 by the Board of Pharmacy, Department of Consumer Affairs, State of California (Pharmacy
Board); in 1988, based upon violations of the Pharmacy Board's probation order, Mr. Kastigar's pharmacist license
was again suspended for thirty days and placed on probation for an additional three years; between 1991 and 1993, Mr.
Kastigar dispensed Percodan, a Schedule II controlled substance, and anabolic steroids, Schedule III controlled
substances, to several individuals without a valid physician's authorization; on October 21, 1993, Mr. Kastigar
pled guilty to and was convicted of one count of unlawfully furnishing a controlled substance, in the Municipal Court
for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California; and Mr. Kastigar materially falsified
an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration, submitted on June 4, 1993, by indicating on such application
that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration, when in fact Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration
had been surrendered on April 27, 1993, and by also indicating on the application that he had never had a state license
suspended or placed on probation, when in fact his pharmacist's license as well as Respondent's license had been suspended
and placed on probation by the Pharmacy Board.

The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 11301. 54(d)
and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.

In 1983, the Pharmacy Board filed an accusation against Respondent pharmacy and Mr. Kastigar alleging, 

inter alia

, that an audit revealed significant shortages for a number of controlled substances and that Mr. Kastigar filled
numerous controlled substance prescriptions issued under circumstances in which he knew or should have known that
such prescriptions were not issued for a legitimate medical reason. Based upon a consent decree, Respondent and Mr.
Kastigar admitted the allegations. Both agreed to a thirty day suspension and a three year probationary term, effective
June 28, 1985.

On October 20, 1987, the Pharmacy Board issued another accusation against Mr. Kastigar based upon allegations that
he dispensed propoxyphene, a Schedule IV controlled substance, to an individual without a valid physician's authorization.
Mr. Kastigar entered into a second consent decree with the Pharmacy Board. Again, he admitted to the accusations and
his pharmacist's license was suspended for another thirty days and placed on probation for another three years, effective
June 24, 1988.

Subsequent investigation by the California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement revealed that Mr. Kastigar dispensed
Percodan, a Schedule II controlled substance, and anabolic steroids, a Schedule III controlled substance, to several
individuals without a physician's authorization between January 1991 and April 1993. A search warrant was served
on Respondent pharmacy on March 25, 1993. Mr. Kastigar was interviewed at that time and admitted some of the allegations
concerning the unlawful dispensing of the Percodan and anabolic steroids.

On April 26, 1993, Mr. Kastigar was charged in the Municipal Court for the South Bay Judicial District, County of Los
Angeles, State of California, with eleven counts of the unlawful furnishing of controlled substances and two counts
of dispensing controlled substances without a medical purpose. On September 23, 1993, Mr. Kastigar entered into
a plea agreement whereby he agreed to plea no contest to one felony count of the unlawful furnishing of a controlled
substance and agreed to a sentence of three years probation. The conditions of the probation included, 

inter alia

, 250 hours of community service, a $15,000 fine, the surrender of his pharmacist's license and surrender of medicare
and medicaid privileges. On October 21, 1993, Mr. Kastigar entered the plea pursuant to the agreement and was convicted
and sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement.

Mr. Kastigar voluntarily surrendered Respondent pharmacy's previous DEA Certificate of Registration, AK2083119,
on April 27, 1993. On June 4, 1993, Mr. Kastigar submitted an application to obtain a new DEA Certificate of Registration
for Respondent pharmacy. On this application, he indicated that he had never surrendered a DEA Certificate of Registration.
He also indicated on this application that he never had a state professional license suspended or placed on probation,
notwithstanding that the California Pharmacy Board had taken action against both Respondent and its owner in 1985
and 1988, as noted above.

In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are
as follows:

(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00108 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.

(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances.

(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 

In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator
is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to
give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See 

David E. Trawick, D.D.S., 

Docket No. 88-69, 53 FR 5326 (1988).

In this proceeding factors one, two, three, and five apply. Factor one is applicable based upon the California Board
of Pharmacy's suspensions and probation terms imposed on the licenses of Respondent pharmacy and the pharmacist's
license of Mr. Kastigar in 1985 and 1988. Factor two applies because Respondent dispensed controlled substances
without a physician's authorization or for no legitimate medical reason on a number of occasions between 1983 and
1993. Factor three is applicable based upon the conviction of Mr. Kastigar in the Municipal Court for the South Bay
Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, of one count of unlawfully furnishing controlled
substances. Factor five applies because Mr. Kastigar made two material falsifications on the application he submitted
for a new DEA Certificate of Registration on June 4, 1993. 

No evidence of explanation or mitigating circumstances has been offered by Respondent. Therefore, the Deputy Administrator
concludes that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration must be denied. 

Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that the application executed by Village
Drug, on June 4, 1993, for a DEA Certificate or Registration as a retail pharmacy, be, and it hereby is, denied. This
order is effective June 10, 1994.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Ave, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Withdrawn General Wage Determination Decision



This is to advise all interested parties that the Department of Labor is withdrawing, from the date of this notice,
General Wage Determination Nos. VA940045 and VA940055 dated February 11, 1994.

Agencies with construction projects pending, to which these wage decisions would have been applicable, should utilize
Wage Decision VA940029. Contracts for which bids have been opened shall not be affected by this notice. Also, consistent
with 29 CFR 1.6(c)(2)(i)(A), when the opening of bids is less than ten (10) days from the date of this notice, this action
shall be effective unless the agency finds that there is insufficient time to notify bidders of the change and the finding
is documented in the contract file.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Labor.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Grant of individual exemptions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code).



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The aplicaitons have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department.

The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.



Statutory Findings



In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings:

(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible;

(b) They are in the interests of the plans and their participants and beneficiaries; and

(c) They are protective of the rights of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940;

(G) Fidelity will not charge any Plan affected by a cross-trade transaction any fee or commission for such transaction;

transaction. A triggering event is defined as:




(a) A change in the composition or weighting of the index underlying an Index Account; or 

(b) A change in the overall level of investment in an Index Account as a result of investments and withdrawals made on

of the six-year period.

(4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section (4) and notwithstanding any provisions of subsections
(a)(2) and (b) of section 504 of the Act, the records referred to in section (3) of this Part II are unconditionally available

(1) Any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department or the Internal Revenue Service,

(2) Any fiduciary of a Plan participating in an Index Account who has authority to acquire or dispose of the interests
of the Plan or any duly authorized employee or representative of such fiduciary,

(3) Any contributing employer to any Plan participating in an Index Account or any duly authorized employee or representative
of such employer, and

(4) Any participant or beneficiary of any Plan participating in an Index Account, or any duly authorized employee
or representative of such participant or beneficiary.




(b) None of the persons described in paragraphs (2) through (4) of subsection (a) of this section (4) shall be authorized
to examine trade secrets of Fidelity, any of its affiliates, or commercial or financial information which is privileged

<TEXT>
 

(1) An independent fiduciary of each Plan must specifically authorize each cross-trade transaction in accordance
with the following procedure:

(a) No more than three business days prior to the execution of any cross-trade transaction, Fidelity must inform an
independent fiduciary of each Plan involved in the cross-trade transaction that Fidelity proposes to buy or sell
specified securities in a cross-trade transaction if an appropriate opportunity is available, the current trading
price for such securities, and the total number of shares to be acquired or sold by each such Plan.

(b) Prior to each cross-trade transaction, the transaction must be authorized either orally or in writing by the independent
fiduciary of each Plan involved in the cross-trade transaction;

(c) If a cross-trade transaction is authorized orally by an independent fiduciary, Fidelity will provide written
confirmation of such authorization in a manner reasonably calculated to be received by such independent fiduciary
within one business day from the date of such authorization;

(d) The authorization referred to in this Part II(B) will be effective for a period of three business days; and

(e) No more than ten days after the completion of a cross-trade transaction, the independent fiduciary authorizing
the cross-trade transaction must be provided a written confirmation of the transaction and the price at which the
transaction was executed;

(2) A cross-trade transaction will be effected only where the transaction involves less than five percent of the aggregate
average daily trading volume for the securities involved in the transaction for the week immediately preceding the
authorization of the transaction. A cross-trade transaction may exceed this limit only by express authorization
of independent fiduciaries on behalf of Plans affected by the transaction; and

(3) The cross-trade transaction is effected at a price which is within ten percent of the closing price of the security
on the day before the date on which Fidelity receives authorization by the independent Plan fiduciary to engage in
the cross-trade transaction.



Part III_Definitions



(A) ``Account'' means an account holding assets of one or more employee benefit plans which are subject to the Act (the
Plans), for which Fidelity or an affiliate of Fidelity acts as a fiduciary;

(B) ``Affiliate'' means any person, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with Fidelity;

(C) ``Cross-trade transaction'' means a purchase and sale of securities between ERISA Accounts or between an ERISA
Account and a non-ERISA account for which Fidelity or an affiliate of Fidelity acts as a trustee or investment manager;

(D) ``Index Account'' means an Account for which Fidelity and the Plan sponsor or other named fiduciary have agreed
that the investment of the assets in question will be designed to replicate the capitalization-weighted composition
of a stock or bond index; and

(E) ``Managed Account'' means an Account for which Fidelity and the Plan sponsor or other named fiduciary have agreed
that the investment of the assets in question will be managed actively at the discretion of Fidelity, pursuant to written
guidelines as to which types of securities to buy or sell for the Account.

Written Comments: The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The comment was submitted
by the applicant, Fidelity Management Trust Company. The applicant addresses two matters which are summarized as
follows:


(1) The applicant notes a typographical error in Part III of the proposed exemption: Within the definition of ``Cross-trade
transaction'', the word ``account'' should not be capitalized. The applicant represents that, as described elsewhere
in the Notice of Proposed Exemption, cross-trade transactions covered by the proposed exemption may occur between
an account holding assets of one or more employee benefit plans which are subject to the Act (``Account'') and a non-ERISA
account managed by the applicant or an affiliate (``account'').

(2) The applicant wishes to supplement the summary of facts and representations of the notice of proposed exemption
(the Summary), by clarifying and revising its explanation of the manner in which opportunities for cross-trading
transactions are allocated among accounts under its management, which is found in section 10 of the Summary. The applicant
represents that subsequent to the publication of the Summary, it determined that its cross-trading program will
be effected pursuant to a non-discretionary pro-rata allocation system. For example, in the event that the number
of shares of a particular security which an Account proposes to sell on a given day is less than the number of shares of
such security which other Fidelity-advised accounts propose to buy on that date, the direct cross-trade opportunity
will be allocated among potential buyers on a pro-rata basis. A similar procedure would apply where the number of shares
of a particular security to be sold by Fidelity-advised accounts is less than the number of such shares which an Account
and one or more other Fidelity-advised accounts proposes to buy on that date. Thus, the Accounts participating in
Fidelity's cross-trade program will have opportunities to participate on a proportional basis in all cross-trade
transactions during the operation of the cross-trade program. The applicant represents that this aspect of Fidelity's
cross-trading program is among the information which will be disclosed in writing to the fiduciaries of the pension
plans which invest in the Accounts.

After careful consideration of the entire record, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as supplemented
by the applicant's comment.

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on December 10, 1993 at 58 FR 64978.

(1) LSI informed the Department that the Bankruptcy Court had entered an order on March 31, 1994, that approved the
$6 million dollar payment by LSI to the Master Trust. Subsequently, the Department was informed that on April 14, 1994,
LSI emerged from bankruptcy protection and that in connection with such emergence, LSI made the $6 million payment
to the Master Trust that is a condition, as set forth in Section II(c), of this exemption. In this regard, such condition
provides that LSI pay ``* * * the $6,000,000 in a single lump-sum payment in cash to the Master
Trust, not later than sixty (60) days following the later of (1) the date of the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving
the payment, or (2) the date the grant of this exemption is published in the 

Federal Register

.'' In the opinion of LSI, since the condition of the exemption states that the payment be made no later than a specified
date, that LSI's payment of the $6 million dollars before the publication of the final exemption complies with the
condition for grant of the exemption. The Department agrees with the position as expressed by LSI;

(2) LSI commented on the language concerning the condition of the exemption, as set forth in Section II(g), which states
that ``the terms of the Lease, as modified by the First Amendment, are at least as favorable to the Master Trust, the
Plans, and their participants and beneficiaries, as those which could have been obtained by the Master Trust in an
arm's length negotiations with an unrelated third party under similar circumstances.'' With respect to the language
in this sentence from Section II(g), the Department wishes to correct a typographical error in that the word, ``negotiations,''
written in the plural should read ``negotiation,'' in the singular. Accordingly, the Department has made this change
in the language of Section II(g) in the granted exemption.

Further in the language quoted in the paragraph above from Section II(g), LSI points out that the I/F's opinion regarding
the transaction, including the Lease of the Property, is that the overall transaction, taking into account all of
its provisions including the $6 million dollar payment, is equal to or superior to transactions that could be negotiated
with unrelated third parties. To the extent the inclusion of the language in Section II(g) referring to ``under similar
circumstances'' is intended to include the other term of the overall transaction, LSI states that the condition is
accurate as it relates to opinions provided by the I/F. The Department concurs with LSI's position;

(3) LSI requested modification of the language in Section II(k) which provides, in part that, ``LSI has either paid
directly or reimbursed the Master Trust for any fees, other than trustee and investment management fees, incurred
with respect to the ownership of the Property by the Master Trust.'' In the opinion of LSI the quoted language in the
sentence above implies that the Master Trust has paid no fees in connection with ownership of the Property other than
trustee or investment manager fees. LSI believes that this language is over broad, because it is not limited to those
fees incurred in connection with the transactions. For this reason, LSI suggests adding after the word, ``incurred,''
the phrase, ``in connection with the transactions.'' The Department has no objection to LSI's proposed modification,
and accordingly, has amended the language of Section II(k);

(4) LSI proposes clarification of the language of Section II(l) which states that ``LSI has filed Forms 5330 and paid
the excise taxes with respect to the Lease of the Property for the years 1987-1989 and will file Forms 5330 and
pay the excise taxes for the period after December 31, 1989, and before the effective date of this exemption.'' Because
the effective date of this exemption is September 10, 1990, LSI believes that this provision should be revised to clarify
that the excise taxes for the period after December 31, 1989, must be paid within sixty (60) days of the date the grant
of this exemption is published in the 

Federal Register

. For this reason, LSI suggests adding before the words, ``will file,'' the phrase, ``LSI not later than sixty (60)
days after the date the grant of this exemption is published in the 

Federal Register

.'' The Department has no objection to LSI's proposed modification, and accordingly, has amended the language of
Section II(l);

(5) LSI requests modification of the language in the third sentence of paragraph number one in the Summary of Facts
and Representations in the Notice which states that, ``In addition, LSI is a major source of ready-mixed concrete
and precast concrete products and is a leading importer of cement and clinker.'' In this regard, LSI has brought to
the Department's attention a more current description of LSI's business. Accordingly, LSI requests that the sentence
be amended to read ``In addition, LSI is a leading producer of cement, ready-mixed concrete, sand and gravel, crushed
stone, and construction materials.'' The Department has made the requested change to the description of LSI; and

(6) LSI requests modification of the representation in the fourth sentence in the fourth full paragraph of paragraph
number six of the Summary of Facts and Representations which states that, ``It is represented that the royalty payments
actually made by RMC have exceeded the minimum guaranteed royalty amounts for the years 1989 through 1992.'' In this
regard, LSI has informed the Department that the date 1992 should be corrected to read 1991. The Department has made
this change as requested by LSI.

As the Department concurs with the requested the modifications and clarifications to the language of the proposed
exemption, such changes are hereby incorporated into the exemption, as granted. Accordingly, after giving full
consideration to the record, including the comments by interested persons and the responses of the applicant, the
Department has determined to grant the exemption, as described herein. In this regard, the comments submitted to
the Department have been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete application
file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public inspection
in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, room N-5507, U.S. Department
of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption refer to the Notice published on March 8, 1994, 59 FR 10832.

qualified appraiser selected by the Plans' fiduciaries.

(e) In instances involving the acquisition of the Properties by a Company from a third party with a simultaneous sale

selected by the Plans' fiduciaries.

(h) All other terms of each such transaction are not less favorable to the Plans than the terms generally available
in an arm's-length transaction between unrelated parties.

three percent (3%) of such Plan's total assets as of the date of approval of each transaction by the PIC or GMIMCo.

(b) The term ``affiliate'' of a Company means any entity directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries,
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Company.
(c) The term ``control,'' for purposes of the above definition, means the power to exercise a controlling influence
over the management or policies of an entity.
(d) The term ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' means a fiduciary as defined in section 3(21) of the Act which:
(i) Is independent of and unrelated to any of the Companies and their affiliates (as defined above); (ii) is a financial
institution or business organization that in the normal course of business advises institutional investors regarding
oil and gas investments; (iii) acknowledges in writing to the Plans that is will manage specific oil and gas investments
on behalf of the Plans, in its capacity as a fiduciary of the Plans, as designated by the PIC or GMIMCo; and (iv) satisfies
the definition of ``qualified professional asset manager'' (QPAM) under Section V(a) of Prohibited Transaction
Exemption 84-14 (PTE 84-14, 49 FR 9494, March 13, 1984), except for the fact that either the PIC or GMIMCo
retains final approval authority for all oil and gas investments recommended by such fiduciary.
(e) The term ``Property'' or ``Properties'' means any oil and gas properties such as long-term leasehold interests
in oil and gas producing fields and the oil and gas in place on the properties. Such ``Property'' may include an interest
in the oil and gas wells, platforms, wellheads, piping, as well as the gas gathering system or processing facility
through which gas produced from the wells is either transported to the gas pipeline for shipment to various end users
or treated before delivery to the end users.
For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on December 29, 1993 at 58 FR 68958.

(b) The Company's annual report provided to the Plans containing detailed information on the Company's activities
with respect to the Properties during the preceding year is not ``audited'' by the ``qualified oil and gas investment
manager'' each year, but is ``audited'' at intervals recommended by the investment manager and authorized by GMIMCo.
However, the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager'' will review the information throughout the year for problems
or mistakes which will be corrected by the Company.
Paragraph 10 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the fact that, as previously noted, the Company may receive
additional compensation for operating the Properties in the form of operating fees pursuant to an Operating Agreement
and may recoup certain general or administrative expenses as permitted by the Conveyance.
Paragraph 12 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the fact that GMIMCo has appointed other ``qualified oil
and gas investment managers'' for the Plans, in addition to RPI Institutional Services, Inc., and such managers have
met all the requirements of Section III(d) of the Proposal.
Paragraph 14 of the Summary should be clarified to reflect the correct NPI sharing percentages of the May 8, 1990 NPI
transaction with Callon Offshore Production Inc. (Callon). The applicant states that although the Plans did in fact
pay 98% of the $28 million purchase price, the Plans received a 98% NPI in the Properties which will continue until the
Plans recoup their entire share of the purchase price. After the Plans receive their entire investment in the NPI acquisition,
there will be a reversion to an 88% NPI for the Plans at that point in time. The applicant believes that this clarification
is important because the Plans will receive all of their investment in the Properties before Callon is able to collect
from its additional NPI percentage.
The Department also received eleven comment letters from participants in the Plans regarding the Proposal. Two of
the commenters were opposed to the granting of the exemption. One of these commenters was concerned that the oil and
gas transactions are risky investments for the Plans and that any appraisal of such assets by the Plans may be overvalued.
The other commenter stated that he was opposed to the exemption because GMC may either knowingly or unknowingly exercise
a controlling influence over various oil and gas suppliers when it buys oil and gas to meet its own energy needs and that
such influence may be to the detriment of the Plans' oil and gas investments. This commenter also stated that GMC's
oil and gas purchasing power could be used to affect certain local markets. Many of the Commenters stated that they
supported the granting of the exemption, but only if GMC offers an ``early retirement package'' to all salaried employees,
regardless of job classification, that meet certain age and service criteria. Some of these commenters noted that
notices regarding the Proposal were posted late and that interested persons were not given enough time to reply.
By letter dated March 18, 1994, the applicant responded to these comments.
First, with respect to the comment that oil and gas transactions are risky investments for the Plans and that appraisals
of such assets may be overvalued, the applicant states that the subject transactions under the terms and conditions
described in the Proposal are in the best interests of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries. The applicant
represents that oil and gas investments can be reasonable and appropriate for a large pension plan, such as the Plans,
and that the subject transactions have been and will continue to be carefully monitored by GMIMCo. The oil and gas transactions
by the Plans under the requested exemption will represent only a small percentage of each Plan's total assets (see
Section II(i) above) and the existing investments have yielded the Plans a high rate of return (see Paragraph 11 of
the Summary). The applicant states that any activity by GMIMCo or the ``qualified oil and gas investment manager''
acting for the Plans that is outside the scope of activity described to the Department in the Proposal, including any
methods for overvaluing the fair market value of proposed or existing oil and gas assets of the Plans, would be a breach
of fiduciary duty in violation of the Act. In addition, such activity would be outside the scope of the conditions of
the Proposal and would not be subject to the prohibited transaction relief which would be afforded by the exemption.
Second, regarding the comment that GMC may exercise a controlling influence over various oil and gas suppliers when
GMC buys oil and gas to meet its own energy needs and that such influence may be to the detriment of the Plans' oil and gas
investments, the applicant states that the comment is without merit and is inconsistent with the facts and representations
contained in the Proposal. The applicant maintains that GMC has a de minimus involvement with any oil and gas suppliers
when acquiring oil and gas to run its own operations. With respect to GMC's relationship to any such suppliers in the
subject oil and gas transactions by the Plans, the applicant states that the definition of ``Company'' in Section
III(a) of the Proposal excludes any operating company or partnership which is related to GMC or its affiliates. In
addition, the oil and gas investments covered by the Proposal involve the Plans' in a passive investment role, with
very limited control over the actual sale or distribution of oil and gas obtained from the Properties.

Third, with respect to whether notification of interested persons was adequate and timely, the applicant states
that all notices, together with copies of the Proposal as published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 29, 1993, were posted and distributed by GMC in all primary business locations on or prior to January 28,
1994. In addition, each of the appropriate unions received copies of the notices and the Proposal. These notices,
a copy of which has been submitted to the Department by the applicant, informed interested persons of their right to
comment on the Proposal in writing to the Department on or before February 28, 1994. An authorized representative
of GMC has provided the Department with a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to the truth of the information
regarding GMC's notice to interested persons as required by the Department's regulations (see 29 CFR 2570.43). Thus,
the applicant represents that GMC has complied with the Department's exemption procedures regarding notification
of interested persons in the manner agreed to between the applicant and the Department.

Fourth, with respect to comments which linked the Proposal to GMC providing an early retirement benefits package
to its employees, the applicant states that matters concerning the eligibility of Plan participants to certain benefits
are totally unrelated to the Proposal. Since the Proposal only involves investing assets of the Plans in specific
oil and gas investments and has nothing to do with any early retirement benefits for GMC employees, the applicant requests
that the Department not link the granting of an exemption to any requirement that GMC provide early retirement benefits
for its employees.

The Department agrees with the applicant that the merits of granting an exemption for the subject oil and gas investments
by the Plans should be judged independent of any decisions by GMC regarding the eligibility of participants to certain
benefits under the terms of the Plans. In addition, the Department believes that the applicant has adequately addressed
all of the issues raised by the commenters and that the subject oil and gas transactions, under the terms and conditions
described herein, are in the interests and protective of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries.

Accordingly, after consideration of the entire record, the Department has determined to grant the exemption as modified.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 

(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately described all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

NatWest Securities Corporation, Inc. (NatWest) Located in New York, New York


[Application No. D-9681]


Proposed Exemption


I. Transactions


A. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section
4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Code shall not apply to the following
transactions involving trusts and certificates evidencing interests therein:
(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and an employee benefit plan when the sponsor, servicer, trustee or insurer of a trust,
the underwriter of the certificates representing an interest in the trust, or an obligor is a party in interest with
respect to such plan;
(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates;
and
(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.A.(1) or (2).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.A. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(E),
406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate on behalf of an Excluded Plan by any person who has
discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of that Excluded Plan.





B. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(b)(1) and 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed
by section 4975(a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(E) of the Code shall not apply to:
(1) The direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of certificates in the initial issuance of certificates between
the sponsor or underwriter and a plan when the person who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the investment of plan assets in the certificates is (a) an obligor with respect to 5 percent or less
of the fair market value of obligations or receivables contained in the trust, or (b) an affiliate of a person described
in (a); if:
(i) The plan is not an Excluded Plan;
(ii) solely in the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initial issuance of the certificates,
at least 50 percent of each class of certificates in which plans have invested is acquired by persons independent of
the members of the Restricted Group and at least 50 percent of the aggregate interest in the trust is acquired by persons
independent of the Restricted Group;
(iii) A plan's investment in each class of certificates does not exceed 25 percent of all of the certificates of that
class outstanding at the time of the acquisition; and
(iv) Immediately after the acquisition of the certificates, no more than 25 percent of the assets of a plan with respect
to which the person has discretionary authority or renders investment advice are invested in certificates representing
an interest in a trust containing assets sold or serviced by the same entity.
 For purposes of this paragraph B.(1)(iv) only, an entity will not be considered to service assets contained in a trust
if it is merely a subservicer of that trust;




(2) The direct or indirect acquisition or disposition of certificates by a plan in the secondary market for such certificates,

(3) The continued holding of certificates acquired by a plan pursuant to subsection I.B.(1) or (2).

C. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed
by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code, shall not apply to transactions in connection
with the servicing, management and operation of a trust; provided:

(1) Such transactions are carried out in accordance with the terms of a binding pooling and servicing arrangement;
and

(2) The pooling and servicing agreement is provided to, or described in all material respects in the prospectus or
private placement memorandum provided to, investing plans before they purchase certificates issued by the trust.







Notwithstanding the foregoing, section I.C. does not provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(b)
of the Act or from the taxes imposed by reason of section 4975(c) of the Code for the receipt of a fee by a servicer of the
trust from a person other than the trustee or sponsor, unless such fee constitutes a ``qualified administrative fee''
as defined in section III.S.



D. Effective December 22, 1993, the restrictions of sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act, and the taxes imposed by
sections 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of sections 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to
any transactions to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be
a party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services
to the plan (or by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H)
or (I) of the Act or section 4975(e)(2) (F), (G), (H) or (I) of the Code), solely because of the plan's ownership of certificates.



II. General Conditions



A. The relief provided under part I is available only if the following conditions are met:

(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party;

(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust;

(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard & Poor's Corporation (S&P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff & Phelps Inc. (D&P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch);

(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer;

(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and

(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation
D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933.

B. Neither any underwriter, placement agent, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any
of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by
a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6)
above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such
condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement
of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance
with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial
purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee
a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required to make
a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above.



III. Definitions



For purposes of this exemption:

A. 

Certificate

 means:

(1) A certificate

(a) That represents a beneficial ownership interest in the assets of a trust; and

(b) That entitles the holder to pass-through payments of principal, interest, and/or other payments made with respect
to the assets of such trust; or

or any of its affiliates which is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States courts is either (i) the sole underwriter
or the manager or co-manager of the underwriting syndicate, or (ii) a selling or placement agent. For purposes of this
exemption, references to ``certificates representing an interest in a trust'' include certificates denominated
as debt which are issued by a trust.

B. 

Trust

 means an investment pool, the corpus of which is held in trust in the United States and consists solely of:

(1) Either

(a) Secured consumer receivables that bear interest or are purchased at a discount (including, but not limited to,
home equity loans and obligations secured by shares issued by a cooperative housing association);

(b) Secured credit instruments that bear interest or are purchased at a discount in transactions by or between business
entities (including, but not limited to, qualified equipment notes secured by leases, as defined in section III.T);

(c) Obligations that bear interest or are purchased at a discount and which are secured by single-family residential,
multi-family residential and commercial real property, (including obligations secured by leasehold interests
on commercial real property);

(d) Obligations that bear interest or are purchased at a discount and which are secured by motor vehicles or equipment,
or qualified motor vehicle leases (as defined in section III.U);

(e) ``Guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificates,'' as defined in 29 CFR 2510.3-101(i)(2);

(f) Fractional undivided interests in any of the obligations described in clauses (a)-(e) of this section B.(1);

(2) Property which had secured any of the obligations described in subsection B.(1);

(3) Undistributed cash or temporary investments made therewith maturing no later than the next date on which distributions
are to be made to certificateholders; and

(4) rights of the trustee under the pooling and servicing agreement, and rights under any insurance policies, third-party
guarantees, contracts of suretyship and other credit support arrangements with respect to any obligations described
in subsection B.(1).




Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term ``trust'' does not include any investment pool unless: (1) The investment
pool consists only of assets of the type which have been included in other investment pools, (ii) certificates evidencing
interests in such other investment pools have been rated in one of the three highest generic rating categories by S&P's,
Moody's, D&P, or Fitch for at least one year prior to the plan's acquisition of certificates pursuant to this exemption.



C. 

Underwriter

 means:

(1) NatWest;

(2) Any person directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by or under common

or co-manager with respect to the certificates.

D. 

Sponsor

 means the entity that organizes a trust by depositing obligations therein in exchange for certificates.

means the entity that is a party to the pooling and servicing agreement relating to trust assets and is fully responsible
for servicing, directly or through subservicers, the assets of the trust.
F. 

Subservicer 

means an entity which, under the supervision of and on behalf of the master servicer, services receivables contained
in the trust, but is not a party to the pooling and servicing agreement.
G. 

Servicer 

means any entity which services receivables contained in the trust, including the master servicer and any subservicer.

Trustee 

means the trustee of the trust, and in the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, also means
the trustee of the indenture trust.
I. 

Insurer 

means the insurer or guarantor of, or provider of other credit support for, a trust.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person is not an insurer solely because it holds securities representing an interest
in a trust which are of a class subordinated to certificates representing an interest in the same trust.


J. 

Obligor 

means any person, other than the insurer, that is obligated to make payments with respect to any obligation or receivable
included in the trust. Where a trust contains qualified motor vehicle leases or qualified equipment notes secured

shall also include any owner of property subject to any lease included in the trust, or subject to any lease securing
an obligation included in the trust.
K. 

Excluded Plan 

means any plan with respect to which any member of the Restricted Group is a ``plan sponsor'' within the meaning of section
3(16)(B) of the Act.
L. 

Restricted Group 

with respect to a class of certificates means:
(1) Each underwriter;
(2) Each insurer;
(3) The sponsor;

Trust Assets


2. NatWest seeks exemptive relief to permit plans to invest in pass-through certificates representing undivided
interests in the following categories of trusts: (1) Single and multi-family residential or commercial mortgage
investment trusts;
 (2) motor vehicle receivable investment trusts; (3) consumer or commercial receivables investment trusts; and
(4) guaranteed governmental mortgage pool certificate investment trusts.






3. Commercial mortgage investment trusts may include mortgages on ground leases or real property. Commercial mortgages
are frequently secured by ground leases on the underlying property, rather than by fee simple interests. The separation
of the fee simple interest and the ground lease interest is generally done for tax reasons. Properly structured, the
pledge of the ground lease to secure a mortgage provides a lender with the same level of security as would be provided
by a pledge of the related fee simple interest. The terms of the ground leases pledged to secure leasehold mortgages
will in all cases be at least ten years longer than the term of such mortgages.





Trust Structure


4. Each trust is established under a pooling and servicing agreement between a sponsor, a servicer and a trustee. The
sponsor or servicer of a trust selects assets to be included in the trust. These assets are receivables which may have
been originated, in the ordinary course of business, by a sponsor or servicer of the trust, an affiliate of the sponsor
or servicer, or by an unrelated lender and subsequently acquired by the trust sponsor or servicer.
On or prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust, establishes
the trust and designates an independent entity as trustee. On the closing date, the sponsor conveys to the trust legal
title to the assets, and the trustee issues certificates representing fractional undivided interests in the trust
assets. NatWest, or one or more broker-dealers (which may include NatWest), acts (or may act in the future) as underwriter
or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates. In addition, NatWest anticipates privately placing
certificates on both a firm commitment and an agency basis.
Certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly, quarterly or semi-annually installments of principal and/or
interest, or lease payments due on the receivables, adjusted, in the case of payments of interest, to a specified rate_the
pass-through rate_which may be fixed or variable.
When installments or payments are made on a semi-annual basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer's
assets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in the name
of the trustee (on behalf of certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates. The account
is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities which have received
a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make
a single deposit into the account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from
obligors by the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event
will the period of time between the receipt of funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated account
exceed 45 days. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer will furnish
a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this report is delivered
to the trustee, it will be made available to certificateholders and delivered to or made available to each rating agency
that has rated the certificates.
5. Some of the certificates will be multi-class certificates. NatWest requests exemptive relief for two types of
multi-class certificates: ``Strip'' certificates and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates. Strip certificates
are a type of security in which the stream of interest payments on receivables is split from the flow of principal payments
and separate classes of certificates are established, each representing rights to disproportionate payments of
principal and interest.






``Fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates involve the issuance of classes of certificates having different stated maturities
or the same maturities with different payment schedules. Interest and/or principal payments received on the underlying
receivables are distributed first to the class of certificates having the earliest stated maturity of principal
and/or earlier payment schedule, and only when that class of certificates has been paid in full (or has received a specified
amount) will distributions be made with respect to the second class of certificates. Distributions on certificates
having later stated maturities will proceed in like manner until all the certificateholders have been paid in full.
The only difference between this multi-class pass-through arrangement and a single-class pass-through arrangement
is the order in which distributions are made to certificateholders. In each case, certificateholders will have a
beneficial ownership interest in the underlying assets. In neither case will the rights of a plan purchasing certificates
be subordinated to the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on any of the underlying obligations.
In particular, if the amount available for distribution to certificateholders is less than the amount required to
be so distributed, all senior certificateholders will share in the amount distributed on pro rata basis.

6. For tax reasons, the trust must be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion
and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing
agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation
discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates (within 120 days, except in the case of obligations
having an original term of 30 years, in which case the period will not exceed two years). Any receivable so substituted
is required to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy
as the replaced receivable.

In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected
receivable and passed through to certificateholders.



Parties to Transactions



7. The 

originator

 of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile
purchaser, or leases property to a lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell it
to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor.

Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course
of their business, including finance companies, for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations,
financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind
of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations.
Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the
trust sponsor or servicer.

8. The 

sponsor

 will be one of three entities: (i) A special-purpose or other corporation unaffiliated with the servicer, (ii) a special-purpose
or other corporation affiliated with the servicer, or (iii) the servicer itself. Where the sponsor is not also the
servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing
the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables to the trust.

9. The 

trustee

 of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents
and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in
favor of certificateholders.

The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to NatWest, the trust sponsor or the servicer.
NatWest represents that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in
trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the sponsor or servicer. The method
of compensating the trustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosed in the prospectus
or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.

10. The 

servicer 

of a trust administers the receivables on behalf of the certificateholders. The servicer's functions typically
involve, among other things, notifying borrowers of amounts due on receivables, maintaining records of payments
received on receivables and instituting foreclosure or similar proceedings in the event of default. In cases where
a pool of receivables has been purchased from a number of different originators and deposited in a trust, it is common
for the receivables to be ``subserviced'' by their respective originators and for a single entity to ``master service''
the pool of receivables on behalf of the owners of the related series of certificates. Where this arrangement is adopted,
a receivable continues to be serviced from the perspective of the borrower by the local subservicer, while the investor's
perspective is that the entire pool of receivables is serviced by a single, central master servicer who collects payments
from the local subservicers and passes them through to certificateholders.


Receivables of the type suitable for inclusion in a trust invariably are serviced with the assistance of a computer.
After the sale, the servicer keeps the sold receivables on the computer system in order to continue monitoring the
accounts. Although the records relating to sold receivables are kept in the same master file as receivables retrained
by the originator, the sold receivables are flagged as having been sold. To protect the investors' interest, the servicer
ordinarily covenants that this ``sold flag'' will be included in all records relating to the sold receivables, including
the master file, archives, tape extracts, and printouts.

The sold flags are invisible to the obligor, and do not affect the manner in which the servicer performs the billing,
posting and collection procedures relating to the sold receivables. However, the servicer uses the sold flag to identify
the receivables for the purpose of reporting all activity on those receivables after their sale to the investors.




Depending on the type of receivable and the details of the servicer's computer system, in some cases the servicer's
internal reports can be adapted for investor reporting with little or no modification. In other cases, the servicer
may have to perform special calculations to fulfill the investor reporting responsibilities. These calculations
can be performed on the servicer's main computer, or on a small computer with data supplied by the main system. In all
cases, the numbers produced for the investors are reconciled to the servicer's books and reviewed by public accountants.




The 

underwriter 

will be registered broker-dealer that acts as underwriter or placement agent with respect to the sale of the certificates.
Public offerings of certificates are generally made on a firm commitment or agency basis. Private placements of certificates
may be made on a firm commitment or agency basis. 

It is anticipated that the lead or co-managing underwriter will make a market in certificates offered to the public.

In some cases, the originator and servicer of receivables to be included in a trust and the sponsor of the trust (though
they themselves may be related) will be unrelated to NatWest. In other cases, however, NatWest (directly or through
one or more of its U.S. banking affiliates) may originate or service receivables included in a trust, or may sponsor
a trust.







Certificate Price, Pass-Through Rate and Fees





11. In some cases, the sponsor will obtain the receivables from various originators pursuant to existing contracts
with such originators under which the sponsor will purchase the receivables at fair market value from originator
or a finance company pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement related to the specific offering of certificates. In
other cases, the sponsor will originate the receivables itself.




As compensation for the receivables transferred to the trust, the sponsor receives cash, or certificates representing
the entire beneficial interest in the trust. The sponsor sells some or all of these certificates for cash to investors
or securities underwriters.




12. The price of the certificates, both in the initial offering and in the secondary market, is affected by market forces
including investor demand, the pass-through interest rate on the certificates in relation to the rate payable on
investments of similar types and quality, expectations as to the effect on yield resulting from prepayment of underlying
receivables, and expectations as to the likelihood of timely payment.



The pass-through rate for certificates is equal to the interest rate on receivables included in the trust minus a specified
servicing fee.
 This rate is generally determined by the same market forces that determine the price of a certificate. The price of
a certificate and its pass-through, or coupon rate, together determine the yield to investors. If an investor purchases
a certificate at less than par, that discount augments the stated pass-through rate; conversely, a certificate purchased
at a premium yields less than the stated coupon.






13. As compensation for performing its servicing duties, the servicer (who may also be the sponsor or an affiliate
thereof, and receive fees for acting as sponsor) will retain the difference between payments received on the receivables
in the trust and payments payable (at the pass-through rate) to certificateholders, except that in some cases a portion
of the payments on receivables may be paid to a third party, such as a fee paid to a provider of credit support. The servicer
may receive additional compensation by having the use of the amounts paid on the receivables between the time they
are received by the servicer and the time they are due to the trust (which time is set forth in the pooling and servicing
agreement). The servicer, typically will be required to pay the administrative expenses of servicing the trust,
including in some cases the trustee's fee, out of its servicing compensation.

<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00135 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The servicer is also compensated to the extent it may provide credit enhancement to the trust or otherwise arrange
to obtain credit support from another party. This ``credit support fee'' may be aggregated with other servicing fees,
and is either paid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established, or out of the interest income received on the receivables
in excess of the pass-through rate.

14. The servicer may be entitled to retain certain administrative fees paid by a third party usually the obligor. These
administrative fees fall into three categories: (a) prepayment fees; (b) late payment and payment extension fees;
and (c) expenses, fees and charges associated with foreclosure or repossession, or other conversion of a secured
position into cash proceeds, upon default of an obligation.

Compensation payable to the servicer will be set forth or referred to in the pooling and servicing agreement and described
in reasonable detail in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the certificates.

15. Payments on receivables may be made by obligors to the servicer at various times during the period preceding any
date on which pass-through payments to the trust are due. In some cases, the pooling and servicing agreement may permit
the servicer to place these payments in non-interest bearing accounts in itself or to commingle such payments with
its own funds prior to the distribution dates. In these cases, the servicer would be entitled to the benefit derived
from the use of the funds between the date of payment on a receivable and the pass-through date. Commingled payments
may not be protected from the creditors of the servicer in the event of the servicer's bankruptcy or receivership.
In those instances when payments on receivables are held in non-interest bearing accounts or are commingled with
the servicer's own funds, the servicer is required to deposit these payments by a data specified in the pooling and
servicing agreement into an account from which the trustee makes payments to certificateholders.

16. The underwriter will receive a fee in connection with the securities underwriting or private placement of certificates.
In a fir commitment underwriting this fee would consist of the difference between what the underwriter receives for
the certificates that it distributes and what it pays the sponsor for those certificates. In a private placement,
the fee normally takes the form of an agency commission paid by the sponsor. In a best efforts underwriting in which
the underwriter would sell certificates in a public offering on an agency basis, the underwriter would receive an
agency commission rather than a fee based on the difference between the price at which the certificates are sold to
the public and what it pays the sponsor. In some private placements the underwriter may buy certificates as principal,
in which case its compensation would be the difference between what it receives for the certificates that it sells
and what it pays the sponsor for these certificates.



Purchase of Receivables by the Servicer



17. The applicant represents that as the principal amount of the receivables in a trust is reduced by payment, the cost
of administering the trust generally increases, making the servicing of the trust prohibitively expensive at some
point. Consequently the pooling and servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchase the receivables
included in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balance payable on the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage
(usually between 5 and 10 percent) of the initial balance.

The repurchase price for such an option is set at a level such that the certificateholders will receive the full amount
on all of the receivables held by the trust plus the accrued interest at the pass-through rate plus the full amount of
property, if any, that has been required by the trust through collections on or liquidations of the receivables.



Certificate Ratings



18. The certificates will have received one of the three highest ratings available from either S&P's, Moody's,
D&P or Fitch. Insurance or other credit support (such as overcollateralization, surety bonds, letter of credit
or guarantees) will be obtained by the trust sponsor to the extent necessary for the certificates to attain the desired
rating. The amount of this credit support is set by the rating agencies at a level that is a multiple of the worst historical
net credit loss experience for the type of obligations included in the issuing trust.



Provision of Credit Support



19. In some cases, the master servicer, or an affiliate of the master servicer, may provide credit support to the trust
(i.e., act as an insurer). In these cases, the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance funds
to the full extent that it determines that such advances will be recoverable (a) out of late payments by the obligors,
(b) from the credit support provider (which may be itself) or, (c) in the case of a trust that issues subordinated certificates,
from amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinated certificates, and the master servicer will advance
such funds in a timely manner. In some transactions, the master servicer may not be obligated to advance funds, but
instead would be called upon to provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of its obligations as insurer.
Moreover, a master servicer typically can recover advances either from the provider of credit support or from the
future payment stream. When the servicer is the provider of the credit support and provides its own funds to cover defaulted
payments, it will do so either on the initiative of the trustee, or on its own initiative on behalf of the trustee, but
in either event it will provide such funds to cover payments to the full extent of its obligations under the credit support
mechanism.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00136 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

If the master servicer fails to advance funds, fails to call upon the credit support mechanism to provide funds to cover
defaulted payments, or otherwise fails in its duties, the trustee would be required and would be able to enforce the
certificateholders' rights, as both a party to the pooling and servicing agreement and the owner of the trust estate,
including rights under the credit support mechanism. Therefore, the trustee, who is independent of the servicer,
will have the ultimate right to enforce the credit support arrangement.

When a master servicer advances funds, the amount so advanced is recoverable by the master servicer out of future payments
on receivables held by the trust to the extent not covered by credit support. However, where the master servicer provides
credit support to the trust, there are protections in place to guard against a delay in calling upon the credit support
to take advantage of the fact that the credit support declines proportionally with the decrease in the principal amount
of the obligations in the trust as payments on receivables are passed through to investors. These safeguards include:

(a) There is often a disincentive to postponing credit losses because the sooner repossession or foreclosure activities
are commenced, the more value that can be realized on the security for the obligation;

(b) The master servicer has servicing guidelines which include a general policy as to the allowable delinquency period
after which an obligation ordinarily will be deemed uncollectible. The pooling and servicing agreement will require
the master servicer to follow its normal servicing guidelines and will set forth the master servicer's general policy
as to the period of time after which delinquent obligations ordinarily will be considered uncollectible;

(c) As frequently as payments are due on the receivables included in the trust (monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually
as set forth in the pooling and servicing agreement), the master servicer is required to report to the independent
trustee the amount of all past-due payments and the amount of all servicer advances, along with other current information
as to collections on the receivables and draws upon the credit support. Further, the master servicer is required to
deliver to the trustee annually a certificate of an executive officer of the master servicer stating that a review
of the servicing activities has been made under such officer's supervision, and either stating that the master servicer
has fulfilled all of its obligations under the pooling and servicing agreement or, if the master servicer has defaulted
under any of its obligations, specifying any such default. The master servicer's reports are reviewed at least annually
by independent accountants to ensure that the master servicer is following its normal servicing standards and that
the master servicer's reports conform to the master servicer's internal accounting records. The results of the independent
accountants' review are delivered to the trustee;

(d) The credit support has a ``floor'' dollar amount that protects investors against the possibility that a large
number of credit losses might occur towards the end of the life of the trust, whether due to servicer advances or any
other cause. Once the floor amount has been reached, the master servicer lacks an incentive to postpone the recognition
of credit losses because the credit support amount becomes a fixed dollar amount, subject to reduction only for actual
draws. From the time that the floor amount is effective until the end of the life of the trust, there are no proportionate
reductions in the credit support amount caused by reductions in the pool principal balance. Indeed, since the floor
is a fixed dollar amount, the amount of credit support ordinarily increases as a percentage of the pool principal balance
during the period that the floor is in effect. The protection provided by a floor dollar amount to the credit support
applies particularly where the master servicer and the insurer are affiliated or are the same entity. (An entity should
not be considered as insurer solely because it holds subordinated certificates.)



Disclosure



20. In connection with the original issuance of certificates, the prospectus or private placement memorandum will
be furnished to investing plans. The prospectus or private placement memorandum will contain information material
to a fiduciary's decision to invest in the certificates, including:


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00137 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00068 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) Information concerning the payment terms of the certificates, the rating of the certificates, and any material
risk factors with respect to the certificates;

(b) A description of the trust as a legal entity and a description of how the trust was formed by the seller/servicer
or other sponsor of the transaction;

(c) Identification of the independent trustee for the trust;

(d) A description of the receivables contained in the trust, including the types of receivables, the diversification
of the receivables, their principal terms and their material legal aspects;

(e) A description of the sponsor and servicer;

(f) A description of the pooling and servicing agreement, including a description of the seller's principal representations
and warranties as to the trust assets and the trustee's remedy for any breach thereof; a description of the procedures
for collection of payments on receivables and for making distributions to investors, and a description of the accounts
into which such payments are deposited and from which such distributions are made; identification of the servicing
compensation and any fees for credit enhancement that are deducted from payments on receivables before distributions
are made to investors; a description of periodic statements provided to the trustee, and provided to or made available
to investors by the trustee; and a description of the events that constitute events of default under the pooling and
servicing contract and a description of the trustee's and the investors' remedies incident thereto;

(g) A description of the credit support;

(h) A general discussion of the principal federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition
of the pass-through securities by a typical investor;

(i) A description of the underwriters' and/or placement agent's plan for distributing the pass-through securities
to investors; and

(j) Information about the scope and nature of the secondary market, if any, for the certificates.

21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least
as frequently as distributions are made to certificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic
information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where
applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables.

22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer
or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and a modification of the disclosure
requirements for annual reports on Form 10-K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would
continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8-K to report material developments concerning
the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting
requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as
to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information
regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies,
servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and
the amount of compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating
agency or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates.

In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the
trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will include information regarding
the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will typically contain information
regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the guaranty or other credit support
and a breakdown of payments between principal and interest.



Forward Delivery Commitments



24. NatWest represents that, to date, it has not entered into any forward delivery commitments in connection with
the offering of pass-through certificates. However, NatWest states that it may contemplate entering into such commitments.
NatWest notes that the utility of forward delivery commitments has been recognized with respect to the offering of
similar certificates backed by pools of residential mortgages. As such, NatWest states that it may find it desirable
in the future to enter into such commitments for the purchase of certificates.



Secondary Market Transactions



25. NatWest, to the extent it obtains Section 20 Authority (see rep. 1, above) would normally attempt to make a market
for securities for which it is lead or co-managing underwriter in the future. It is also NatWest's general policy to
facilitate sales by investors who have purchased certificates if NatWest has acted as placement agent in the original
placement of the certificates and if such investors request NatWest's assistance. Such policy is in effect for the
transaction entered into on December 22, 1993, as to which NatWest Bank Plc acted as placement agent.

Retroactive Relief



26. NatWest represents that it has engaged in one transaction related to mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
(see rep 1, above), based on the assumption that retroactive relief would not be granted. NatWest represents that
the transaction was entered into in conformance with the exception contained in the Department's regulation relating
to the definition of plan assets (29 CFR 2510.3-101) which applies where equity participation by benefit plan
investors is not ``significant''. However, it is difficult to monitor whether the percentage interest of plans in
a trust is at all times not ``significant'' for purposes of that regulation. Accordingly, relief is requested for
transactions which have occurred on or after December 22, 1993.



Summary



27. In summary, the applicant represents that the transactions for which exemptive relief is requested satisfy the
statutory criteria of section 408(a) of the Act due to the following:

(a) The trusts contain ``fixed pools'' of assets. There is little discretion on the part of the trust sponsor to substitute
receivables contained in the trust once the trust has been formed;

(b) Certificates in which plans invest will have been rated in one of the three highest rating categories by S&P's,
Moody's, D&P or Fitch. Credit support will be obtained to the extent necessary to attain the desired rating;

(c) All transactions for which NatWest seeks exemptive relief will be governed by the pooling and servicing agreement,
which is made available to plan fiduciaries for their review prior to the plan's investment in certificates;

(d) Exemptive relief from sections 406(b) and 407 for sales to plans is substantially limited; and

(e) NatWest anticipates that it will make a secondary market in certificates with respect to which it acts as an underwriter
in the future.



Discussion of Proposed Exemption



I. Differences Between Proposed Exemption and Class Exemption PTE 83-1



The exemptive relief proposed herein is similar to that provided in PTE 81-7 (46 FR 7520, January 23, 1981), Class
Exemption for Certain Transactions Involving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, amended and restated as PTE 83-1
(48 FR 895, January 7, 1983).

PTE 83-1 applies to mortgage pool investment trusts consisting of interest-bearing obligations secured by
first or second mortgages or deeds of trust on single-family residential property. The exemption provides relief
from sections 406(a) and 407 for the sale, exchange or transfer in the initial issuance of mortgage pool certificates
between the trust sponsor and a plan, when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a party-in-interest with
respect to the plan, and the continued holding of such certificates, provided that the conditions set forth in the
exemption are met. PTE 83-1 also provides exemptive relief from section 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act for the
above-described transactions when the sponsor, trustee or insurer of the trust is a fiduciary with respect to the
plan assets invested in such certificates, provided that additional conditions set forth in the exemption are met.
In particular, section 406(b) relief is conditioned upon the approval of the transaction by an independent fiduciary.
Moreover, the total value of certificates purchased by a plan must not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the issue,
and at least 50 percent of the aggregate amount of the issue must be acquired by persons independent of the trust sponsor,
trustee or insurer. Finally, PTE 83-1 provides conditional exemptive relief from section 406 (a) and (b) of
the Act for transactions in connection with the servicing and operation of the mortgage trust.

Under PTE 83-1, exemptive relief for the above transactions is conditioned upon the sponsor and the trustee
of the mortgage trust maintaining a system for insuring or otherwise protecting the pooled mortgage loans and the
property securing such loans, and for indemnifying certificate holders against reductions in pass-through payments
due to defaults in loan payments or property damage. This system must provide such protection and indemnification
up to an amount not less than the greater of one percent of the aggregate principal balance of all trust mortgages or
the principal balance of the largest mortgage.

The exemptive relief proposed herein differs from that provided by PTE 83-1 in the following major respects:
(1) The proposed exemption provides individual exemptive relief rather than class relief; (2) The proposed exemption
covers transactions involving trusts containing a broader range of assets than single-family residential mortgages;
(3) Instead of requiring a system for insuring the pooled receivables, the proposed exemption conditions relief
upon the certificates having received one of the three highest ratings available from S&P's, Moody's, D&P
or Fitch (insurance or other credit support would be obtained only to the extent necessary for the certificates to
attain the desired rating); and (4) The proposed exemption provides more limited section 406(b) and section 407 relief
for sales transactions.



II. Rating of Certificates



After consideration of the representations of the applicant and information provided by S&P's, Moody's, D&P
and Fitch, the Department has decided to condition exemptive relief upon the certificates having attained a rating
in one of the three highest generic rating categories from S&P's, Moody's, D&P or Fitch. The Department believes
that the rating condition will permit the applicant flexibility in structuring trusts containing a variety of mortgages
and other receivables while ensuring that the interests of plans investing in certificates are protected. The Department
also believes that the ratings are indicative of the relative safety of investments in trusts containing secured
receivables. The Department is conditioning the proposed excemptive relief upon each particular type of asset-backed
security having been rated in one of the three highest rating categories for at least one year and having been sold to
investors other than plans for at least one year.

III. Limited Section 406(b) and Section 407(a) Relief for Sales



NatWest represents that in some cases a trust sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, and obligor with respect to receivables
contained in a trust, or an underwriter and/or placement agent of certificates may be a pre-existing party in interest
with respect to an investing plan.
 In these cases, a direct or indirect sale or certificates by that party in interest to the plan would be a prohibited
sale or exchange of property under section 406(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
 Likewise, issues are raised under section 406(a)(1)(D) of the Act where a plan fiduciary causes a plan to purchase
certificates where trust funds will be used to benefit a party in interest.






Additionally, NatWest represents that a trust sponsor, servicer, trustee, insurer, and obligor with respect to
receivables contained in a trust, or an underwriter and/or placement agent of certificates representing an interest
in a trust may be a fiduciary with respect to an investing plan. NatWest represents that the exercise of fiduciary authority
by any of these parties to cause the plan to invest in certificates representing an interest in the trust would violate
section 406(b)(1), and in some cases section 406(b)(2), of the Act.

Moreover, NatWest represents that to the extent there is a plan asset ``look through'' to the underlying assets of
a trust, the investment in certificates by a plan covering employees of an obligor under receivables contained in
a trust may be prohibited by sections 406(a) and 407(a) of the Act.

After consideration of the issues involved, the Department has determined to provide the limited sections 406(b)
and 407(a) relief as specified in the proposed exemption.

General Information



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:

(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries;

(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;

(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and

(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






In the Matter of Guillermo Velasquez, M.D. San Juan, PR



Confirmatory Order



I



Guillermo Velasquez, M.D. (Licensee) is the holder of expired Byproduct Materials License No. 52-21082-01
(license) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35 on September
3, 1982. The license authorized the use of strontium-90 for ophthalmic radiotherapy in accordance with the conditions
specified therein. The license was renewed in its entirety on August 21, 1987, and expired on August 31, 1992. The byproduct
material remained in the possession of the Licensee until it was transferred to an authorized recipient on January
7, 1994 pursuant to an NRC Order to Transfer Byproduct Material to an Authorized Recipient (Effective Immediately)
and Demand for Information issued July 21, 1993.



II



The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the license prior to its expiration, as required by 10 CFR
30.37, nor did the Licensee notify the Commission in writing, pursuant to 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the
license. Therefore, on September 11, 1992, NRC Region II issued a Notice of Violation (Notice) to the Licensee for
failure to request renewal prior to expiration of the license or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct
material. The letter forwarding the Notice directed the Licensee to place the strontium-90 in storage and to discontinue
use of the material until he obtained a new NRC license. In the alternative, the Licensee was directed to transfer the
material to an authorized recipient if adequate storage was not available, or to submit an NRC Form 314 to the NRC if
the Licensee chose to dispose of the byproduct material. During a December 4, 1992 telephone conversation between
a Region II inspector and the Licensee, the Licensee stated that the source was locked in storage and that the Licensee
had not used the source. The Licensee responded to the Notice on December 4, 1992, by requesting renewal of the license.
Because the Licensee failed to provide the appropriate licensing fee, no action was taken by the NRC to renew the license
and the Licensee was notified.

The NRC performed a routine inspection of the Licensee's facility in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico on February 24, 1993.
One purpose of this inspection was to determine the status of the strontium-90 source. The inspection revealed that
the Licensee had continued to use the material: (1) After expiration of the license; (2) after receipt of the NRC letter
and Notice dated September 11, 1992, which directed the Licensee to place the material in storage and to discontinue
use of the material until a new license was obtained; and (3) after the December 4, 1992 telephone conversation with
the Region II inspector when the inspector explained that the source could not be used and the Licensee had stated the
source was in locked storage and not being used.

In April and May 1993, the NRC Office of Investigations conducted an investigation of the circumstances surrounding
the Licensee's apparent use of the source after the license had expired and after receiving notification from the
NRC to discontinue use of the material until a new license was obtained. As a result of this investigation, it was determined
that on 20 occasions, between October 9, 1992, and February 19, 1993, the Licensee, with the full understanding that
use of the source was prohibited, deliberately used the strontium-90 source for patient ophthalmic radiotherapy,
in violation of 10 CFR 30.3. In addition, the investigation confirmed that the Licensee deliberately provided false
information to the NRC inspector during the December 4, 1992 telephone conversation and during the inspection conducted
at the Licensee's facility on February 24, 1993. Specifically, the Licensee told the NRC inspector that the strontium-90
source had not been used for ophthalmic radiotherapy since receipt of the Notice which was issued on September 11,
1992, when in fact the Licensee had used the strontium-90 source at least 20 times between October 9, 1992 and February
19, 1993, which was as recently as five days before the inspection. This deliberate submission of materially false
information constitutes violations of 10 CFR 30.9 and 30.10.



III



Based on the NRC inspection and the subsequent investigation, the NRC determined that the Licensee, by continuing
to use licensed material after being notified of the expiration of the license which authorized that use and by deliberately
providing false information to an NRC inspector, had demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with Commission requirements.
The Commission must be able to rely on its licensees to provide complete and accurate information. Willful violations
are of particular concern to the Commission because they undermine the Commission's reasonable assurance that licensed
activities are being conducted in accordance with NRC requirements. Therefore, on July 21, 1993, the NRC issued an
Order to the Licensee requiring the transfer of the strontium-90 source to an authorized recipient within 45 days
of the date of the Order. The NRC also issued a Demand for Information with the Order requiring the Licensee to submit
a written statement, under oath or affirmation, stating why the NRC should have confidence that in the future the Licensee
would comply with NRC requirements or provide complete and accurate information to the NRC.

The Licensee responded to the Order in letters dated September 7 and 13, 1993, and in telephone conversations with
the NRC Region II staff on September 10 and 20, 1993. During these communications, the Licensee indicated that he was
making a good faith effort to transfer the byproduct material to an authorized recipient. Based on this good faith
effort, the NRC by letter dated October 15, 1993, extended the strontium-90 transfer date to December 6, 1993. On January
24, 1994, the Licensee submitted a completed NRC Form 314 notifying the NRC that the strontium-90 source had been transferred
to an authorized recipient and provided the documentation required by the Order to demonstrate that the source was
tested for leakage prior to the transfer and that the transfer had taken place.

<PARENT> FR940610-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

On September 13, 1993, the Licensee responded to the Demand for Information indicating that he did not intend to perform
licensed activities or to use the strontium-90 source in his possession, or one in anyone else's possession. Further,
in a telephone conversation on June 2, 1994, with Mr. Charles M. Hosey of the NRC Region II office, Dr. Velasquez agreed
to the provisions and to the issuance of this Confirmatory Order. I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth
in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the public health and
safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require
that the Licensee's commitments in the telephone call of June 2, 1994 be confirmed by this Order.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 160o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations at 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR parts 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that:

1. For a period of three years from the date of this Confirmatory Order, Guillermo Velasquez, M.D., shall not supervise
or engage in any way in NRC-licensed activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted
pursuant to a specific or general license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement
State licensees conducted pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.

2. For a period of three years from the date of this Order, Dr. Velasquez shall provide a copy of this Order to any prospective
employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities (as defined in 1. above) prior to his acceptance of employment with
such prospective employer. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the employer is aware of Dr. Velasquez'
prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities.

3. The first time Guillermo Velasquez, M.D., is employed in NRC licensed activities following the three year prohibition,
he shall notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia
30323, prior to engaging in NRC licensed activities including activities under an Agreement State license when activities
under that license are conducted in areas of NRC jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 150.20. The notice shall include the
name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement State licensee and the location where licensed activities
will be performed.

The Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing
by the Licensee of good cause.



V 

Any person adversely affected by this Confirmatory Order, other than the Licensee, may request a hearing within 20
days of the date of its issuance. Any request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies shall be sent to the Director,
Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel
for Hearings and Enforcement at same address, and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street,
NW., suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323 and to the Licensee. If such a person requests a hearing, that person shall
set forth with particularity the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address
the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).

If a hearing is requested by a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an Order designating
the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be whether this
Confirmatory Order should be sustained.

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in section V above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request
for reclearance of two information collections. OPM Forms 1496, Application for Deferred Retirement (Separation
before October 1, 1956), and 1496A, Application for Deferred Retirement (Separation on or after October 1, 1956),
are used by eligible former Federal employees to apply for a deferred Civil Service annuity. Two forms are needed because
there was a major revision in the law effective October 1, 1956; this affects the general information provided with
the forms.



Approximately 3,000 deferred retirements are processed annually; 200 of these are submitted on OPM Form 1496 and
2,800 are on OPM Form 1496A. Both forms take approximately 60 minutes to complete. The combined annual burden is 3,000
hours.

<DOCTITLE>Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee Open Committee Meeting</DOCTITLE>



According to the provisions of section 10 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Pub. L. 92-463), notice is hereby
given that meetings of the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee will be held on_




Thursday, July 7, 1994

Thursday, July 21, 1994

Thursday, Aug. 11, 1994

Thursday, Aug. 25, 1994




The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.

The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, five representatives from labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and five representatives from Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347.

The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.

These scheduled meetings start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During
the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy
and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matters discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair
the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matters being considered and would disrupt substantially

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Changes and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Changes and Amendments Thereto by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Chicago Board Options
Exchange, Inc., New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Narrow-Based Index Options Listing Standards.



June 3, 1994.



I. Introduction



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 on September 23, 1992, December 22, 1993, May 4, 1994, March 3, 1994, and January 31, 1994, the American Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``Amex''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''),
 the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''),
 and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''),
 respectively (each individually referred to herein as an ``Exchange'' and two or more collectively referred to as
``Exchanges''), submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') proposed rule changes to
establish generic listing standards for options on narrow-based indexes, and to adopt streamlined procedures for
introducing trading in options that satisfy these listing standards.










On January 5, 1994 and May 25, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment Nos. 1

 and 2,
 respectively; on April 8, 1994, the CBOE filed Amendment No. 1;
 on April 19, 1994, the PSE filed Amendment No. 1;
 and on April 22, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1,
 to their respective proposals (collectively, ``Exchange Amendments'').









The Amex and CBOE proposals were published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 on November 25, 1992 and February 25, 1994, respectively.
 No comments were received on these proposed rule changes. This order approves the Exchanges' proposals and the Exchange
Amendments.





II. Description of Proposals



The Exchanges have submitted substantively identical proposals to the Commission to amend their respective rules
 to establish generic listing standards for options on narrow-based indexes (also known as sector or industry indexes)
and procedures designed to expedite the approval of trading of such products. Currently, an Exchange must submit
a proposed rule change to the Commission for review in accordance with section 19(b)(2) of the Act (``section 19(b)(2)''),
and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, in order to list for trading options on a particular index. The Exchanges' proposed
rule changes would permit an Exchange to list classes of options on a particular narrow-based index
 that satisfy specified generic listing standards, pursuant to a filing submitted to the Commission for effectiveness
immediately upon filing under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act (``section 19(b)(3)(A)'').
 Under the streamlined procedures, trading in options on the narrow-based index could commence 30 days from the date
of filing of the proposal to list such options.







A. Listing and Maintenance Listing Standards



In order to qualify for the streamlined listing procedures, the particular narrow-based index underlying the proposed
narrow-based index options must satisfy all of the following initial listing standards, and continue to satisfy
the following maintenance listing criteria.

1. Standards Relating to Component Stocks



The proposed initial listing and maintenance listing standards require that all component stocks be deemed ``reported
securities,'' as that term is defined in Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act.
 Upon the initial listing of narrow-based index options approved for trading pursuant to the procedures contained
in this order, the underlying index must include at least ten component stocks. Thereafter, the index must contain
at least nine component stocks at all times. In addition, the number of component stocks may not increase or decrease
by a number exceeding 331/3 percent of the number of stocks comprising the index at the time of its initial listing.





Both initial and maintenance listing standards require that the component stocks comprising the top 90 percent of
the index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $75 million. In addition, the component stocks
constituting the bottom 10 percent of the index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $50 million.

The listing and maintenance listing standards also include trading volume requirements. The component stocks comprising
the top 90 percent of the index, by weight, must have a monthly trading volume of at least one million shares per month
over the six months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission; thereafter, the component stocks must maintain
monthly trading volume of at least 500,000 shares per month. The trading volume for the component stocks constituting
the bottom 10 percent of the index, by weight, must have been at least 500,000 shares over the same period; thereafter,
they must maintain an average monthly trading volume of at least 400,000 shares per month. If the index is capitalization-weighted,
and it contains 15 or more component stocks, the top five weighted component stocks each must have an average monthly
trading volume over the six months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission of at least two million shares;
thereafter, it must maintain an average monthly trading volume over the prior six months of at least one million shares.
If a capitalization-weighted index contains less than 15 component stocks, those component stocks comprising the
top 30 percent of the total number of stocks in the index each must have an average monthly trading volume over the six
months preceding the filing of the index with the Commission of at least two million shares; thereafter, it must maintain
an average monthly trading volume over the prior six months of at least one million shares.

Initially and thereafter, no inidividual component stock in the index may represent more than 25 percent of the weight
of the index. In addition, initially and thereafter, where an index is comprised of less than 25 stocks, the top five
highest weighted stocks may not constitute more than 60 percent of the weight of the index; and where an index is comprised
of 25 stocks or more, the top five highest weighted stocks may not represent more than 50 percent of the weight of the
index.

At all times, at least 90 percent of the stocks in the index, by weight, and 80 percent of the total number of stocks comprising
the index, individually must satisfy the particular Exchange's rules governing the listing and maintenance of listing
of options thereon.

Both initial and maintenance listing standards require that no more than 20 percent of the securities in the index,
by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'') overlying foreign
securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the particular U.S. options
Exchange and the primary exchange on which the foreign security underlying the ADR is traded.

2. Standards Relating to the Index and Options Thereon



A narrow-based index subject to the requirements of this order must be cash-settled. The index value may be calculated
only pursuant to a capitalization, price, or equal-dollar weighted methodology.
 The index value must be disseminated at least once every 15 seconds during the trading hours of the index. The settlement
value of expiring index options must be based upon the opening prices of the component securities on the primary exchange
on which they are traded (or on the Nasdaq National Market) (otherwise known as ``A.M. settlement'') on the applicable
expiration date.







If a narrow-based index is maintained by a broker-dealer, it shall be calculated by a third party that is not a broker-dealer.
Further, appropriate procedures must be established by the Exchange and the broker-dealer to ensure that the broker-dealer
will not possess or be able to misuse any informational advantages with respect to changes in the composition or the
level of such index. Such procedures must include, for example, the establishment of appropriate informational
barriers.

The streamlined procedures described herein pertaining to the listing of new narrow-based index options would apply
to all narrow-based index options permitted under the rules of the Exchanges, including long-term options and reduced-value
long-term options that otherwise satisfy the particular Exchange's rules governing long-term options and reduced-value
long-term options.






In the event that a class of narrow-based index options listed on an Exchange pursuant to the streamlined listing procedures
described herein fails to satisfy one or more of the required maintenance criteria, the Exchange responsible for
that index option must notify the Commission staff immediately upon discovery of such failure. Further, the Exchange
shall not open for trading any additional series of options on that class unless the Exchange determines that such
failure is not significant, and the Commission affirmatively concurs in that determination, or unless the Commission
specifically approves the continued listing of that class of index options pursuant to a proposal filed in accordance
with Section 19(b)(2).



B. Review Procedure



If a particular narrow-based index (and options thereon) proposed by an Exchange satisfy the foregoing generic listing
standards, then such Exchange may vial itself of certain streamlined listing procedures. The procedures proposed
in the Exchanges' filings are designed to allow them to list narrow-based index options without undergoing the formal
process of review and approval by the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(2). An Exchange would be required to submit
its proposal in draft form to Commission staff at least one week prior to the Exchange's formal filing of the rule change
proposal. The Exchange would then submit its formal rule change proposal for effectiveness immediately upon filing,
pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A). However, to allow the Commission adequate opportunity to verify the representations
made by the Exchange in its proposal and review and address any concerns raised by the proposal or by commenters, the
Exchange would be allowed to establish a trade date for the commencement of trading of options on the index no earlier
than 30 days from the date of the formal filing of the proposal.

If the Commission determines that the Exchange proposal does not satisfy the generic standards, or if the Commission
deems it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission, pursuant
to section 19(b)(3)(C) of the Act, has 60 days from the date of the filing of the Exchange's proposal to abrogate the
Exchange's rule change and require that the Exchange refile the proposed rule change for formal Commission review
pursuant to section 19(b) (1) and (2).



III. Commission Findings and Conclusions



A. Generic Listing Standards



The Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the Exchange's proposals to establish generic listing standards for narrow-based index options strike
a reasonable balance between the Commission's mandates under section 6(b)(5) to remove impediments to and perfect
the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, while protecting investors and the public interest.
Thus, the Commission finds that the listing by an Exchange of options on particular narrow-based indexes, in accordance
with the requirements stated herein, will constitute a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect
to the administration of an existing Exchange rule, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A), relieving the Exchange of the
former requirement of obtaining specific Commission approval of such narrow-based index options pursuant to section
19(b)(2).

The Commission believes that trading options on an index (including a narrow-based index) of securities permits
investors to participate in the price movements of the index's underlying securities, and allows investors holding
positions in some or all of such securities to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. The Commission further
believes that trading options on an index provides investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that
is designed to reflect accurately the overall movement of the component stocks. 

Currently, when an exchange intends to list options on an index of securities which the Commission has not specifically
approved previously for the listing and trading of such index options, the Exchange must submit a proposed rule change
to the Commission pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19b-4 thereunder. Pursuant to section 6(b)(5)
of the Act, the Commission must find, among other things, that trading in options on the particular index will serve
to protect investors and contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. In this regard, the Commission
must predicate approval of any new option proposal upon a finding that the introduction of such derivative instrument
is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other
economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed
by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid
regulatory concerns. 


Accordingly, before approving an Exchange proposal to list options on a particular index, and consistent with its
legislative mandate, the Commission must conclude that the Exchange has addressed several issues pertaining to
the particular index, including the design and structure of the index, customer protection, surveillance, and market
impact. Specifically, with respect to index design and structure, the Commission takes into account, among other
things, the number of securities comprising the index, the market capitalizations of the component securities,
their relative weightings in the index, their trading volume, and the extent to which the component securities individually,
satisfy the Exchange's requirements for the listing of equity options thereon. It is with respect to these criteria,
among others, that this order establishes generic standards which, if satisfied, would allow an Exchange to file
a proposed rule change, effective immediately upon filing, to list and trade options on a particular narrow-based
index 30 days from the filing date.
 





The Commission believes that the listing and maintenance listing standards set forth herein are consistent with
the criteria currently utilized in the Commission's case-by-case consideration of narrow-based index option proposals,
and are reasonably designed to ensure the protection of investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission
finds that the generic standards covering minimum capitalization, monthly trading volume, and relative weightings
of component stocks are designed to ensure that the trading markets for component stocks are adequately capitalized
and sufficiently liquid, and that no one stock or stock group dominates that index. Thus, the Commission believes
that the satisfaction of these requirements significantly minimizes the potential for manipulation of the index.



Two other important requirements are that at least 90 percent of the component stocks, by weight, must be eligible
individually for options trading, and that no more than 20 percent of the index may be comprised of ADRs which are not
subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement. The Commission believes that these standards are necessary
to ensure that index options are not used as surrogate instruments to trade options on stocks and/or ADRs that otherwise
are not eligible for options trading., 

The Commission also believes that the number of securities required to constitute the narrow-based index is large
enough to ensure that an index is not created for the purpose of obtaining more favorable regulatory treatment, e.g.,
with respect to position and exercise limits, as compared with the trading of options in the underlying stocks.

<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00153 </DOCNO>

The Commission also finds the requirements that all securities comprising the index be ``reported securities,''
as defined in Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act, and that the index value be disseminated at least once every 15 seconds
during trading hours of the index, will contribute significantly to the transparency of the market for such index
options.
 The Commission further believes that basing the settlement value of expiring index options upon the opening prices
of the component securities on the primary exchange on which they are traded (or on the Nasdaq National Market) may
help contain the volatility of related markets upon their expiration.





The Commission notes that an Exchange which lists options pursuant to this order must notify the Commission immediately
upon discovering that such options have failed to satisfy the maintenance listing standards described herein, and
is prohibited from listing any additional series of such options unless the Exchange, with the affirmative concurrence
of the Commission, determines that such failure is insignificant. The Commission believes that this requirement
helps to ensure the continued compliance of such new option products with the standards set forth in this order, and
confirms the obligation of the Exchanges to monitor all series of options listed thereon to ensure that they continue
to satisfy the maintenance listing standards prescribed in their respective rules. On the other hand, this requirement
will allow the Commission to provide flexibility on the issue of continued listing, where the failure to meet a particular
standard is insignificant and will not hinder the protection of investors or cause the index to be susceptible to manipulation.

The Commission further notes that each of the Exchanges' rules that are applicable to narrow-based index options,
including provisions addressing sales practices, floor trading procedures, position and exercise limits,
 margin requirements, and trading halts and suspensions, will continue to apply to any narrow-based index listed
pursuant to the streamlined approval procedures described herein.





Finally, the Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an Exchange proposing
to list a stock index derivative product and the exchange(s) trading the stocks underlying the derivative product
is an important measure for surveillance of the derivative and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure
the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses,
thereby making the stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. In this regard, all of the Exchanges,
as well as the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), are members of the Intermarket Surveillance
Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information.
 In light of the Exchanges' membership in the ISG, and the fact that the generic listing and maintenance listing standards
ensure that all stocks (and ADRs) comprising a narrow-based index being added pursuant to this order would be listed
on a U.S. exchange (or quoted on and traded through the Nasdaq National Market), the Commission is satisfied that the
ISG Agreement would cover investigations and inquiries regarding trading activity in options on narrow-based indexes
and their underlying component securities. In addition, the Commission finds that the requirement that no more than
20 percent of the weight of the index may be comprised of ADRs that are not subject to a comprehensive surveillance sharing
agreement between the particular U.S. exchange and the primary market of the underlying security will continue to
ensure that the Exchanges have the ability to adequately surveil trading in the narrow-based index options and the
ADR components of the index.

B. Commission Review of Exchange Proposals



The Commission finds that the review procedures provide the Commission with sufficient opportunity to examine the
representations made by an Exchange in connection with its listing of options on a narrow-based index pursuant to
section 19(b)(3)(A). Specifically, the Commission believes that the seven day prefiling requirement gives the
Commission staff an opportunity to discuss with an Exchange whether its proposal to list and trade particular narrow-based
index options properly qualifies for effectiveness upon filing. In addition, the Commission finds that the 30 day
delay in the commencement of trading of proposed narrow-based index options will provide a meaningful opportunity
for public comment prior to the commencement of trading, while also providing the Exchanges with the opportunity
to inform market participants in advance of the proposed trade date for a new index option. In accordance with section
19(b)(3)(C) of the Act, if the Commission determines that the rule change proposal is inconsistent with the requirements
of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, the 30 day delay would allow the Commission to abrogate the rule
change before trading commences, which will minimize disruption on market participants. This authority could be
utilized if, for example, it is determined that the proposed narrow-based index option does not satisfy the applicable
generic listing standards.

The Commission notes that its ability to review an Exchange's proposal submitted under the procedures outlined herein
would not necessarily be limited to determining whether proposed narrow-based index options satisfy the generic
standards. Rather, the Commission will have an opportunity to determine whether the proposed index options raise
other regulatory concerns that should be addressed before trading commences. For example, the Commission will have
an opportunity to determine whether the listing and trading of options on the new narrow-based index will have an adverse
impact on the underlying securities markets.






In summary, if the Commission determines that a proposed index option product does not completely satisfy the generic
listing standards, or if based on the foregoing considerations it generally appears to the Commission to be necessary
or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors, the Commission, within 60 days of the Exchange's
filing, may summarily abrogate the Exchange's rule change and require that the rule proposal be filed with the Commission
pursuant to sections 19(b) (1) and (2) of the Act. Although the purpose of streamlining the review of new narrow-based
index options by creating generic standards is to facilitate the Exchanges' ability to list such new products as the
demand for them arises, the Commission believes nevertheless that its authority to abrogate such a rule change proposal
supplies a significant regulatory check on the Exchanges to ensure that these new standards are implemented properly.



C. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes and Exchange Amendments



The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes filed by the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx, and the Exchange
Amendments, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register.

 The rule changes proposed by the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx, and Amex Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, conform their proposals to the
CBOE's proposal. Further, the CBOE's proposal was published for the full 21-day comment period, and no comments were
received. With the exception of Amex Amendment Nos. 1 and 2, the Exchange Amendments clarify, but do not change, the
proposed rule changes. The Commission finds, therefore, that no new regulatory issues are raised by the foregoing
proposed rule changes and the Exchange Amendments. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with sections
19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve the NYSE, PSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes and Exchange Amendments on
an accelerated basis.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change to Add a Standing
Instruction Database to the Institutional Delivery System</DOCTITLE>



June 6, 1994.



On January 31, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-01) under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 to implement the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced institutional delivery (``ID'') system.
 Notice of the proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 4, 1994.
 The Commission received three comment letters supporting implementation of the proposal.
 The Commission also received one comment letter that discussed the structure of current self-regulatory organization
(``SRO'') confirmation/acknowledgement rules and a response to the comment letter from DTC.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.

I. Description 



The standing instruction database is a central repository for customer account and settlement information furnished
by institutions, agents, and broker-dealers. The information contained therein includes items such as the agent
for an institutional customer, the agent's internal account number for the institutional customer, and interested
parties. Using the standing instruction database, a broker-dealer can link its internal account numbers for its
institutional customers with the institutional customers' internal account numbers. When entering trade data
into the ID system, a broker-dealer can simply refer to its internal account number in the standing instruction database,
and the ID system will extract the necessary information (such as customer name, agent, interested parties, and settlement
related information) from the database and automatically will add the information to the confirmation. The standing
instruction database will eliminate the need for the broker-dealer to provide such information each time that the
broker-dealer enters trade data into the ID system. 

The standing instruction database is an account level optional feature for ID users. A broker-dealer with many institutional
accounts can designate that only specified accounts access the standing instruction database. If an account is not
designated to access the standing instruction database, the broker-dealer will provide the ID system with the type
of information that is contained in the database. However, once a broker-dealer links its internal customer account
number with account information furnished to the database by the institutional customer, the data will be used for
certain fields in ID system processing when the broker-dealer submits trade data for that institutional customer's
trades regardless of whether the broker-dealer submits data for those fields. Participants will have the ability
to enter a standing instruction database change with a specific effective date by specifying on which date the addition,
change, or deletion should take effect. 



II. Discussion 



Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency, such as DTC, be designed to promote the
prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
 As discussed below, the Commission believes that DTC's proposed rule change is consistent with this obligation.






The institutional delivery system provides an effective electronic communication network that replaces the written
documents that used to be passed among broker-dealers, investment managers, and custodian banks in order for these
parties to settle transactions within the regular-way (five business day) settlement cycle. In order to facilitate
timely settlement of institutional trades, which constitute a significant percentage of all market trades, several
self-regulatory organizations amended their rules in 1982 to require broker-dealers that extend delivery versus
payment credit privileges on transactions in depository eligible securities to use the facilities of a registered
securities depository for the confirmation, affirmation, and settlement of these transactions.
 Those changes were designed to facilitate routine trading volume of 100 million shares. In the twelve years since
the use of a registered securities depository for generating confirmations and affirmations became mandatory,
the U.S. securities markets have handled unprecedented volume and routinely settle trading of 300-400 million shares
daily. 





DTC's proposal expands the range of functions available to users of the ID system. In particular, the proposal will
allow broker-dealers, institutions, and agents to leave with DTC certain trade settlement information that routinely
appears on each confirmation and to draw on that information quickly when formatting confirmations. This will promote
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions consistent with Section 17A of the Act.


During the last twelve years, private vendors have offered services that are based on the ID system and encompass some
of the features that DTC now proposes to offer its participants. One such service provides database features which
allow institutions to advise broker-dealers how to allocate trades among institutional clients and which supply
that data to DTC's ID system to be used in generating confirmation and affirmations. The Commission is satisfied that
these private vendors will be able to continue to provide these services and supply data to ID. 

The standing instruction databases, along with the other enhancements to DTC's ID system,
 also will facilitate the industry's conversion to a three business day settlement cycle which will be the standard
settlement time for most broker-dealer trades beginning June 1, 1995.
 






III. Conclusion 



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements
of the Act and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.




It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-94-01) be, and hereby is, approved. 




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



ISCC is filing the proposed rule change to amend its linkage agreement with the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation
(``JSCC'') to allow ISCC to provide JSCC access, through ISCC, to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')
New York Window (``NYW'') services.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, an C below, of the most
significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) ISCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of NSCC and is a member of NSCC for the purposes of obtaining access to NSCC services
on behalf of foreign financial institutions with whom ISCC enters into linkage agreements. JSCC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and provides clearing services for securities listed on stock exchanges in
Japan. JSCC acts as the central depository for foreign shares, including U.S. shares, listed on stock exchanges in
Japan for the benefit of the beneficial owners thereof. It appoints local custodians with respect to non-Japanese
securities. In 1988, ISCC and JSCC entered into a linkage agreement which permitted JSCC to obtain access through
ISCC to certain services of the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') for U.S. shares listed on stock exchanges in Japan
and included in JSCC's central depository clearing system for foreign shares. ISCC and JSCC are entering into an amendment
to the linkage agreement which will permit JSCC to obtain access through ICC to NSCC's NYW services for initial public
offerings of U.S. securities listed on exchanges in Japan until such time as such securities are eligible for deposit
at DTC. The services provided through the NYW will be similar to that which JSCC obtains through ISCC from DTC for DTC
eligible securities. Deliveries and receives of these securities would be free of payment and would be initiated
based on instructions received from JSCC. The securities held by NSCC would be used as the basis for the bookkeeping
entries at JSCC. At such time as these securities become eligible at DTC they would be deposited at DTC for credit to
the account of JSCC. At that time, the services that ISCC. At that time, the services that ISCC provides to JSCC for these
issues will be the services covered under the terms of the original linkage agreement.

(b) The proposed rule changes fosters cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions and as such is therefore consistent with Section 17A of the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



ISCC does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



ISCC has received no written comments. ICC will notify the Commission of any written comments received by ISCC.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action.



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consent, the Commission will: 

A. By order approve the proposed rule change, or

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC, 20549. Copies of such filing also will be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization.

All submissions should refer to File No. SR-ISCC-94-2 and should be submitted by July 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board; Relating to Recordkeeping and Record Retention Requirements Concerning Gifts and Gratuities</DOCTITLE>



June 6, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 26, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to require
municipal securities dealers to keep records of gifts and gratuities given to others, including issuer officials
and employees, in relation to municipal securities activities. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing amendments to rule G-8 and G-9, on recordkeeping and record retention, that relate
to rule G-20, on gifts and gratuities concerning suitability of recommendations. The proposed rule change
requires dealers to keep records of gifts and gratuities given to others, including issuer officials and employees,
in relation to municipal securities activities. The Board is requesting that the rule change become effective 30
days after approval by the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



Rule G-20 is intended to prevent commercial bribery. The rule has three basic parts. First, rule G-20(a)
prohibits dealers from, directly or indirectly, giving or permitting to be given any thing or service of value in excess
of $100 per year to any person, other than to an employee or partner of the dealer, in relation to municipal securities
activities of the person's employer.
 All gifts given by a dealer and its associated persons are used to compute the $100 limitation. The $100 limitation
applies to gifts and gratuities to customers, individuals associated with issuers, and employees of other dealers.
In addition, based on the rule's ``directly or indirectly'' language, if a third party (e.g., a consultant hired by
a dealer) gives a gift to any such person at the request of the dealer, the value of the gift would be included in the $100
limitation.





Second, rule G-20(b) exempts certain payments from the $100 annual limit set forth in paragraph (a). These payments
are termed ``normal business dealings'' and are defined as occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical, sporting,
and other entertainments, as well as the sponsoring of legitimate business functions that are recognized by the IRS
as deductible business expenses, and gifts or reminder advertising. However, the rule also provides that such gifts
cannot be so frequent or so expensive as to raise a suggestion of unethical conduct.

Finally, rule G-20(c) provides that contracts of employment with or compensation for services rendered are
not considered gifts or gratuities subject to the $100 limitation. Such arrangements, however, must be in writing
and must include the nature of the proposed services, the amount of the proposed compensation, and the written consent
of such person's employer.

In 1993, the municipal securities market came under increased scrutiny because of concerns that municipal securities
dealers were influencing municipal securities issuers to hire such dealers for municipal securities business through
the payment of political contributions and other monies to persons with influence over the dealer selection process.
While the Board addressed the issue of political contributions through rule G-37, the Board was concerned that
other activities, such as excessive gifts, also might be viewed as influencing the dealer selection process.

The proposed rule change requires dealers to keep and retain specific records of all gifts and gratuities subject
to paragraph (a) of the rule.

2

 The proposed rule change also requires dealers to keep and retain records of all contracts of employment or agreements
for compensation for services and all compensation paid as a result of those agreements. These amendments are consistent
with the rules of other self-regulatory organizations. The Board believes that the amendments to the recordkeeping
and record retention requirements related to gifts and gratuities will facilitate dealer compliance with rule G-20,
and assist enforcement agencies in monitoring for compliance with the rule.





The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides
that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Board does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



In January 1994, the Board published for comment the proposed rule change.

3

 The Board received one comment letter that supported the proposed amendments to rules G-8 and G-9 to strengthen
the Board's recordkeeping and record retention requirements.

4








III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption
above and should be submitted by July 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Immediate
Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change Relating to the Termination of the Nasdaq-London Stock Exchange Linkage</DOCTITLE>



June 3, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 26, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the NASD hereby files this proposed rule change to accelerate to June 30, 1994
the termination date of the experimental quotation linkage between the London Stock Exchange (``LSE'') and The Nasdaq
Stock Market (``Nasdaq''), a subsidiary of the NASD. The linkage had been scheduled to terminate on October 31, 1994.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change



On October 2, 1987, the SEC issued an order approving operation of an experimental market linkage between Nasdaq and
LSE (formerly, the International Stock Exchange of The United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) for a pilot term
of two years.
 This linkage supports an interchange of quotation information (``linkage information'') on about 740 securities
(``linkage securities''); of that total, each marketplace has designated approximately half as its ``pilot group''
of linkage securities. NASD and LSE members that function as market makers in one or more of a subset of linkage securities
that are quoted in both the Nasdaq and LSE dealer markets (``common issues'') are entitled to access linkage information
without paying a separate charge to receive it. Operation of the linkage in this fashion comports with the terms of
the Commission's October 1987 Order.





Most recently, the Commission authorized an extension of this pilot linkage through October 31, 1994 by approving
File No. SR-NASD-94-23.
 The latter also stated that the linkage would terminate on or about October 31, 1994. Subsequently, the LSE advised
Nasdaq that it will switch communication carriers at the end of June and that Nasdaq would have to bear the costs of new
communication lines to its processors in Trumbull, Connecticut and Rockville, Maryland. After reviewing the specific
communication requirements and costs, Nasdaq determined to forgo the added communication costs and terminate the
Nasdaq-LSE linkage on June 30, 1994. Therefore, the sole purpose of this rule change is to accelerate the termination
date for the Nasdaq-LSE linkage to June 30, 1994.





The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) and 15A(b)(11)
of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) requires that the NASD's rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues,
fees, and other changes among members or others using any facility or system that the NASD operates or controls. Section
15A(b)(11) authorizes the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations disseminated by member
firms. Termination of the Nasdaq-LSE linkage on June 30, 1994 will obviate the imposition of additional communication
costs (which could not be readily recovered) to support a service that is infrequently used by eligible NASD members
and that duplicates market data offerings by commercial vendors. Similarly, LSE members that wish to receive comprehensive
quotation and transaction information from Nasdaq can easily do so by subscribing to an appropriate vendor service.
From either perspective, a vendor-sponsored service will provide access to more market information than that which
is accessible through the Nasdaq-LSE linkage.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
Rule 19b-4 thereunder because the proposal constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation concerned
solely with the administration of a pilot system whose operation had been extended, on an interim basis, by numerous
rule changes filed by the NASD. In this regard, the establishment of a revised date for terminating this experimental
system is an administrative matter that does not involve the enforcement or interpretation of any NASD rules.

At any time within 60 days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate the rule change if
it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to file number SR-NASD-94-33 and should be submitted by
July 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; New York Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to
the Same-Day Comparison of Initial Trade Data in Listed Stocks Through the NYSE's On-Line Comparison System</DOCTITLE>



June 3, 1994.



On March 10, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSE-94-08) under section 19(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 18, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.






I. Description of the Proposal



The proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to implement its On-Line Comparison System (``OCS''). With OCS, NYSE
clearing members will be able to submit trade data on listed stocks to NYSE on trade date for initial comparison. Implementation
of NYSE's same-day comparison will be in a phased-in approach similar to that which was used to implement next-day
(``T+1'') comparison of NYSE transactions.
 The NYSE's target date for full implementation of trade-date comparison is June 30, 1995. The NYSE filed this proposal
with the Commission to provide the NYSE community with almost eighteen months advance notice in order to afford them
time to plan and implement the operational changes that may be necessary.







Beginning on June 1, 1994, the NYSE will require its member clearing firms to submit to it periodically during the trading
day trade data for transactions in listed stocks, rights, and warrants effected on the NYSE for ``regular way,''
 ``next day,''
 ``cash,''
 and ``seller's option'' settlement.
 Trade data for transactions in listed stocks traded on an ``issued,'' ``when issued,''
 and ``when distributed''
 basis also will have to be submitted periodically during the trading day. The NYSE's existing Overnight Comparison
System will be the main processor of the data submitted for initial comparison. Accordingly, the NYSE has changed
that system's name to the On-Line Comparison System and will continue to use the same acronym of OCS. Compared trades
will be submitted by the NYSE to a ``qualified clearing agency''
 to complete the clearance and settlement process.











Implementation of trade-date comparison will require clearing firms to meet three general requirements. First,
they will have to suppress certain comparison data submissions to qualified clearing agencies as the NYSE locks-in
additional trades. Second, they will have to submit their comparison data to the NYSE for comparison rather than to
a qualified clearing agency. Third, they will have to submit virtually all comparison data to the NYSE during the trading
session rather than after the close of trading.






As mentioned above, the implementation of trade date comparison will use a phased-in approach, which the NYSE found
successful in implementing T+1 overnight comparison. Beginning June 1, 1994, NYSE clearing members will be required
to submit trade data directly to OCS within two hours of trade execution. In August or September of 1994, clearing members
will be required to submit trade data within one hour of execution. In October of 1994, clearing members will be required
to make on-line, real time submissions of trade data. These time frames are flexible and may be altered by the NYSE as
it evaluates clearing firms' abilities to comply. The NYSE intends to monitor closely the implementation of each
phase and will not implement a new phase until it is satisfied that no significant operational problems exist.

II. Discussion



For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act. Section 6(b)(5)
of the Act states that exchange rules should be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged
in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to securities transactions; to remove
impediments to a free and open market; and to protect investors and the public interest.






The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (i.e.,
as long as five business days) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October 1987. The leading studies
of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade processing which, together
with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during the Market Break, posed an unacceptable
threat to the marketplace.
 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts
to compare all trades on trade date.







Since 1988, the NYSE, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated
with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The NYSE reduced its comparison
cycle in stocks first from T+5 in 1990.
 T+1 comparison also was made applicable to NYSE listed options in 1992
 and to NYSE listed bonds in 1993.
 Currently, according to the NYSE, more than seventy-five percent of all trades executed on the NYSE trading floor
are captured and locked-in electronically. The NYSE views the electronic capture of the remaining twenty-five percent
of its trades, which primarily occur in trading crowds on its trading floor, as a major goal of OCS.







The NYSE's main objectives as it moves toward complete implementation of OCS include: (1) Increasing the percentage
of electronically locked-in trades; (2) maintaining a low rate of uncompared trades rate during the various phases
of the project; (3) electronic capture and comparison of trades, especially trading crowd transactions, that currently
are not captured by any electronic order entry system; and (4) elimination of any redundant comparison processing.
Significantly, as the NYSE moves through its various implementation phases of OCS, its current Rule 130 will remain
in operation. That rule requires that each transaction effected on the NYSE be compared or closed out by NYSE's close
of business on T+1.

The required changes may affect numerous clearing and non-clearing firms' operations, including such things as
trading floor operations, purchase and sales department procedures, clearing operations, and internal account
balancing and reconciliation procedures. Because of these significant changes, the NYSE has established two committees,
a steering committee and a working group, to advise it on the best methods by which trade-date comparison may be achieved.
Additionally, this program of trade-date comparison is being implemented in conjunction with the National Securities
Clearing Corporation and the American Stock Exchange, Inc.

As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change, by shortening the NYSE comparison cycle from
T+1 to trade date, will make NYSE's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility
and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that
the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors'
funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental
and important improvements to the marketplace.



III. Conclusion



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly
with sections 6(b)(5) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File
No. SR-NYSE-94-08) be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to
the Eligibility of Certain Securities Guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association</DOCTITLE>


June 3, 1994.



On April 4 1994, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'')
a proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-94-01) pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The proposed rule change allows PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage
Association (``GNMA'')
 as ``eligible securities'' as permitted by PTC's Rules. The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 26, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.







I. Description



The proposed rule change allows PTC to designate certain securities guaranteed by GNMA and eligible securities as
permitted by Article I, Rule 2 of PTC's Rules. PTC currently acts as depository for single-class GNMA I and GNMA II MBS
and REMIC securities
 guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'').







GNMA is now establishing a GNMA REMIC program under which GNMA will guarantee multi-class securities issued by REMIC
trusts. The GNMA REMIC securities will be issued through single-purpose trusts created by GNMA-approved sponsors
which will assemble GNMA-guaranteed single-class mortgage-backed securities to constitute the corpus of the REMIC
trust. The sponsors will be private-sector entities such as investment bankers. Upon issuance, the General Counsel
of HUD will render an opinion that GNMA's obligations under the GNMA guarantee of its REMIC securities will constitute
absolute and unconditional general obligations of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United
States is pledged.

The authorizing Federal statute
 provides that the GNMA REMIC program be implemented by GNMA's publication of a notice in the 

Federal Register

, and that GNMA subsequently publish regulations within twelve moths of the publication of the initial notice, based
upon the comments received and the experience of GNMA in carrying out the program.





GNMA will implement its REMIC program in two stages. During the initial stage, GNMA will restrict participation in
the REMIC program to a small number of participants (consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel,
and accounting firms) and a limited number of REMIC issuances. The initial stage will commence upon the closing of
the first transaction, after publication of the notice in the 

Federal Register

, and is expected to last several months, during which time GNMA will establish standard documentation, and guidelines
and procedures applicable to the full implementation of the REMIC program.






While GNMA has not yet determined the characteristics of the GNMA REMIC tranches, for processing purposes it is assumed
that the GNMA REMIC classes will have the same basic processing requirements as the VA REMICs, which PTC has had on deposit
for approximately the last two years. It is assumed that, as in the case with the VA REMIC securities, all classes of
the GNMA REMIC securities except the residual class will be established and maintained in book-entry form through
the facilities of PRTC, although holders will have the right to request certificated securities.



II. Discussion



The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act,
 and in particular, section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency
be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that PTC's proposal to designate certain securities
guaranteed by GNMA as eligible securities for deposit with PTC is consistent with this goal.





As previously stated, REMIC issuances will be limited during the initial stage of the program. Once the REMIC program
is fully established, however, GNMA anticipates that a substantial percentage of its annual production of GNMA single-class
securities will be securitized in GNMA REMICs. GNMA has stated they anticipate approximately $75 billion is the average
deal size, this will result in approximately 150 REMIC deals issued each year.

It is anticipated that each class of the GNMA REMIC securities will be issued initially in the form of one or more physical
certificates registered in the name of MBSCC & Co., nominee for PTC, and held in physical form by PTC's custodian,
with participants receiving and delivering REMIC securities by book-entry on PTC's books. REMIC securities may
be held subsequent to original issuance in either certificated form, outside of PTC, or on PTC's book-entry system,
as is currently the case with the GNMA I and GNMA II single-class MBS and the VA REMIC securities on deposit at PTC. PTC's
current custody agreement with its custodian, Chemical Bank, accommodates the deposit of GMNA REMIC securities
with the custodian.

The REMIC securities will be supported entirely by the cash flows on the underlying GMA-guaranteed GNMA I MBS. REMIC
trustees will be required to pay principal and interest (``P&I'') on the REMIC securities in same day funds on
the 16th day of the month, or the first business day thereafter if the 16th is not a business day. REMIC P&I will therefore
be paid to REMIC holders on the same day that the PSI on the underlying MBS is paid to MBS holders. PTC will pass through
the REMIC payment on the same day as received.

Not later than the 14th day of each month, the trustee will deliver to PTC and Chemical Bank the factor information for
payment on the REMIC securities. PTC will follow the instructions from the trustee for disbursement of funds received
on the GNMA MBS collateralizing the REMIC trust.

The volume of the GNMA REMIC securities initially deposited at FTC will be modest compared to the total face amount
of GNMA securities now on deposit at FTC and is expected to have a comparably small impact on FTC's overall transaction
volume.
 GNMA I's that constitute the corpus of a GNMA REMIC trust will remain immobilized at FTC and, therefore, will be removed
from FTC's transaction volume after the creation of the REMIC.





It is expected that FTC will utilize pricing sources and the methodology employed for the VA REMIC pricing at FTC for
the GNMA REMIC product.
 As an eligible security, functionally and legally comparable to GNMA single-class and VA REMIC securities, PTC's
Rules and procedures are currently consistent with, and govern PTC's and it's participants' rights and obligations
with respect to, the GNMA REMIC securities. PTC end of day borrowing agreements also currently apply to GNMA REMIC
securities without the change. Finally, PTC anticipates that the fees imposed by PTC for providing depository services
for GNMA REMIC securities will be the same as those in effect for GNMA MBS.





PTC has gained almost six years of experience with GNMAs. The Commission believes that PTC's experience with GNMAs
serves as a good foundation for continuing to handle REMICs. In addition, PTC has been accepting VA REMICS for deposit
for almost two years. PTC's experience with the VA REMIC program has provided a basis for determining the depository
services which will be required for the GNMA REMIC. The Commission therefore believes that this proposal furthers
the perfection of the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions becuase GNMA REMIC
will be processed within a centralized, electronic book-entry environment.



III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, and in
particular with section 17A of the act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder.



It Is Therefore Ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PTC-94-01) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Adopting Rule 1015, Quotation Guarantees, Including a Trade or Fade Provision</DOCTITLE>


June 3, 1994



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and the Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b-4 of the Act, proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 1015 relating to quotation guarantees,
to mirror the text of Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A-11, with the addition of a ``trade or fade'' provision.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements Regarding the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change



Currently, Rule 1033(a) states that all bids/offers in Phlx equity/index options are deemed to be for one contract,
unless otherwise specified; in addition, specialists and Registered Options Traders (``ROTs'') are required to
fill public orders to a minimum depth of ten contracts at the best quoted bid/offer. Consequently, orders for public
customers are provided with preferential treatment not afforded to other types of orders.

The Phlx proposes to adopt a ``trade or fade'' provision comparable to the proposals of the other options exchanges
for the handling of orders other than public customer orders.

Specifically, when a non-public order is represented in the trading crowd at the displayed market on the Exchange,
the trading crowd would be required to either satisfy the order at that price or better, or fade (withdraw) to a newly
disseminated price. If the quote is faded, immediate re-display of the previously disseminated quote without a change
in market conditions to warrant such action would be considered conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade,
 which could result in an Exchange disciplinary proceeding. For purposes of this rule, non-public orders include
broker-dealer orders and that portion of customer orders exceeding the contract size guaranteed by the respective
crowd.





The proposed rule is similar to proposals of other option exchanges in that it would expressly require the members
of an options trading crowd to respond to non-public orders represented in that trading crowd by either satisfying
the order or updating the market in that option series.

The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5),
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,
as well as to protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the Phlx consents, the Commission will:

(A) by order approve such proposed rule change, or,

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Phlx-94-30
and should be submitted by July 1, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

Shipping Coordinating Committee; Notice of Meeting 



The Working Group on Lifesaving, Search and Rescue of the Subcommittee on Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) will conduct
an open meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, June 17, 1994 in room 1103 at Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW.,
Washington, DC. 

The purpose of the meeting is to review the outcome of the 25th Session of the International Maritime Organization
(IMO) Sub-Committee on Lifesaving, Search and Rescue (LSR), held April 11-15, 1994, at the IMO Headquarters
in London, and to begin planning of action items for the next session. Specific items to be discussed include: 

 


_Amendments to SOLAS Chapter III approved by the LSR Sub-Committee for forwarding to the Maritime Safety Committee
(MSC) for adoption

_Draft revisions to the Recommendation on Testing and Evaluation of Life-Saving Appliances, including new sections
on marine evacuation systems and ``anti-exposure suits,'' and a draft proposal for inflatable liferaft fabric requirements


_Amendments to MSC Circular 617 on Guidelines for Passenger Safety Instructions, and a working paper on guidelines
for emergency escape arrangements on passenger ships 

_Information concerning the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) ``Scheme for the Reciprocal Recognition of
Tests and Inspections carried out Ships' Equipment'' 

 


The IMO LSR Sub-Committee works to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for Search and Rescue
and for lifesaving equipment installed on commercial ships. Because of the potential impact of the Sub-Committee's
work on U.S. regulations and standards, the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime
industry to express their ideas in the areas under the Sub-Committee's purview. Members of the public may attend this
meeting up to the seating capacity of the room. Due to unforeseen administrative delays, the notice of this meeting
is being published late. The Committee apologizes for any inconvenience.

Notice of Proposed Modification of Airport Improvement Program Grant Assurances


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), (DOT).




</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FAA proposes to modify the standard grant assurances required of a sponsor receiving a grant under the Airport
Improvement Program (AIP). This modification is due to changes in existing legislation. The Secretary of Transportation
is required to provide notice in the 

Federal Register 

and an opportunity for the public to comment upon proposals to modify assurances or to require any additional assurances
under AIP pursuant to subsection 511(f) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Secretary must receive certain assurances from a sponsor (applicant) under the Airport and Airway Improvement
Act of 1982, as amended. These assurances are submitted as part of a sponsor's application for Federal Assistance
and are incorporated in all grant agreements. The current assurances were published on February 3, 1988, at 53 FR 3104
and amended on September 6, 1988, at 53 FR 34361, and on August 29, 1989, at 54 FR 35748. As need dictates, these assurances
are modified from time to time to reflect new Federal requirements. Notice of such proposed modifications are published
in the 

Federal Register 

and an opportunity provided for comment by the public. FAA is planning to modify the assurances currently in use to
reflect some changes in the general requirements.




FAA uses three separate sets of standard assurances: Airport Sponsors (owners/operators); Planning Agency Sponsors;
and Nonairport Sponsors Undertaking Noise Compatibility Program Projects (herein after referred to as Nonairport
Sponsor Assurances).

Assurance 1, General Federal Requirements, of the Airport Sponsor Assurances and Nonairport Sponsor Assurances
is modified to add Executive Order 12699_Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted New Building Construction,
to the Executive Orders section of both sets of assurances. Further, Assurance 1 is modified to add 49 CFR part 41, Seismic
safety of Federal and federally assisted or regulated new building construction, to the Federal Regulations section
of both sets of assurances.

Assurance 1 is also modified to add 49 CFR Part 20, New restrictions on lobbying, to the Federal Regulations section
of all three sets of assurances. The addition of this regulation will alleviate the need for project sponsors to file
with the FAA, a separate certification stating that they have not made, and will not make, any payment prohibited by
paragraph (a),  20.100 of 49 CFR part 20. A disclosure of lobbying activities form, however, must still be filed
with the FAA if required by paragraph (c),  20.100 of 49 CFR part 20.

Assurance 1 of all three sets of assurances is also modified to correct the titles of certain Federal Regulations.

Assurance 9 of the Airport Sponsor Assurances has been rewritten to incorporate the provision of Public Law 102-581,
which requires the sponsor to certify that the airport management board either has voting representation from the
communities where the project is located or has advised the communities that they have the right to petition the Secretary
concerning a proposed project.

Assurance 23 of the Airport Sponsor Assurances has been rewritten to bring this assurance into conformance with section
511(a)(2) of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982, as amended.

Assurance 26 of the Airport Sponsor Assurances has been rewritten to incorporate the provision of Public Law 102-581,
which requires that the airport sponsor assure that a report of the airport budget is available to the public at reasonable
times and places.

Assurance 31 of the Airport Sponsor Assurances, and Assurance 20 of the Nonairport Sponsor Assurances, titled Disposal
of Land, have been rewritten to incorporate the provisions of Public Law 101-236, which relaxed the requirement
that an airport sponsor must dispose of land which was originally acquired with Federal grant funds for airport development
purposes but is no longer needed for such purposes.

Assurance 36 of the Airport Sponsor Assurances, Assurance 13 of the Planning Agency Sponsor Assurances, and Assurance
22 of the Nonairport Sponsor Assurances have been deleted. The grant applicant's requirements for compliance are
set forth in the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988_41 U.S.C. 702 through 706 and 49 CFR Part 29_Governmentwide debarment
and suspension (non-procurement) and governmentwide requirements for drug-free workplace (grants), which are
included in Assurance 1. Therefore a separate assurance detailing these requirements is unnecessary.

to the Secretary. Further, for such projects, it has on its management board either voting representation from the
communities where the project is located or has advised the communities that they have the right to petition the Secretary

For purposes of this paragraph, the providing of the services at an airport by a single fixed-based operator shall
not be construed as an exclusive right if both of the following apply:

a. It would be unreasonably costly, burdensome, or impractical for more than one fixed-based operator to provide
such services, and

b. If allowing more than one fixed-based operator to provide such services would require the reduction of space leased
pursuant to an existing agreement between such single fixed-based operator and such airport.

It further agrees that it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm, or corporation,
the exclusive right at the airport to conduct any aeronautical activities, including, but not limited to charter
flights, pilot training, aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting, aerial advertising
and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether
or not conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft
parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of aircraft can be regarded
as an aeronautical activity, and that it will terminate any exclusive right to conduct an aeronautical activity now
existing at such an airport before the grant of any assistance under the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982.

d. Assurance 26 is revised to read:

26. Reports and Inspections. It will submit to the Secretary such annual or special financial and operations reports
as the Secretary may reasonably request. A report of the airport budget will be available to the public at reasonable
times and places. For airport development projects, it will also make the airport and all airport records and documents
affecting the airport, including deeds, leases, operation and use agreements, regulations and other instruments,
available for inspection by any duly authorized agent of the Secretary upon reasonable request. For noise compatibility
program projects, it will also make records and documents relating to the project and continued compliance with the
terms, conditions, and assurances of the grant agreement including deeds, leases, agreements, regulations, and
other instruments, available for inspection by any duly authorized agent of the Secretary upon reasonable request.

e. Assurance 31 is revised to read:

31. Disposal of Land.

a. For land purchased under a grant for airport noise compatibility purposes, it will dispose of the land, when the
land is no longer needed for such purposes, at fair market value, at the earliest practicable time. That portion of
the proceeds of such disposition which is proportionate to the United States' share of acquisition of such land will,
at the discretion of the Secretary, (1) be paid to the Secretary for deposit in the Trust Fund, or (2) be reinvested in
an approved noise compatibility project as prescribed by the Secretary.

b. (1) For land purchased under a grant for airport development purposes (other than noise compatibility), it will,
when the land is no longer needed for airport purposes, dispose of such land at fair market value or make available to
the Secretary an amount equal to the United States' proportionate share of the fair market value of the land. That portion
of the proceeds of such disposition which is proportionate to the United States' share of the cost of acquisition of
such land will, (a) upon application to the Secretary, be reinvested in another eligible airport improvement project
or projects approved by the Secretary at that airport or within the national airport system, or (b) be paid to the Secretary
for deposit in the Trust Fund if no eligible project exists.

(2) Land shall be considered to be needed for airport purposes under this assurance if (a) it may be needed for aeronautical
purposes (including runway protection zones) or serve as noise buffer land, and (b) the revenue from interim uses
of such land contributes to the financial self-sufficiency of the airport. Further, land purchased with a grant received
by an airport operator or owner before December 31, 1987, will be considered to be needed for airport purposes if the
Secretary or Federal agency making such grant before December 31, 1987, was notified by the operator or owner of the
uses of such land, did not object to such use, and the land continues to be used for that purpose, such use having commenced
no later than December 15, 1989.

c. Disposition of such land under (a) or (b) will be subject to the retention or reservation of any interest or right
therein necessary to ensure that such land will only be used for purposes which are compatible with noise levels associated
with operation of the airport.

f. Assurance 36 is deleted:

36. Drug-Free Workplace. It will provide a drug-free workplace at the site of work specified in the grant application
in accordance with 49 CFR part 29 by (1) publishing a statement notifying its employees that the unlawful manufacture,
distribution, dispensing, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the sponsor's workplace
and specifying the action that will be taken against its employees for violation of such prohibition; (2) establishing
a drug-free awareness program to inform its employees about the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace and any available
drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employees' assistance programs; (3) notifying the FAA within 10 days after
receiving notice of an employee criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace; and
(4) making a good faith effort to maintain a drug-free workplace.

for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before November 23, 1994.
This notice also announces the availability of this revision for public review and comment.





An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.

The FAA has formally received the second revision to the approved noise compatibility program for Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport, effective on May 27, 1994. It was requested that the FAA review this material and that the noise
mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise
compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. On April 2, 1990, the FAA approved the noise compatibility
program for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. An announcement of FAA's approval of the noise compatibility
program was published in the 

Federal Register 

on May 1, 1990. Revision Number 1 to the approved noise compatibility program was approved by the FAA on August 14, 1992.
An announcement of FAA's approval of the Revision Number 1 was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 14, 1992. Preliminary review of the submitted material for the second revision indicates that it conforms
to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary
prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will
be completed on or before November 23, 1994.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measure may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.

Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed revision with specific reference to these factors. All
comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent
practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed second revision
to the approved noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations:




Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., room 617, Washington, DC 20591.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the Director of Aviation Planning for Seattle-Tocoma International Airport under the provisions of Title I of
the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150. These findings are made
in recognition of the description of Federal and non-Federal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980).



On April 15, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure maps submitted by the Director of Aviation Planning under
Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On May 18, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports
approved the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport noise compatibility program. All of the program elements were
approved.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport, effective May 18, 1994. Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act
of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act'', an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure
map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport
operator for the reduction of existing noncompatibility land uses and prevention of additional noncompatibile
land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps. The Act requires such a program to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties including the state, local communities, government agencies, airport users,
and FAA personnel.



Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 150
is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types of classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and 
d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
Far part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where Federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Airports District Office in Seattle, Washington.
The Port of Seattle submitted to the FAA the noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced
during the noise compatibility planning study conducted at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on April 15, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 27, 1993.
The Seattle-Tacoma International Airport noise compatibility program contains a proposed noise compatibility
program comprised of actions designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions
from the date of study completion to the year 1996. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material
as a noise compatibility program as described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on
November 19, 1993 and was required by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other
than the use of new flight procedures for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the
180-day period shall be deemed to be an approval of such program.

The submitted program contained 10 proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The FAA completed
its review and determination that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR 150 have been satisfied.
The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective May 18, 1994.


These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on May 18, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and the documents comprising that submittal,
are available for review at the FAA office listed above and at the administrative offices of the Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.

Notice of establishment of the Braking Systems Harmonization Working Group.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of the establishment of the Braking Systems Harmonization Working Group by the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 22, 1991 (56 FR 2190), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). The committee provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator, through
the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification, on the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activities
with respect to aviation-related issues.




In order to develop such advice and recommendations, the ARAC may choose to establish working groups to which specific
tasks are assigned. Such working groups are comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the
assigned tasks. A working group member need not be a representative of the full committee. Recently the ARAC established
the Braking Systems Harmonization Working Group.

The FAA announced at the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA)-Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Harmonization
Conference in Toronto, Canada June 2-5, 1992 that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing
objective to ``harmonize'' the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).



Tasks



The Braking Systems Harmonization Working Group is charged with recommending to the ARAC new or revised requirements
for approval of brakes installed on transport category airplanes. The product of this exercise is intended to be a
harmonized standard, acceptable to both the FAA and the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA).



Reports




The Braking Systems Harmonization Working Group should develop and present to the ARAC:

1. A recommended work plan for completion of the task, including the rationale supporting such plan, for consideration
at the meeting of the ARAC to consider transport airplane and engine issues held following publication of this notice;

2. A detailed conceptual presentation on the proposed recommendation(s), prior to proceeding with the work stated
in item 3. below;

3. A draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), with supporting economic and other required analyses, and/or any
other related guidance material or collateral documents the working group determines to be appropriate; or, if new
or revised requirements or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the rationale for not making
such recommendations; and 

4. A status report at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider transport airplane and engine issues.



Participation in Working Group Task



An individual who has expertise in the subject matter and wishes to become a member of the working group should write
to the person listed under the caption 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 expressing that desire, describing his or her interest in the task and stating the expertise he or she would bring to
the working group. The request will be reviewed with the assistant chairman and working group leader, and the individual
will be advised whether or not the request can be accommodated.

The Secretary of Transportation has determined that the information and use of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory
Committee are necessary in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on the FAA by law.
Meetings of the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee will be open to the public, except as authorized by section
10(d) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Meetings of the working group will not be open to the public, except to
the extent that individuals with an interest and expertise are selected to participate. No public announcement of
working group meetings will be made.

SUMMARY: 

Notice is given of new task assignments for the Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group of the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On January 22, 1991 (56 FR 2190), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). The committee provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator, through
the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification, on the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activities
with respect to aviation-related issues..




In order to develop such advice and recommendations, the ARAC may choose to establish working groups to which specific
tasks are assigned. Such working groups are comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the
assigned tasks. A working group member need not be a representative of the full committee. One of the working groups
established by the ARAC is the Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group.
The FAA announced at the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA)-Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Harmonization
Conference in Toronto, Canada June 2-5, 1992, that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing
objective to ``harmonize'' the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).


Tasks


The Loads and Dynamics Harmonization Working Group's tasks are as follows:


Task 1_Interaction of Systems and Structure:

 Review existing special conditions for fly-by-wire airplanes and existing requirements for control systems, including
automatic and/or power-operated systems, and recommend to the ARAC any new revised general requirements needed
for flight control systems and structures affected by those systems (  25.302, 25.671, 25.1329, part
25 appendix K).


Task 2_Continuous Turbulence Loads:

 Review the requirement for the continuous turbulence standard in light of the ARAC proposal for a tuned discrete gust
requirement in order to determine whether the continuous turbulence requirement should be revised or removed from
the FAR/JAR for better consistency with the new proposed tuned discrete gust criteria ( 25.305(d)).


Task 3_Strength and Deformation:

 Review the recent requirements adopted in the FAR by Amendment 25-77 (for the design of transport airplanes
against buffet and forced structural vibrations) and consider appropriate changes for the JAR and FAR to harmonize
these rules (  25.305 (e) and (f)).


Task 4_Design Flap Speeds:

 Review the current flap design loads requirements to resolve differences in interpretation between the FAA and JAA
concerning the structural design stall speeds on which the flap design speeds are based. Recent measurements of gust
speeds at low altitudes, where flaps are normally extended, indicate a more severe gust environment may be present.
Review all aspects of the flap design load requirements, including the design airspeeds, vertical and head-on design
gust criteria, and the effects of automatic retraction and load relief systems ( 25.335(e)).


Task 5_Residual Strength Loads for Damage Tolerance:

 Review the differences in residual strength design load requirements between the FAR and JAR and resolve differences
to harmonize this rule. Prepare a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or make recommendations to other ARAC efforts concerning
FAR  25.571, so that they can be included in rulemaking that may be forthcoming from those efforts ( 25.571(b)).


Task 6_Shock Absorption Tests:

 Review the changes recently introduced into the JAR that have resulted in differences between the FAR and JAR in regard
to the requirement for shock absorption tests. Review those changes in view of harmonizing the FAR and JAR ( 25.723(a)).


Task 7_Rough Air Speed:

 The ARAC has proposed a new  25.1517 concerning rough air speed design standards in its proposal for a tuned discrete
gust requirement. This action is harmonized with the current JAR 25.1517; however, further changes in the rough air
speed requirement may be needed in both the FAR and JAR. Review JAR 25.1517 and the new proposed FAR 25.1517 to determine
if further changes are needed. If so, prepare a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or, if possible, combine these changes
with other rulemaking efforts ( 25.1517).


Task 8_Taxi, Takeoff, and Landing Roll:

 Prepare an advisory circular that establishes criteria that may be used to calculate rough runway and taxiway loads,
as required by   25.491, 25.235, and 25.305.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Impact Statement: Carroll, Lafayette, and Saline Counties, Missouri</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
project in Carroll, Lafayette, and Saline Counties, Missouri.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve U.S. Route 65 in Carroll, Lafayette, and Saline Counties, Missouri.



1. The proposed improvement would involve the reconstruction of U.S. Route 65 from immediately south of Marshall
to just north of Carrollton. The project would be approximately 54.7 kilometers (34 miles) long. Improvements in
the corridor are considered necessary to (1) provide additional capacity in the U.S. Route 65 regional corridor between
the Iowa and Arkansas state lines to accommodate increasing traffic, and (2) improve regional mobility and connections
to major linkages within the corridor. The U.S. route 65 corridor is the only mid-state, continuous, north-south
corridor across Missouri. This proposal also includes the replacement of a functionally obsolete bridge across
the Missouri River.

2. Alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option; (2) using alternative travel modes; (3) phased
construction of a four-lane freeway, with fully controlled access, substantially parallel to the existing route;
(4) phased construction of a four-lane freeway substantially parallel to the existing route on a new location; and
(5) phased construction of a four-lane freeway in an alternative corridor between Carrollton and Marshall.

3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping
process has been initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. Formal agency and public scoping meetings will
be held. In addition, public hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance of the date and time of each
meeting. The draft EIS will be available prior to the public hearing for public review and comment. To ensure that the
full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments
and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action
and the EIS should be directed to the FHW or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the address provided
above.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for a proposed
project in Clark and Lewis Counties, Missouri, and Henry and Lee Counties, Iowa.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD), will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a portion of U.S. Route 61 (the Avenue of the Saints roadway) in Clark
and Lewis Counties, Missouri, and Henry and Lee Counties, Iowa.


1. The proposed improvement would provide a four-lane highway from Canton, Missouri, to approximately 1.61 kilometers
(1 mile) south of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. The project is approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles) long. The Missouri Section
would be an expressway on expressway right of way, with freeway and interchange right of way purchased at major state
routes. It would run for 37 kilometers (23 miles) along the corridor of existing portions of U.S. 61, U.S. 136 Spur,
U.S. 136, and Missouri Route B. The Iowa section would be designed to expressway standards and would generally follow
U.S. 218 and Iowa 394 for 53 kilometers (33 miles). The corridor crosses the Des Moines River and includes the crossing
now occupied by Iowa 394 and Missouri Route B. However, the new crossing will be at a different location. Several wetland
areas associated with rivers and streams will be crossed.
2. In Missouri, alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing
alignment, and (3) two alternatives on new alignments.
The first Missouri alternate on new alignment would begin north of the junction on U.S. 61 and Missouri 16, just west
of Canton, and would extend along a new alignment west of U.S. 61 and generally west of U.S. 136 Spur. It would provide
a western bypass around Wayland, Missouri, and continue northwest to Missouri Route B. St. Francisville, Missouri,
would be bypassed on the west.
The second Missouri alternative on new alignment would also begin north of the U.S. 61 and Missouri 16 junction and
would extend north on an alignment east of U.S. 61 and U.S. 136 Spur. It would bypass Wayland and continue north to Missouri
Route B. South of St. Francisville, it would cross Route B and bypass St. Francisville to the east. Within Missouri,
combinations of build alternatives are possible.
In Iowa, alternatives being considered include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing alignment,
and (3) a construction alternative that includes some sections on new alignment combined with upgrading the existing
alignment. This alternative consists of improving existing two-lane sections of U.S. 218 and Iowa 394 to four-lane
expressway standards with eastern bypasses of the communities of Donnellson and Argyle.
3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping
process was initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies in September of 1993. Formal agency and public scoping
meetings were held on October 12, 1993, in Donnellson, Iowa. A meeting with local government officials and community
leaders was held in Wayland, Missouri, on February 8, 1994. On February 24, 1994, a second public information meeting
was held near Wayland to gain public input about alternatives being considered for the project. In addition, public
hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance of the date and time of each meeting. The draft EIS will
be available prior to the public hearing for public review and comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related
to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited
from all interested parties. Any comments or questions concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed
to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department at the addresses provided above. Missouri is the
lead state for the proposed action.

Program Plan for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Existing Regulations, 1994-98



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of its Evaluation Program Plan for 1994-98. The report describes
the agency's ongoing and planned evaluations of its existing Federal Vehicle Safety Standards [49 CFR part 571] and
its other safety and consumer programs. It also summarizes the results of completed evaluations. The agency's evaluation
program responds to Executive Order 12866, which provides for Government-wide review of existing significant Federal
regulations. This notice solicits public review and comment on the evaluation plan. Comments received will be used
to improve the plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

NHTSA has rigorously evaluated its major programs as a matter of policy since 1970. The evaluation of the effectiveness
of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) began in 1975. Executive Order 12866, issued in October 1993,
is the formal government-wide requirement for Federal agencies to evaluate their existing regulations and programs.
Since the mid-1970's NHTSA was a leader among Federal agencies in evaluating the effectiveness of its regulations.
There are large data bases of motor vehicle accidents which can be analyzed to find out what vehicle and traffic safety
programs works best.



This five-year plan presents and discusses the programs, regulations, and related areas NHTSA proposes to evaluate,
and it summarizes the findings of past evaluations. Depending on scope, evaluations typically take a year or more,
counting initial planning, contracting for support, Office of Management and Budget clearance for surveys, internal
review, approval, report publication for comment, and the last phase of preparing options for subsequent agency
action. 

Most of NHTSA's crashworthiness and several crash avoidance standards have been evaluated at least once since 1975.
A number of consumer-oriented regulations, e.g., bumpers, theft protection, and fuel economy, have also been evaluated.
The plan for the next five years includes evaluations of new and existing safety and consumer information and protection
regulations, plus assessments of specific enforcement and highway safety programs. 

NHTSA welcomes public review of the plan and invites the reviewers to comment about the selection, priority, and schedule
of the regulations to be evaluated. The agency is interested in learning of any additional data that may be useful in
the evaluations. The plan will be periodically updated in response to public and agency needs, with a complete revision
scheduled very four years.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a self-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will
return the postcard by mail.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice is to advise interested persons that RSPA will conduct a public meeting to discuss issues to be considered
at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Technical Committee Meeting (TCM) during June 27-July 1,
1994. A TCM is a meeting of experts from member nations assembled to address the technical aspects of a particular proposal.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This meeting will be held to discuss several issues being considered for incorporation into the next publication
of international regulations. The IAEA meeting will be held in Vienna, Austria, June 27-July 1, 1994. Topics
to be covered include:



1. The impact of the new recommendations proposed by the International Council on Radiological Protection (ICRP)
and the draft of the IAEA Basic Safety Standards on the ``Regulations for Safe Transport of Radioactive Material,''
IAEA Safety Series 

#

6.

2. Review status of changes to the ``Q'' System. The ``Q'' system is an index of the relative hazards of each radionuclide,
and is the basis for determining such issues as Type A and Type B quantities.

3. Exemption/Exception criteria. The issue is to investigate the merits of replacing the current generic radioactivity
threshold of .002 uCi/g of any radionuclide with a threshold based on each individual radionuclide.

4. Minimum weight limit for packages labeled ``Radioactive Yellow III''. The proposal is to require a minimum weight
of 10 kg for these packages.

The public is invited to attend without prior notification.



Documents



Copies of documents related to the issues to be covered at the tenth meeting of SAGSTRAM may be obtained from RSPA. Documents
may be ordered by contacting RSPA's Dockets Unit (202-366-4453). For more information on the use of the
HMIX system, contact the HMIX information center; 1-800-PLANFOR (752-6367); in Illinois, 1-800-367-9592;
Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central time.

An ideal program would provide a state-of-the-art advising center dedicated to providing information, orientation,
and advice to international students in Hong Kong interested in studying in the U.S.



Guidelines



The proposal should be presented in three parts.



I. Applicant's Background and Overview



The first part should contain an overview of the applicant's history and purpose. Evidence of previous experience
with advising or educational exchange of international students and scholars should be included. The overview should
indicate the total amount of funding requested with a justification as well as a budget presentation outlining the
total project costs.

A listing of names, titles, addresses, and telephone numbers of the executive officer(s) and of the person(s) ultimately
responsible for project, must be included in the proposal. Resumes or vitae of key personnel must be provided. USIA
also recommends the inclusion of brochures and general information concerning the applicant, e.g. organizational
charts, job descriptions, the names of board members (or similar group), the number of employees, etc.



II. Advising Center Operational and Services



The second part of the proposal should contain details on the advising center's proposed location and hours of operation,
proposed staffing pattern (including the percentage of time each employee will devote to advising activities and
a description of their functions and responsibilities), budget, and advising services to be provided. A resume or
brief narrative explaining the qualifications of the person or persons who will have primary responsibility for
conducting advising and/or providing oversight of the advising center staff should be included. The proposal should
demonstrate the center's ability to provide the following educational advising services to international students
and scholars:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00193 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00099 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Information on English language training programs in the U.S.;

5. Group and individual advising sessions, pre-departure orientation and reentry programs, as appropriate.

The center will also be required to monitor the status of the educational system in Hong Kong and to share that information
with USIA and United States Information Service (USIS) office at the American Consulate. The applicant should be
willing to assist and support educational outreach activities of the USIS post abroad by developing a network of contacts
with the local Ministry of Education, universities, and other appropriate institutions.

The center should also be willing to serve as an information resource for overseas educational advising centers in
the People's Republic of China. The proposal should address the applicant's ability to do so.



III. Provision of Resource Materials, Equipment and Training



The third part of the proposal should address the extent to which the U.S. headquarters office will support its advising
center abroad through the provision of educational advising resource materials and professional development activities
and training.

Student access to a comprehensive university catalog collection, in print and/or microfiche or computer software
programs, and an extensive collection of current references on U.S. educational institutions and programs, through
print or computer networks, is an integral component of an educational advising center and the applicant's ability
to provide such should be made clear in this section.

Office equipment that facilitates the processing of inquiries, such as electronic mail, facsimile machines, and
telexes, would be regarded as an asset to the advising function and mention of such equipment should be made in the proposal.
The Agency expects the advising center to be equipped with audio visual aids for students' use. Videos on U.S. study
and life should complement the presentation and materials offered at group and individual advising sessions.



Proposed Budget



Applicants must submit a comprehensive line-item budget for which specific details are available in the application
packet. The budget should not exceed $90,000.

Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as cost to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost sharing and
matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost-sharing
as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's
contribution.

The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.
92-9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental
schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133,
AICPA SOP 92-9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

Applicants should refer to the application package for a list of allowable costs.

<DOCTITLE>Educational Advising Program for International Students From Mexico and a Regional Educational Advising Consultancy
for Overseas Educational Advising Centers Throughout Central America</DOCTITLE>




<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_Request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Information Agency (USIA) seeks applications
from non-profit applicants willing to establish and maintain an educational advising center in Mexico City which
would also serve as the Regional Educational Advising Consultancy (REAC) for overseas educational advising centers
throughout Mexico and Central America. The advising center will facilitate international educational exchange
through overseas educational advising, orientation, and information services for international students and
scholars seeking information on opportunities in U.S. higher education.


USIA anticipates awarding up to $130,000 for the implementation and coordination of the advising center and the REAC.
Grants will only be awarded to eligible applications with at least four years of experience in conducting international
exchange programs.




Announcement Name and Number




All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/ASA-94-03.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life.




Overall authority for this program is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended,
Pub. L. 87-256 (Fulbright Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is to ``enable the Government of the United States
to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries; to strengthen
the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating the educational and cultural interests, developments,
and achievements of the people of the United States and other nations and thus to assist in the development of friendly,
sympathetic and peaceful relations between the United States and the other countries of the world.'' Programs and
projects must conform with all Agency requirements and guidelines and are subject to final review by the USIA contracting
officer.




Overview





An ideal program would provide a state-of-the-art advising center dedicated to providing information, orientation,
and advice to international students in Mexico interested in study in the U.S. and would also serve as a well informed
resource on U.S. education to overseas educational advisers throughout Mexico and Central America.




Guidelines





The proposal should be presented in four parts.




I. Applicant's Background and Overview



The first part should contain an overview of the applicant's history and purpose. Evidence of previous experience
with advising or educational exchange of international students and scholars should be included. The overview should
indicate the total amount of funding requested with a justification as well as a budget presentation outlining the
total project costs.

<DOCNO> FR940610-2-00196 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940610-2-00100 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A listing of names, titles, addresses, and telephones numbers of the executive officer(s) and of the person(s) ultimately
responsible for project, must be included in the proposal. R&eacute;sum&eacute;s or vitae of key personnel must
be provided. USIA also recommends the inclusion of brochures and general information concerning the applicant,
e.g. organizational charts, job descriptions, the names of board members (or similar group), the number of employees,
etc.






II. Advising Center Operation and Services




The second part of the proposal should contain details on the advising center's proposed location and hours of operation,
proposed staffing pattern (including the percentage of time each employee will devote to advising activities and
a description of their functions and responsibilities), budget, and advising services to be provided. A resume or
brief narrative explaining the qualifications of the person or persons who will have primary responsibility for
conducting, advising and/or providing oversight of the advising center staff should be included. The proposal should
demonstrate the center's ability to provide the following educational advising services to international students
and scholars:



1. Information and guidance on U.S. educational institutions, systems, tuition and related costs, fields of study,
specialized training, etc;



2. Information and advice on U.S. standardized tests, e.g. TOEFL, GRE, GMAT, FMGEMS, etc., to include the provision
of registration application forms, maintenance of bulletins and testing schedules;



3. Information and research on short-term institutional training in technical and professional fields;



4. Information on English language training programs in the U.S.;






5. Group and individual advising sessions, pre-departure orientation and reentry programs, as appropriate.


The center will also be required to monitor the status of the educational system in Mexico and to share that information
with USIA and United States Information Service (USIS) office at the American Embassy. The applicant should also
be willing to assist and support educational outreach activities of the USIS post abroad by developing a network of
contacts with the local Ministry of Education, universities, and other appropriate institutions.




III. Provision of Resource Materials, Equipment and Training





The third part of the proposal should address the extent to which the U.S. headquarters office will support its advising
center abroad through the provision of educational advising resource materials and professional development activities
and training.


Student access to a comprehensive university catalog collection, in print and/or microfiche, and an extensive collection
of current references on U.S. educational institutions and programs is an integral component of an educational advising
center and the applicant's ability to provide such should be made clear in this section.




Office equipment that facilitate the processing of inquiries, such as electronic mail, facsimile machines, and
telexes, would be regarded as an asset to the advising function and mention of such equipment should be made in the proposal.
The Agency expects the advising center to be equipped with audio visual aids for students' use. Videos on U.S. study
and life complement the presentation and materials offered at group and individual advising sessions.

Mexico and Central America. Funding for the REAC should be contained within the $130,000 budget. The Agency recommends
that the person(s) dedicated to the REAC work a minimum of 20 hours per week. The REAC would service overseas educational
advising centers in Mexico and Central America. The objective of the REAC is to:

1. Attain widespread recognition as the regional resource center for educational advising;

2. Encourage regional communication and networking among Mexican and Central American advising centers;

3. Foster information sharing through such means as the development and sharing of materials (i.e., advising handouts),
a regional newsletter, workshops, electronic mail, Internet, etc.;

4. Provide advice to advising centers on how to conduct regional and in-country workshops, pre-admission and pre-departure
orientation sessions, outreach activities, etc.

5. Provide needs assessments, training, and professional development for the educational advisers in the region
as necessary.

Please note that travel within the region for needs assessments and consultations, must be arranged by means of an
annual request (via cable) to the educational advising centers via the USIS office in each country.



Proposed Budget



Applicants must submit a comprehensive line-item budget for which specific details are available in the application
packet. The budget should not exceed $130,000, including the REAC. The applicant should submit separate line-item
budgets for the Educational Advising Center in Mexico City and for the REAC.

Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as cost to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E. Cost sharing and
matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does to provide the minimum amount of cost-sharing
as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's
contribution.

The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.

Department of Education





Direct Grant Programs and Fellowship Programs; Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year 1994














Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 111  Friday, June 10, 1994  Notices






<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION </USDEPT>




Direct Grant Programs and Fellowship Programs 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice inviting applications for new awards for fiscal year 1995. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary invites applications for new awards for fiscal year (FY) 1995 under some of the Department's direct
grant and fellowship programs and announces deadline dates for the transmittal of applications under these programs.
This combined application notice contains fiscal and programmatic information for potential applicants under
the Department's programs announced in this issue of the 

Federal Register

. This notice also lists FY 1995 programs previously announced in the 

Federal Register

.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department's first combined application notice was published in September 1989. It was based on the idea_subsequently
affirmed by numerous parties in the educational community_that placing as many application notices as possible
in a single notice would assist potential applicants in planning projects and activities. In the intervening years,
other issues affecting the application and grant award processes were identified, including the view of a number
of potential applicants that the Department's schedule for grant awards did not allow grantees sufficient time to
implement departmentally assisted projects before the start of the academic year. 



As part of the Administration's goal to ``reinvent'' the Federal Government, a departmentwide Quality Improvement
Team examined the Department's grant procedures and how these procedures affect the timely award of grants. The team's
recommendations, which have been adopted by the Secretary, will result in a number of changes in the way the Department
announces and awards grants under the Department's programs. 

In order to announce and award grants to accommodate the academic year, the Secretary determined that grants should
be awarded during the preceding spring, to the maximum extent possible. To allow applicants more time to prepare applications
and the Department the necessary time to process those applications, the Secretary further determined that application
announcements should be published in the spring preceding the year in which the grants will be awarded. 

Thus, it is the Secretary's intent to publish the Department's annual combined application notice in the spring rather
than in September, as has been the case until now. This policy will take full effect with the announcement of grants
for FY 1996. For this transition year the combined notice for FY 1995 is being published in two sections_one now, announcing
as many programs and competitions as possible at this time, and the other in September, announcing the remainder of
the Department's programs and competitions. 

Thus, this notice contains those application announcements that the Department is able to publish at this time, and
references application notices for FY 1995 that were published before this combined notice. Readers should note
that, unlike previous combined notices, this notice does not list_or give estimated dates for_programs and competitions
for which application notices are to be published at a later date. Those programs and competitions will be listed in
the September combined notice. 

Among the programs and competitions omitted from this notice are those governed by statutes that are undergoing congressional
reauthorization. These include programs administered by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages
Affairs and the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, and some programs of the Office of Educational Research
and Improvement. 

Also omitted from this notice are programs and competitions to be governed by new regulations or funding priorities
that have not yet been issued in final form. In addition, this notice does not contain programs and competitions that
will use application forms not yet approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980.

<TEXT>
 

The Secretary anticipates that most of the Department's remaining application notices for new awards for FY 1995
will be included in the second section of the combined notice, to be issued in September 1994, or published as separate
application notices before then. The September document will reference all programs and competitions announced
in this notice, as well as any for which application notices will have been published in the interim. 

Within the next month the Secretary intends to publish in the 

Federal Register

 amendments to the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) that will change how the Department
makes non-competing continuation discretionary grant awards for multi-year projects. The amendments will eliminate
the requirement that a recipient submit an application for a continuation award. Instead, the due dates for performance
reports will be adjusted so that they can be used to determine whether the recipient has met the criteria for receiving
the continuation award. This action is being taken to improve the effectiveness, integrity, and quality of the grant
award process and the projects that the Department funds. 

The amendments will affect the information that an applicant must submit to the Department when it applies for a new
grant for a multi-year project. Specifically, the applicant would submit a detailed budget for the entire project
period, rather than for only the first budget period of the project. This combined application notice announces the
amount the Secretary intends to award for only the first budget period of a multi-year project. In the application
package for an individual program or competition, applicants will receive information about the amount the Secretary
intends to make available for each year of a multi-year project. That will enable an applicant to provide a detailed
budget for each year of the grant, as will be required by the amended regulations. 



Organization of Notice 



Each principal program office is assigned a separate chart as follows: 

Chart 1_Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Languages Affairs. 

Chart 2_Office of Educational Research and Improvement. 

Chart 3_Office of Elementary and Secondary Education. 

Chart 4_Office of Postsecondary Education. 

Chart 5_Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative 
Services. 

Chart 6_Office of Vocational and Adult Education. 

Each of the charts that lists individual programs or competitions contains the following information: 

 The CFDA number and the name of each affected program. 

 The date of availability of applications. 

 The deadline date for transmitting applications. 

 For any program subject to the requirements of EO 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79, the deadline date
for transmitting comments under intergovernmental review. 

 The estimated range of awards. 

 The estimated average size of awards. 

 The estimated number of awards. 

For programs or competitions that have already published 
in the 

Federal Register

 application notices for FY 1995 grants, the chart references the date and page number of the notice. 

Following the chart for each principal program office are additional details for each affected program with an application
notice in this combined notice, including_

 A brief statement of the purpose of the program; 

 A list of eligible applicants; 

 A list of regulations applicable to the program; 

 Information regarding priorities, if any; 

 Supplemental information, if necessary, regarding selection criteria, any fiscal matters peculiar to the
program or competition, or other matters; 

 The project period in months; 

 The name, address, and telephone number of the person or office at the Department to contact for applications
or information; and 

 A citation of the statutory or other legal authority for the program. 

In addition, some programs have listed an estimated award date. 



Available Funds 



The Congress has not yet enacted a fiscal year 1995 appropriation for the Department of Education. However, the Department
is publishing this notice in order to give potential applicants adequate time to prepare applications. Estimates
of the amount of funds available for these programs are based in part on the President's 1995 budget request and in part
on the level of funding available for fiscal year 1994. The Department of Education is not Bound by any of the Estimates
in this Notice. 



National Education Goals 



On March 31, 1994, the President signed into law the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (Pub. L. 103-227). The Act
enunciates eight National Education Goals for the year 2000: 

 All children in America will start school ready to learn. 

 The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent. 

 All students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency in challenging subject matter,
including English, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, arts, history,
and geography; and every school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be
prepared for responsible 
citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our Nation's modern economy. 

 United States students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement.

 Every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global
economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 

 Every school in the United States will be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms
and alcohol and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. 

 The Nation's teaching force will have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional
skills and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to instruct and prepare all American students
for the next century. 

 Every school will promote partnerships that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting
the social, emotional, and academic growth of children. 

In developing this combined application notice the Department has sought to ensure that programs awarding grants
during FY 1995 will further achievement of the National Education Goals. The Secretary encourages applicants under
these programs to consider the National Education Goals in developing their applications. 



Applicability of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 



Some programs included in this combined application notice may provide that a grant, fellowship, traineeship, or
other monetary benefit may be awarded to an individual. This award may be made to the individual either directly by
the Department or by a grantee that receives Federal funds for the purpose of providing, for example, fellowships,
traineeships, or other awards to individuals. 

Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690; redesignated as section 421 of the Controlled
Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. 862) provides that a sentencing court may deny eligibility for certain Federal benefits
to an individual convicted of drug trafficking or possession. Thus, an individual who applies for a grant, fellowship,
or other monetary benefit under a program covered by this notice should understand that, if convicted of drug trafficking
or possession, he or she is subject to denial of eligibility for that benefit if the sentencing court imposes such a
sanction. 

This denial applies whether the Federal benefit is provided to the individual directly by the Department or is provided

through a grant, fellowship, traineeship, or other award made available with Federal funds by a grantee. 

Any persons determined to be ineligible for Federal benefits under the provisions of section 5301 are listed in the
General Services Administration's ``Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs.''




Applicability of the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 



The programs announced in this notice make discretionary awards subject to the eligibility requirements of the Federal
Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-647; 28 U.S.C. 3201). The Act provides that if there is a judgment
lien against a debtor's property for a debt to the United States, the debtor is not eligible to receive a Federal grant
or loan, except direct payments to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary, until the judgment is paid in full or
otherwise satisfied. 



Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs 



Certain programs in this notice are subject to the requirements of EO 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. These
programs are identified in Charts 1 through 6 with a date in the column headed ``Deadline for intergovernmental review.''
For further information, an applicant under a program subject to the Executive order and other parties interested
in that program_are directed to the appendix to this notice.

Administrative Exception to Worker Protection Standard Early Entry Prohibition for Harvesting Cut Roses 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Administrative Exception decision.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is granting an administrative exception to the general prohibition on early entry into pesticide treated areas
for hand labor contained in the Worker Protection Standard issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The exception allows, for a 2-year period, under specified conditions, early entry
to harvest greenhouse-grown cut roses. This exception will provide the cut rose industry additional time to develop
and implement safe alternatives to early entry. EPA is denying an exception for other cut flower and cut fern industries
at this time. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Background 



EPA issued on August 21, 1992, (57 FR 38102) a final rule establishing Worker Protection Standards (WPS) for agricultural
pesticides (40 CFR part 170). The WPS includes a prohibition against routine early entry to pesticide treated areas
to perform hand labor tasks during restricted-entry intervals (referred to as ``early entry''). Section 170.112(e)
of the WPS provides a process for considering exceptions to this prohibition against early entry. In the same August
21, 1992 

Federal Register

, EPA proposed to grant an exception to the early-entry prohibition for the cut flower and cut fern industries. Information
received from the industry during the comment period for the proposed WPS persuaded EPA that there could be substantial
economic repercussions if routine hand labor tasks were prohibited during the restricted-entry interval (57 FR
38175). EPA solicited comments on the proposed exception for the cut flower and cut fern industries and received a
wide range of comments both supporting and opposing the proposed exception. 




II. EPA's Exception Decision



EPA has reviewed the information received and has decided to grant a modified exception to the early-entry prohibition
for harvesting greenhouse-grown cut roses only. The information submitted by the rose industry combined with EPA's
knowledge of rose production convinced EPA that rose growers could suffer a substantial economic impact if compliance
with the WPS early-entry restrictions were required. EPA is granting a 2-year exception to provide rose growers
time to adjust pesticide spray schedules, find early-entry alternatives, and develop technology. The exception
is subject to conditions designed to mitigate risk to early-entry workers. EPA believes that early entry under the
terms of the exception for the period of 2 years will not pose unreasonable adverse effects to rose harvesters.

EPA believes the economic benefits of a 2-year exception for rose growers may be high and that the conditions
of this exception will mitigate workers' risks. EPA does not, however, have sufficient information about the risks
and benefits of the exception to grant a broader or longer term exception. If the rose industry determines that it needs
an exception beyond 2 years, the industry will need to provide additional information on the economic benefits of
an exception, as well as the risks, in a new exception request under 170.112(e)(1). This information should include
worker exposure data, poisoning incident data, personal protective equipment feasibility information, and data
on the economics of rose production and how WPS early
-entry restrictions affect revenues.

EPA has not received sufficient information to warrant an exception to the early-entry prohibition for other cut
flower and cut fern producers at this time. Information submitted in some comments suggests that alternatives to
early entry exist for these other crops and that such an early entry prohibition would not cause economic repercussions
great enough to outweigh the risk to workers. Growers of other cut flowers and cut ferns who would still like EPA to consider
an exception for these crops should submit an exception request which supplies the information outlined in 170.112(e)(1).
This includes information on crop production and pesticide use practices, alternative practices, economic data,
safety practices, and the costs and feasibility of implementing the conditions under which an exception would be
granted. 



III. Comments, Summary of Major Issues Raised in the Comments
 and EPA's Findings



In the WPS, EPA prohibited early entry for hand labor such as harvesting because EPA concluded that entry during a restricted-entry
interval (REI) to perform routine hand labor tasks is rarely necessary, that personal protective equipment (PPE)
for field workers is impractical because workers may remove it or use it incorrectly, and that PPE may be risk inducing
because of heat stress concerns. Here, the rose industry has made a case, at least for the interim, that routine entry
during an REI to harvest roses is necessary and that prohibiting such entry could have a substantial economic impact
on rose growers.

Therefore, EPA is granting a limited exception to allow workers to harvest greenhouse-grown cut roses to avoid excessive
economic burden to rose growers. Under conditions described below, workers may enter treated areas under an REI to
harvest roses. EPA believes that in rose greenhouses, the use of PPE, a limitation on worker-exposure time, accessible
decontamination facilities, provision of label-specific information to workers, basic pesticide safety training,
and shade and mechanical cooling devices will mitigate risks for rose harvesters. The following additional factors
contributed to EPA's decision: (1) PPE would be worn for only limited periods of time; (2) greenhouses usually encompass
a much smaller area than field crops so that employers should more easily be able to ensure that workers wear the PPE;
(3) harvesting could be accomplished in a reasonably efficient manner while wearing the required PPE, including
coveralls, chemical-resistant gloves (possibly as liners underneath leather gloves), chemical-resistant footwear
and headgear (if the potential for head exposure exists), and protective eyewear; (4) the accessibility, usual in
rose greenhouses, of running water and in many cases showers for decontamination and heat-stress alleviation; and
(5) the availability, also usual in rose greenhouses, of shade, fans, or other mechanical ventilation to provide
some cooling. EPA therefore believes that early entry with PPE would be feasible and provide adequate reduction of
risks to rose harvesters. Under the conditions of this exception there will be less pesticide exposure to rose harvesters
than in the past.

However, because of continuing uncertainty about the potential risks to early-entry rose harvesters and about the
extent of the economic impact of WPS entry restrictions, and because EPA believes that certain alternative practices
will eventually reduce or eliminate the need for early entry for rose harvesting, EPA is limiting the exception to
2 years. Should industry determine it needs an exception beyond 2 years, the industry will need to provide EPA with
additional information on risks and benefits to support such an exception request. 




A. Economic Need



Comments received from rose growers estimated annual revenue losses from $22,000 to more than $50,000 per acre as
a result of restricted-entry intervals imposed by the WPS, should no exception be granted. Roses, Incorporated,
a national association representing rose growers, estimated an average annual loss of $35,000 per acre for rose growers
nationally. This is based on an estimated loss of the equivalent of 1 day's harvest per week due to the WPS. These figures
appear to be based on the frequency at which pesticides are normally applied in rose production, the toxicity categories
of the pesticides most commonly used on roses, and the need to harvest roses 2 times per day to ensure the harvested crop
will yield a premium price. One comment stated that a rose crop can lose 80 percent of its value in 5 hours if not harvested
promptly. Several rose growers commented that, given the practices currently employed on their operations, they
would lose from 10 percent to 28 percent of their crop as a result of the WPS prohibition against reentry for harvesting
during restricted-entry intervals, which range from 12 to 48 hours. These comments cite an average loss of 1 to 2-days'
harvest each week depending on the pesticides applied.

Many growers also cited foreign competition in the rose industry as posing a serious economic threat. According to
information submitted, imported roses, which represented less than 10 percent of the domestic market in 1980, now
account for approximately 50 percent of the U.S. rose supply. Several comments noted that roses can be produced outside
the U.S. with far lower labor costs and fewer government restrictions on chemicals used and on workplace safety. A
few comments stated that domestic rose producers have managed to retain an economic edge over their foreign competitors
by producing higher quality roses. These comments also noted, however, that quality rose production is dependent
on intensive pesticide use to ensure an enhanced cosmetic standard.

Comments opposing the exception noted that the industry's estimates are based on current practices which rely on
entry as soon as sprays have dried and dusts have settled. These comments suggested that alternative cultivation
practices, such as improved scheduling of pesticide applications around essential work activities and use of nonchemical
or less-toxic chemical pesticides, would either greatly reduce or eliminate the need for early entry.

One rose grower also noted that improved worker safety, while important in itself, has economic benefits which would
offset some of the costs to employers brought on by the conditions of the exception proposed by EPA.

EPA currently has insufficient information to project quantitatively the economic impacts of not granting an exception
to rose growers at this time. Given current practices, it is clear that without an exception to early-entry prohibitions,
rose growers would be forced to change their practices. EPA expects that such changes in pesticide-use patterns,
harvesting, post-harvest handling, scheduling of activities, or other cultural practices will either decrease
growers' revenues, increase costs, or both, thereby decreasing growers' income at least in the short run. Given EPA's
knowledge of rose culture, including the high per acre value of rose production, and information presented in comments
submitted by rose growers, EPA believes that the impacts of denying the exception at this time could be substantial.

EPA also believes that the entry requirements set out in the terms of the exception will encourage the rose industry
to adopt alternative production practices which ultimately will reduce the need for early entry, the toxicity of
pesticide used, the frequency of pesticide use, and, eventually, the potential economic losses resulting from WPS
entry restrictions.



B. Risk to Workers



Most comments opposing the proposed exception identified risk to workers as a primary concern. These comments observed
that the frequency and volume of pesticide use in flower production which is necessary to maintain a high cosmetic
standard contributes to worker exposure risk.

Several comments included specific information about injuries and poisonings relating to benomyl use. (EPA notes
that in 1992 all ornamental uses of benomyl, including use on roses, were voluntarily cancelled. Therefore benomyl
should pose no added risk to workers harvesting roses under this exception.)

A number of comments also noted injuries to workers in cut-fern operations and included testimonials from fern workers
who suffered pesticide-related illnesses or injuries. Some comments included reference to a study (Brouwer et.
al. 1991) which suggested that workers in cut flower cultivation may experience higher exposure than workers who
apply the pesticides.

Most comments from growers, on the other hand, noted safety records reflecting few, if any, lost work days as a result
of worker exposure to pesticides. Roses, Inc., surveyed its members in 1988 about pesticide safety records and suggested
that the survey results supported these comments. However, due to the limited scope of the survey and because the survey
to some extent relied on growers' memories for data collection, it is difficult to draw conclusions from the results.

Many growers' comments noted that a factor contributing to rose workplace safety is the relative stability of the
work force. Since roses are cultivated year round there is less worker turnover than in other, seasonal crops. Some
growers cited an average employment period of 5 years or more per worker, and others added that rose workers are frequently
paid by the hour rather than at a piece rate, which may encourage safer work practices. Rose growers also commented
that productive workers must be trained and gain experience in cultivation and harvesting techniques. This employer
investment also contributes to work force stability and safety.

1981 to 1990, indicate that workers in horticultural specialty crops, which include roses, had a slightly higher
rate of pesticide poisoning (0.53 poisonings per 1,000 workers per year) than that for agricultural workers in general
(0.46 poisonings per 1,000 workers per year). This data, as well as information gathered by Agency experts about intensive
pesticide use in rose production, has led EPA to determine that, without PPE and the other protective conditions of
this exception, risk is as high or higher for rose harvesters as for workers harvesting outdoor agricultural crops
such as strawberries, cotton, leaf crops, etc. EPA believes worker exposure risk is a serious concern in greenhouse
rose production. Certain workplace conditions discussed below, however, increase the likelihood that the conditions
of this exception will effectively mitigate worker exposure risk.

The Brouwer study measured pesticide residues collected on hand and arm coverings worn by workers during flower-cultivation
activities without any protective clothing or gloves being placed between treated foliage and the residue collectors.
Workers in the Brouwer study were not provided with or required to use protective gear and their time in treated areas
was not limited. EPA believes the conditions of this exception, which also include training about pesticide hazards
and personal safety, and employer-provided PPE and decontamination facilities, will reduce worker exposure during
harvesting activities permitted by this exception. Because the rose workforce is comparatively small and stable,
EPA believes the conditions placed on this exception will be easier to implement and monitor than for many other agricultural
crops.

EPA remains concerned about worker risk in rose cultivation. EPA is gathering the data necessary to establish chemical-specific
REIs to ensure workers are adequately protected from risks associated with reentry. As a result of this process, some
product-specific REIs appearing on pesticide labels include special restrictions. The exception described in
this Notice may be used unless early entry is expressly prohibited in product labeling. 



C. Conditions of the Exception



In 1992, EPA proposed to grant this exception subject to the following conditions: (1) The PPE specified on the product
labeling for early entry is provided, cleaned, and maintained for the worker by the employer, and measures to prevent
heat-related illness are implemented, when appropriate; (2) no entry takes place for the first 4 hours after the application
and, thereafter, until any exposure level listed in the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria established
by the WPS or in the labeling have been met; (3) the time in treated areas for each worker may not exceed 3 hours in any 24-hour
period; (4) the required decontamination and change areas are provided; and (5) the required basic training and label-specific
information have been furnished. Public comments on these conditions, which are designed to mitigate risk to early-entry
workers, are discussed below.

At the time the exception was proposed, EPA expected that the basic provisions of the WPS for all workers would be provided
for early-entry workers under this exception. However, since recent legislation has delayed the compliance date
of certain WPS provisions, some of those basic protections have been incorporated into the conditions of this exception.


1.

 Personal protective equipment (PPE).

 Several comments opposing the exception stated that PPE use is not practical or feasible for harvesters. The Farmworker
Justice Fund and others noted that often workers are not provided with PPE because it is expensive. Farmworker advocates
also commented that PPE is not practical for harvesting cut flowers because it is awkward to use and uncomfortable.
This, they argued, is a disincentive for some workers_those paid a piece rate_to use PPE since it could slow their work
and thus reduce their pay.

Some comments from rose growers echoed these concerns and recommended EPA permit early entry with normal work attire
(long sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes and socks) and leather gloves, expressing fear that a crop could be damaged
by PPE-encumbered harvesters. Other rose growers noted that, relative to the value of lost crop without an exception,
the cost of PPE is low. Therefore, employers would assume the cost of providing PPE to their workers if it were a condition
of the exception. Some growers also commented that rose workers are frequently paid by the hour rather than a piece
rate. In such cases, there would be no economic reason for workers to avoid use of PPE.

EPA notes that in most situations_even for toxicity category I pesticides_the most PPE that would be required for
early-entry workers will be coveralls over long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, socks, chemical-resistant footwear,
and chemical-resistant gloves. If the pesticide is an eye irritant, eye protection also will be required. EPA believes
that this level of PPE is not likely to affect workers' mobility or dexterity to the extent that it could lead to a damaged
crop or discourage workers from using the required PPE.

The Farmworker Justice Fund and other commenters who opposed the exception questioned the feasibility of PPE for
protecting workers. Some comments cited a study evaluating PPE during chemical applications (Fenske, R.A., 1988)
which demonstrated certain deficiencies in PPE's protective qualities. These deficiencies included pesticide
exposure through seams and openings in protective garments. The study also showed exposure as a result of workers
removing gloves because of discomfort.

EPA notes that, while some problems identified in the Fenske study which involved pesticide applicators may also
apply to early-entry workers, the potential circumstances of exposure differ. Under this exception, early-entry
workers would enter to work in a treated area under an REI only after a minimum of 4 hours have elapsed since the end of
an application, while applicators involved in treating the area would have potential for direct exposure to pesticide
formulations as they are applied. Additionally, the time in treated areas under this exception would be limited to
3 hours per worker per day. Also, since the Fenske study, several PPE manufacturers have made improvements in their
products including better engineered seam closures, lighter-weight materials, and enhanced comfort for workers.




Chemical-resistant gloves and glove liners.

 If the product label requires chemical-resistant gloves, the WPS allows rose harvesters to use chemical-resistant
glove liners under leather gloves in lieu of chemical-resistant gloves because of concern over sharp thorns. (Once
leather gloves have been worn for this use, thereafter they may only be worn with chemical-resistant glove liners
and for no other use.) Roses, Inc., and other commenters in favor of the exception requested that EPA allow rose harvesters
to use leather gloves only in lieu of either chemical-resistant gloves or leather gloves with chemical-resistant
glove liners. These comments stated that chemical-resistant gloves that are sufficiently supple and durable for
rose harvesting are not yet available. Roses, Inc., after testing some glove options with member growers, added that
chemical-resistant glove liners tend to be uncomfortable to wear and cause hands to sweat excessively which may encourage
skin and fingernail diseases. One comment suggested permitting the use of cotton glove liners in lieu of chemical-resistant
liners.

EPA remains convinced that leather gloves do not sufficiently prevent pesticide exposure, and in many cases may pose
a greater hazard than if no gloves at all are worn. Since leather is virtually impossible to decontaminate once impregnated
with pesticide residues, workers who wear such gloves are subjecting their hands to uninterrupted contact with residues
and are thus at increased risk of pesticide-related problems. Agency experts also doubt the ability of cotton liners
to be an effective barrier to residues given the duration and conditions under which the gloves would likely be worn.
EPA notes that obtaining chemical-resistant gloves of a quality and durability appropriate for harvesting thorn-type
roses is difficult at present. However, several varieties of lightweight and disposable chemical-resistant gloves
and glove liners are currently available which EPA believes, when worn under leather gloves, would not significantly
affect a worker's dexterity. EPA therefore continues to require the use of either chemical-resistant gloves or leather
gloves over chemical-resistant glove liners under this exception. 



Heat stress.

 Another concern expressed in the comments was that PPE may increase workers' risk of heat stress. Information was
presented that suggested heat is a serious health threat to workers, particularly those in fern operations.

Several growers commented that PPE would not pose a significant heat problem for rose workers because of several mitigating
factors. These comments noted that temperature must be carefully regulated for successful rose cultivation through
use of fans and venting during hot weather. One comment added that it is rare for temperatures in a rose greenhouse to
exceed 90 degrees. Comments also added that water for drinking and decontamination is immediately available in virtually
all rose greenhouses. EPA believes that such conditions make it likely that PPE will not pose the risk of heat-related
illness to be expected for workers in other crops. 



Conclusions

. EPA recognizes the potential risks of worker exposure and heat stress during early-entry work; however, EPA believes
that the PPE required under the exception is feasible and likely to provide adequate reduction of risks to workers
in the rose industry. This is based on several factors: PPE would be worn for only limited periods of time; harvesters
could work relatively efficiently while wearing the required PPE; water for drinking and decontamination is immediately
available in most rose greenhouses; and the usual presence in rose greenhouses of fans or other mechanical ventilation
to provide some cooling. Also, that the rose workforce is relatively stable and frequently paid an hourly wage rather
than a piece rate, contributes to this determination.

Under this exception, EPA is requiring that early-entry workers wear PPE listed on the pesticide product label for
early-entry workers. Early-entry PPE is generally equal to that which would be worn by applicators of the chemical
in question (minus respirators, since entry is prohibited until the exposure level listed on the labeling has been
reached or any ventilation criteria established by the WPS or in the labeling have been met). Additionally, under
the conditions of this exception, early-entry workers would be instructed how to put on, use, and take off early-entry
PPE, the importance of washing thoroughly after removing PPE, and how to prevent, recognize, and give first aid for
heat-related illness. 

2. 

4-hour prohibition versus ``sprays dried and dusts settled

.'' Several growers commented that the performance standard of ``sprays have dried and dusts have settled'' is preferable
to EPA's generic entry prohibition of 4 hours after an application. Comments noted that the ``sprays dried/dust settled''
standard is both more workable for their industry and more protective of workers: sprays usually dry in 2 - 3 hours,
but sometimes, in humid greenhouse conditions, may not be dry until after more than 4 hours have elapsed.

Comments, both favoring and opposing the exception, cited California regulations governing re-entry. The California
Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) also submitted comments. California's current regulations allow reentry
for hand labor activities when sprays have dried and dusts have settled for most toxicity category II and III pesticides,
and for six category I pesticides of importance to the greenhouse industry. (These six category I pesticides are skin
and eye irritants.) Otherwise, entry is restricted for 24 hours following application of a category I product. According
to CDPR, ``These reduced entry intervals are based on workers being protected by work clothes and gloves, and instructions
to shower at the end of the work period.''

EPA adopted the generic 4-hour period of no entry as a means of removing personal judgment from the entry equation.
Sprays dry at different rates in different parts of a treated area, depending on greenhouse conditions. Therefore,
it is a difficult and subjective decision as to when entry is permissible under a ``sprays dried'' standard. For this
reason, the ``sprays dried'' standard is also difficult to enforce. EPA continues to believe that there should be
no entry into freshly treated areas which would involve contact with treated surfaces until the dusts or sprays have
settled and some drying or volatilization of the formulation has taken place_4 hours. Thus, under this exception,
EPA prohibits entry to treated areas for the first 4 hours after an application. (Also, entry is not permitted until
any exposure level listed on the labeling has been reached or any ventilation criteria established by the WPS or in
the labeling have been met. In some cases this will exceed 4 hours.) EPA believes that the conditions of this exception
will protect workers from hazardous pesticide exposures regardless of a pesticide's toxicity category. 

3.

 3 hours per worker per 24 hours limit

. EPA proposed that each worker could not exceed 3 hours of early entry in any 24-hour period. The 3-hour
limit was based on comments from Roses, Inc., on the proposed WPS which stated that 3 hours per worker per 24 hours would
allow for most harvest needs and would limit worker exposure. Many comments from growers recommended extending the
amount of time a worker may spend in a restricted area beyond 3 hours in a 24-hour period.

Several comments from rose growers suggested that normally 3 hours per worker per 24-hour period would be sufficient
to carry out necessary harvesting during a restricted-entry interval. Most comments noted, however, that an early-entry
worker may need to harvest for more than 3 hours during holiday harvest times. One comment stated that up to 8 hours could
be needed. A few comments recommended a weekly standard rather than a 24-hour limit. Roses, Inc., also suggested
that, given the proposed PPE conditions, a time limit would not be necessary. Some grower comments, however, indicated
that the 3-hour limit would not pose significant problems and that pesticide applications could be scheduled
around holiday harvests.

Comments opposing the exception raised the concern of worker non-compliance: if harvesters are paid piece rate they
will have a strong economic incentive to exceed the 3-hour limit.

EPA is persuaded of the industry's economic need, given current production practices, to harvest roses during restricted-entry
intervals, and recognizes that the time required to harvest roses varies from greenhouse to greenhouse and depends
on holiday demand. Based on comments submitted by industry and knowledge of rose cultivation practices, EPA will
accept 3 hours to be the amount of time needed to meet most harvest needs.

EPA points out that the effectiveness of PPE, upon which workers will rely to prevent exposure, declines the longer
equipment is worn. Chemical resistance also decreases with time. Additionally, the longer a worker wears PPE the
more likely it becomes that the worker will remove pieces as the PPE grows less comfortable. EPA believes an individual
should not exceed 3 hours of early-entry rose harvesting in any 24-hour period. Therefore, the proposed 3-hour
limit remains a condition of the exception. Any employers allowing their workers to exceed the 3-hour limit
would be violating the WPS. 

4.

 Decontamination facilities

. Worker advocates commented that decontamination supplies will be too expensive for many employers to justify.

Growers have responded that, like PPE, decontamination supplies are cheap relative to the value of crop lost due to
entry restrictions. Employers would therefore assume the cost of decontamination supplies as a condition of the
exception. Rose growers also commented that water for drinking and decontamination are immediately available in
virtually all rose greenhouses.

EPA has decided that the proposed exception requirements for decontamination should remain a condition of this exception.


5.

 Training and label information

. EPA proposed that early-entry workers be given the required basic safety training for workers and be provided with
label-specific information before any early-entry work which involved contact with treated surfaces. Some comments
submitted by growers stated that the training and communication requirements were extensive, and requested clarification.

 
EPA notes that the basic safety training for early-entry workers under this exception is identical to the basic safety
training for other workers covered by the WPS, but early-entry workers must be trained before the early-entry work.
EPA has prepared the basic materials and resources for worker training under the WPS and is currently distributing
these widely through the States, USDA Cooperative Extension Service, and other training networks. Additionally,
EPA will provide copies of such training resources directly to the rose industry to help facilitate training as required
under the exception. 
 
Regarding the provision of label-specific information, EPA believes that workers harvesting roses during an REI
should be informed about the hazards associated with the chemicals to which they could be exposed. Early-entry workers
may either read the product labeling or the employer may inform the worker of the appropriate labeling requirements.
EPA believes this will not be unreasonably burdensome given the potential value of the information to workers, and
has decided to maintain this as a condition of the exception. 
 
6.

 Time limitation and alternative practices

. Several comments recommended a strict time limit, should an exception be granted, to provide an incentive for developing
and implementing alternative practices. 
 
The National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides (NCAMP) stated in their comments that a time limit for an exception
``is an appropriate tool to encourage the development and implementation of alternative pest control methods which
will result in greater worker safety.'' 
 
In the preamble to the WPS, EPA stated that the elimination of routine early entry for hand labor activities may ``force''
the development of technology such as engineering controls, mechanical harvesters, weeders, and pruners in crops
where the timing of such tasks is critical (57 FR 38116-38117, August 21, 1992). This exception is intended as
an interim measure which will allow growers time to explore and implement early-entry alternatives which are appropriate
for cut rose production. 
 
Several comments from both growers and worker advocates cited the existence of alternatives which should reduce
the need for early entry within a few years. Examples of alternatives named in the comments included lower toxicity
chemicals with shorter REIs, biological controls, engineering and technological advancements, genetic engineering
of resistant rose varieties, and cultural practices (such as scheduling pesticide applications and work activities
to avoid conflicts). The key difference between the growers' and the worker advocates' positions on alternatives
was the extent to which they believe such alternatives can be quickly and cost-effectively adopted by industry. 
 
The Farmworker Justice Fund presented information suggesting that several alternatives, including biological
controls and cultural practices, have been studied and found to be effective in controlling certain rose pests. 
 
In 1988 Roses, Inc., estimated a 5-year to 7-year time frame for the rose industry to develop alternatives
to toxicity category I and II pesticides. In 1992, Roses, Inc., commented that: 
 


While some progress had been made, a lack of research funds and pressures 
from subsidized and dumped low-cost rose imports have seriously reduced 
profitability, making research and capital investment funds extremely 
hard to obtain. Less toxic pesticides are being used. Introduction of new 
materials is helping.... But, they are still too few to answer our needs and 
let us rely only on Class III materials. 



 



New rose varieties being developed through genetic manipulation with disease and pest resistance are another possibility
cited by Roses, Inc. While progress has been made, here again Roses, Inc., states they are still years away from rose
plant introductions with significant engineered insect and disease resistance. 
 
Roses, Inc., noted that while certain biological controls are promising, they often require a grower to make a sizable
capital investment to implement. They conclude that these alternatives need more research, time, and money ``to
let the substitute practices mature as a real answer for our industry.'' 
 
The Society of American Florists suggested that EPA offer incentives to growers who use less toxic pesticides. The
Agency notes that, to a large extent, the provisions of the WPS are the incentive: growers who use primarily toxicity
category III and IV products may not need early entry and therefore would not have to provide PPE, etc., for their harvesters.

 
One grower commented, ``With some planning and shifting personnel we could keep early entry to a minimum.'' EPA lauds
this as an immediate, practical alternative. Information about rose cultivation gathered by Agency experts suggests
that in some cases roses can be cut early with minimal loss in crop value, if properly stored and handled. 
 
In general, for a complex and highly managed crop such as roses, EPA believes industry will attempt to make adjustments
in cultural practices and pesticide use patterns to minimize losses. 
 
A time limit will encourage development and implementation of safer methods of pest control. EPA believes that time
and research are needed to develop sustainable alternatives to early entry, but that the industry should aggressively
work toward implementation of alternatives that have been proven effective. EPA expects that much early entry can
be eliminated immediately through ``planning and shifting personnel'', and that in 2 years other alternatives to
toxicity category I and II pesticides can be implemented. 
 
Finally, while rose growers submitted sufficient information to convince EPA that an early-entry prohibition could
have a substantial economic impact, EPA believes that the benefits, based on the limited information presented,
only justify an interim period for the growers to adapt to the requirements of the WPS. Therefore, EPA has decided that
the exception for early entry for harvesting cut roses will expire 2 years from publication of this Notice. 
 
EPA continues to believe that in most cases the most reliable and effective means of risk reduction for harvesters
is to keep them out of treated areas until the expiration of the REI. However, because of the potentially considerable
economic benefits of an exception for the cut rose industry, EPA has decided to grant a temporary exception. Until
this exception expires, PPE, safety training and provision of label information, decontamination facilities,
and time-in-treated-area limits, etc., will be the primary means of mitigating early-entry workers' pesticide
exposure risk. 
 
EPA will consider another exception for roses if the industry submits a request supported by the full set of data required
under 170.112(e), including the feasibility of the conditions of this exception, and can clearly demonstrate that
an aggressive attempt to develop and implement alternative practices was made during the period of this exception.

 


D. Activities Not Included in the Exception 
 


Many comments from growers urged the Agency to include tasks such as watering, pruning, and disbudding in this exception,
and to clarify whether ``passing through'' a restricted area would be acceptable. 
 
Farmworker advocates' comments recognized that while industry comments had stated the need to harvest roses twice
daily, 365 days per year, insufficient evidence was provided to support early entry for activities other than harvesting.

 
Sufficient evidence has not been presented to show that pruning and disbudding could not be accomplished outside
of normal restricted-entry intervals. EPA believes these tasks can be accomplished without early entry through
coordinated planning and scheduling without undue economic hardship for the industry. 
 
In several rose greenhouses, automated or semi-automated irrigation is becoming the norm. In such operations, watering
may be accomplished either without entry into the greenhouse or without contact with treated surfaces in the greenhouse;
such entry may be permitted under 170.112(b). 
 
EPA expects that passing through a treated area would be permissible, in most cases, under 170.112(b), 

Exception for activities with no contact

, as long as the employer ensures the conditions of 170.112(b)(1) and (2) are met, that is, the worker will have no contact
with treated surfaces, and no entry is allowed until any inhalation exposure criteria or ventilation criteria have
been met. 
 


E. Worker Compliance 
 


As noted above, some comments raised concern over workers' possible failure to observe the requirements of this exception.
Comments from growers expressed concern that employers are at risk of enforcement action should their workers fail
to follow directions to use the required personal protective equipment or stay out of restricted areas. 
 
EPA notes that responsibility for compliance with the general requirements of the WPS as well as the conditions of
this exception rests with employers. While employers are prohibited from taking retaliatory action against employees
for attempting to comply with the requirements of the WPS or this exception, the WPS does not prevent an employer from
disciplining a worker who fails to observe the employer's instructions to use PPE, stay out of restricted areas, or
other directions relating to WPS requirements. Such action in no way alleviates the responsibility of the employer
to adhere to the requirements of the WPS. 
 


F. Other Issues 
 


Some comments requested exceptions from provisions which are outside the scope permitted by the exception process
in 170.112(e). Such requests included (1) a special exception from oral notification and posting provisions, (2)
use of barrier tape in lieu of posting with the WPS warning sign, (3) special minor use registration assistance, and
(4) use of the exception process to revise other provisions of the WPS. Since these requests are beyond the scope of
170.112(e), they are not addressed here. 
 


IV. Response to Other Cut Flower and Cut Fern Producers 
 


For other cut flowers and cut ferns, EPA received very limited or no information on (1) projected economic impacts
of WPS entry restrictions, (2) technical or financial viability of alternative practices, and (3) the safety and
feasibility of an exception. Evidence submitted in some of the comments suggested that alternatives to early entry
exist for these other crops, and that an early-entry prohibition would not cause economic repercussions great enough
to outweigh the risk to workers. Therefore, EPA has determined that an exception for other cut flower and cut fern producers
is not warranted at this time. 
 


V. Terms of the Exception 
 


This exception for harvesting cut roses is narrower than the exception which was proposed by EPA in the August 21, 1992,


Federal Register

 (57 FR 38175) in that this exception extends only to harvesting cut roses and expires after 2 years. 
 
In April 1994, Congress enacted legislation which delays the compliance date for some of the basic safety provisions
of the WPS until January 1, 1995. This legislation permits entry during an REI for tasks relating to the production
of agricultural plants, but explicitly excludes hand labor activities, such as harvesting, from the permitted tasks.
EPA is including in the terms of this exception for rose harvesting, some basic safety provisions which will be provided
to all workers covered by the WPS on January 1, 1995. These include provisions for basic safety training, display of
a safety poster, posting of application information, decontamination, and emergency assistance. Notwithstanding
the 1994 legislation, agricultural employers taking advantage of the exception announced in this Notice must comply
with the conditions of this exception. The 1994 legislation does not affect the terms of this exception. 
 
The terms of the exception are the same as those proposed in the August 21, 1992, 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 38175), with the exception that a requirement has been added that agricultural employers who make use of this
exception inform their early-entry workers about the exception, and that the exception is limited to 2 years. The
basic safety provisions described above also have been included. 

 EPA reserves the right to withdraw exceptions, including the exception for cut roses, in accordance with 170.112(e)(6),


Withdrawing an exception

, if the Agency receives information or any other data that indicate the health risks posed by the exception are unacceptable
or if the Agency receives information that indicates the exception is no longer necessary or prudent. 
 
The exception described in this Notice may be used unless early entry is expressly prohibited in product labeling.
For example, some labels prohibit entry_including entry that would otherwise be permitted under the WPS and this
exception_by any person other than trained and equipped handlers performing handling tasks for specified periods
after the application. In such cases, during that period, early entry to harvest roses is not permitted under this
exception. 



Exception for harvesting roses:



I.

 Conditions.

 Under this exception, a worker may enter a treated area during a restricted-entry interval to harvest roses if the
agricultural employer ensures that the following requirements are met: 
 
(a) No such entry is allowed for the first 4 hours following the end of the application, and no such entry is allowed thereafter
until any inhalation exposure level listed in the labeling has been reached, or any ventilation criteria on the labeling
or, after January 1, 1995, established by 40 CFR 170.110(c)(3), have been met. 
 
(b) The time in treated areas during a restricted-entry interval for any worker harvesting roses under this exception
does not exceed 3 hours in any 24-hour period. 
 
(c) The agricultural employer ensures that the worker, before entering the treated area, either has read the product
labeling or has been informed, in a manner that the worker can understand, of all labeling requirements related to
human hazards or precautions, first aid, symptoms of poisoning, personal protective equipment specified for early
entry, and any other labeling requirements related to safe use. 
 
(d) The personal protective equipment specified on the product labeling for early entry is provided to the worker.
Such personal protective equipment shall conform to the following standards: 
 
(1) Personal protective equipment (PPE) means devices and apparel that are worn to protect the body from contact with
pesticides or pesticide residues, including, but not limited to, coveralls, chemical-resistant suits, chemical-resistant
gloves, chemical-resistant footwear, respiratory protection devices, chemical-resistant aprons, chemical-resistant
headgear, and protective eyewear. 
 
(2) Long-sleeved shirts, short-sleeved shirts, long pants, short pants, shoes, socks, and other items of work clothing
are not considered personal protective equipment for the purposes of this exception and are not subject to the requirements
of this exception, although pesticide labeling may require that such work clothing be worn during some activities.

 
(3) When ``chemical-resistant'' personal protective equipment is specified by the product labeling, it shall be
made of material that allows no measurable movement of the pesticide being used through the material during use. 
 
(4) When ``waterproof'' personal protective equipment is specified by the product labeling, it shall be made of material
that allows no measurable movement of water or aqueous solutions through the material during use. 
 
(5) When a ``chemical-resistant suit'' is specified by the product labeling, it shall be a loose-fitting, one- or
two-piece, chemical-resistant garment that covers, at a minimum, the entire body except head, hands, and feet. 
 
(6) When ``coveralls'' are specified by the product labeling, they shall be a loose-fitting, one- or two-piece garment,
such as a cotton or cotton and polyester coverall, that covers, at a minimum, the entire body except head, hands, and
feet. The pesticide product labeling may specify that the coveralls be worn over a layer of clothing. If a chemical-resistant
suit is substituted for coveralls, it need not be worn over a layer of clothing. 
 
(7) Gloves shall be of the type specified by the product labeling. Gloves or glove linings made of leather, cotton,
or other absorbent materials must not be worn for early-entry activities unless these materials are listed on the
product labeling as acceptable for such use. If chemical-resistant gloves with sufficient durability and suppleness
are not obtainable for tasks with roses or other plants with sharp thorns, leather gloves may be worn over chemical-resistant
liners. However, once leather gloves have been worn for this use, thereafter they shall be worn only with chemical-resistant
liners and they shall not be worn for any other use. 
 
(8) When ``chemical-resistant footwear'' is specified by the product labeling, it shall be one of the following types
of footwear: chemical-resistant shoes, chemical-resistant boots, or chemical-resistant shoe coverings worn
over shoes or boots. If chemical-resistant footwear with sufficient durability and a tread appropriate for wear
in rough terrain is not obtainable for workers, then leather boots may be worn in such terrain. 
 
(9) When ``protective eyewear'' is specified by the product labeling, it shall be one of the following types of eyewear:
goggles; face shield; safety glasses with front, brow, and temple protection; or a full-face respirator. 
 
(10) When ``chemical-resistant headgear'' is specified by the product labeling, it shall be either a chemical-resistant
hood or a chemical-resistant hat with a wide brim. 
 
(e) The agricultural employer ensures that:

(1) Workers wear the personal protective equipment correctly for its intended purpose and use personal protective
equipment according to manufacturer's instructions. 
 
(2) Before each day of use, all personal protective equipment is inspected for leaks, holes, tears, or worn places,
and any damaged equipment is repaired or discarded. 
 
(3) Personal protective equipment that cannot be cleaned properly is disposed of in accordance with any applicable
Federal, State, and local regulations. 
 
(4) All personal protective equipment is cleaned according to manufacturer's instructions or pesticide product
labeling instructions before each day of reuse. In the absence of any such instructions, it shall be washed thoroughly
in detergent and hot water. 
 
(5) Before being stored, all clean personal protective equipment is dried thoroughly or is put in a well-ventilated
place to dry. 
 
(6) Personal protective equipment contaminated with pesticides is kept separately and washed separately from any
other clothing or laundry. 
 
(7) Any person who cleans or launders personal protective equipment is informed that such equipment may be contaminated
with pesticides, of the potentially harmful effects of exposure to pesticides, and of the correct ways to handle and
clean personal protective equipment and to protect themselves when handling equipment contaminated with pesticides.

 
(8) All clean personal protective equipment is stored separately from personal clothing and apart from pesticide-contaminated
areas. 
 
(9) Each worker is instructed how to put on, use,
