<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Administrative Office of the United States Courts will conduct the written portion of the examination for individuals
who desire to be certified (in Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean) or ``otherwise qualified'' (in Arabic,
Hebrew, Italian, Mien, Polish, and Russian) to serve as interpreters in courts of the United States. This is in accordance
with the Court Interpreter Amendments Act of 1988, Title VII of Pub. L. 100-702, (28 U.S.C. 1827). To take the
examination, an individual must file a written application, or apply by telephone.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background



The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC) is responsible for the establishment
of a program to facilitate the use of certified and otherwise qualified interpreters in courts of the United States.
He must prescribe, determine, and certify the qualifications of person who may serve as certified interpreters in
bilingual proceedings and proceedings involving the hearing impaired (28 U.S.C. 1827(b)). Whenever an interpreter
is required for a person in any criminal or civil action initiated by the United States, the presiding judicial officer
must utilize the services of the most available certified interpreter, unless no certified interpreter is reasonably
available, or the services of an otherwise qualified interpreter. 




The AOUSC will provide the courts with a roster of certified, professionally qualified, and language skilled court
interpreters selected on the basis of specific qualification criteria and/or the successful completion of written
ad oral examinations.







II. This Examination





For Spanish language interpreter candidates, a comprehensive written Spanish/English examination testing bilingual
proficiency in Spanish and English will be administered. For candidates in the Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean languages,
a written English examination testing proficiency in English will be administered. Successful candidates will
be invited to sit for the second part of the certification examinations, an oral examination. The oral examination
will test, in simulated settings, the applicant's ability to: (1) interpret precisely from source language to English,
in consecutive and simultaneous modes; (2) interpret from English to the target language in consecutive and simultaneous
modes; and (3) perform sight interpretations. The oral portion of the examination does not necessarily require previous
experience in court interpreting. Applicants who successfully complete the written examination will receive notice
of the time and place of the oral portion of the examination.




For Arabic, Hebrew, Italian, Mien, Polish, and Russian interpreter candidates, a written English examination testing
proficiency in English will be administered. The second part of the qualification process as a professional or language
skilled court interpreter will require the candidate to provide additional qualifications and credentials or perform
back translation exercises successfully.



All of the examinations are developed and administered under contract by the University of Arizona. The written portion
of the examination does not require a special knowledge of legal vocabulary.




Testing Sites






Applicants may schedule the written examination at any of the locations identified below. Applicants must identify
the testing location which they desire to use to use for taking the written examinations. The following are the cities
where the written test will be administered:






Alaska: Anchorage.

Arizona: Phoenix, Tucson.

California: Fresno, Los Angeles, Monterey, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco.

Colorado: Denver.

Connecticut: Hartford.


District of Columbia.


Florida: Miami, Orlando.


Georgia: Atlanta.


Hawaii: Honolulu.


Idaho: Boise.


Illinois: Chicago.


Iowa: Sioux City.


Louisiana: New Orleans.


Massachusetts: Boston.


Minnesota: Minneapolis.


Missouri: Kansas City.


Nevada: Las Vegas, Reno.


New Jersey: Newark, Trenton.


New Mexico: Albuquerque, Las Cruces.


New York: Brooklyn, Buffalo, Manhattan.


Ohio: Cincinnati and Cleveland.


Oregon: Portland.


Puerto Rico: San Juan.


Tennessee: Memphis.


Texas: Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Houston, Laredo, San Antonio.


Utah: Salt Lake City.


Washington: Seattle.








Oral testing sites will be announced when the examinations are scheduled.







Filing





Written applications are preferred, but phone applications will be accepted if the fee is received by July 15, 1994.
Applicants who do not have an application form should type or print the following information on an 81/2 x 11
paper:






1. Name.
2. Mailing address, including zip code.
3. Daytime telephone number.
4. Evening telephone number.
5. Testing location requested (City and State).
6. Date of birth.
7. Social Security Number.
8. Special arrangements necessary because of physical disability or keeping of the Sabbath.
9. I did/did not take the Spanish written and/or oral examination in 1993.
10. I.D. number of exam (if known).
11. Enclosed money order, cashiers check, or personal check payable to University of Arizona Federal Court Project.



Exam Procedures





Each applicant will receive an admission ticket to the exam shortly before the exam date. It will list the exact location
of the exam. Each applicant must present the admission ticket and a photo identification: driver's license, passport,
work/student identification, etc., to be admitted to the exam.




III. Qualifications






Sucessful completion of the written examination is the first step in the process of receiving certification or ``otherwise
qualified'' status. There is no formal educational requisite, either in languages or interpreting, for successfully
completing the written examinations. However, the difficulty of the written examinations are at the college degree
level of proficiency in both English and the target languages. Successful completion of the oral portion of the examination
normally would require prior training or professional experience in simultaneous and consecutive interpreting
and sight translation. Qualification as ``otherwise qualified'' will require additional credentials and experience
as an interpreter.







IV. Duties






Certification or ``otherwise qualified'' status will not necessarily lead to full-time employment as a staff or
contract interpreter. Most of the requirements for court interpretation services in the Federal courts are met by
independent interpreter contractors on an as-needed basis. However, where full-time interpreters are needed,
only certified interpreters are eligible for appointment.


As the federal courts require full-time salaried interpreters, these interpreters will be chosen from the eligibility
lists. The annual salary range is JSP-10 to JSP-14 ($31,898-$76,733) for full-time salaried interpreters.
For certified interpreters who provide services as independent contractors, the fee is $250 per day.





Court interpreters perform all or some of the following duties: (1) Interpret verbatim in simultaneous and consecutive
modes a foreign language into English, and vice versa, at arraignments, preliminary hearings, pretrial hearings,
trials, and other court proceedings; (2) transcribe and translate electronic sound recordings; and (3) sight translate
or translate in written form technical, medical, and legal documents and correspondence for introduction as evidence.

Animal Damage Management



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed policy; request for comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service gives notice of and requests comment on proposed revisions to its policy on animal damage management
to be published in the Forest Service Manual Chapter 2650. This direction would replace current agency procedures
for implementing the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit and the Forest Service. This proposed policy is intended to clarify the
role and responsibility of the Forest Service in coordinating with APHIS on animal damage management and in cooperating
with APHIS in discharging Federal obligations to manage wild vertebrates causing damage on National Forest System
lands under the Animal Damage Control Act of 1931.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Forest Service and APHIS cooperate in discharging Federal obligations under the Animal Damage Control Act of
1931 (7 U.S.C. 426-426b) which governs animal damage management activities on National Forest System lands.
These activities include actions to provide wildlife damage management through direct control, as well as technical
assistance to achieve desired management objectives. APHIS, in cooperation with the Forest Service and states,
carries out animal damage management activities on some National Forest System lands, mostly to minimize livestock
losses from predation by coyotes, black bears, and other predators. Under other authorities (e.g., Multiple-Use
Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 [16 U.S.C. 528(note), 528-531]), the Forest Service conducts activities to control
animal damage caused by small mammals and other animals to National Forest System resources, such as timber stands
and roads.



APHIS has responsibility for animal damage management activities, as designated by the Secretary of Agriculture
(7 CFR 2.51(41)). The principal change being proposed in existing Forest Service Manual policy (FSM 2650) is the designation
of APHIS as the lead agency for preparing environmental documentation on animal damage management activities initiated
by APHIS on National Forest System lands. The Forest Service will cooperate with APHIS and the states in environmental
analysis and documentation of actions proposed by APHIS that will occur on or affect National Forest System lands
and provide mitigation measures needed to ensure that animal damage management activities performed by APHIS are
compatible with direction provided in forest land and resource management plans.

The proposed policy would bring the Forest Service Manual provisions into conformance with current field-level
animal damage management practice. Current operational procedures for animal damage management activities are
outlined in an August 25, 1992 letter to Forest Service Regional Foresters from Deputy Chief James C. Overbay and the
subsequent Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between APHIS and the Forest Service, signed June 18, 1993. Notice
of availability of the MOU was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 13, 1993 (58 FR 37704).

The 1993 MOU clarifies the role of each Forest Supervisor in cooperating with APHIS and the states in documentation
of environmental actions proposed by APHIS, and in providing mitigation measures to ensure that animal damage management
activities performed by APHIS are compatible with direction provided in forest plans. The MOU also clarifies that
APHIS, in cooperation with the Forest Service, develops work plans for animal damage management activities on National
Forest System lands. These plans address control areas, specific control techniques, emergency control procedures,
timeframes, and other limitations and restrictions. The MOU recognizes APHIS work plans as the definitive plans
for predator control actions on National Forest System lands.

After discussion with the Council on Environmental Quality, the Forest Service has decided to publish this proposed
animal damage management policy in the 

Federal Register

, inviting public comment on the role and responsibility of the Forest Service in coordinating with APHIS on animal
damage management. In the interim, the Forest Service and APHIS will follow procedures outlined in the 1993 MOU for
which notice was published in the 

Federal Register

.



Environmental Impact



Section 31.1b(2) of Forest Service Handbook 1909.15 (57 FR 43180, Sept. 18, 1992) excludes from documentation in
an environmental assessment or impact statement ``rules, regulations, or policies to establish Servicewide administrative
procedures, program processes, or instructions.'' This proposed policy would provide administrative instructions
to Forest Service field offices on the procedures and processes to follow in the case of coordination with APHIS on
animal damage management activities. Accordingly, the agency's preliminary assessment is that this proposed policy
falls within this category of action and that no extraordinary circumstances exist which would require preparation
of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. A final determination will be made upon adoption
of the final policy.



Controlling Paperwork Burden on the Public



This policy will not result in additional paperwork. Therefore, the review provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507) and implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320 do not apply.

Proposed Manual Revision




Note:

 The Forest Service organizes its directive system by alpha-numeric codes and subject headings. Only those sections
of the Forest Service Manual that are the subject of this notice are set out here. The audience for this direction is
Forest Service employees charged with coordinating with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service_Animal
Damage Control Unit on animal damage management activities on National Forest System lands.


Forest Service Manual_Chapter 2650_Animal Damage Management


The Forest Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit, along with
the states, cooperate in discharging the Federal obligations under the Animal Damage Control Act of 1931 to manage
animal damage on National Forest System lands. These activities include actions to provide wildlife damage management
through direct control, as well as technical assistance to achieve desired management objectives. APHIS carries
out animal damage management activities on National Forest System lands, mostly to minimize livestock losses from
predation by coyotes, black bears, and other predators. The Forest Service conducts activities to control animal
damage caused by small mammals and other animals to National Forest System resources, such as timber stands and roads.


2650.1_Authority.

 In addition to the authorities listed in FSM 2601, the following authorities govern animal damage management activities
on National Forest System lands:
1. The Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931 (7 U.S.C. 426-426b) as amended by the Rural Development, Agriculture,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture
to provide animal damage management services, to maintain technical expertise for evaluating and recommending
animal damage management techniques, and to conduct forest and range animal damage research. The Secretary has delegated
this authority to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit.
2. Executive Order 12342, January 24, 1982, permits the use of chemical toxicants registered by the Environmental
Protection Agency for predator damage control on federal lands.
3. Department of Agriculture Regulation (DR) 9500-4 (FSM 2601.2) requires Department of Agriculture programs
to include measures to alleviate damage by plant and animal pests; develop new techniques and methodologies through
management and research programs to limit damage to agriculture or forestry production; and apply integrated pest
management practices, where feasible, in carrying out these responsibilities.
4. A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between APHIS and the Forest Service outlines the cooperative approach to
animal damage management on National Forest System lands. Both agencies have a joint responsibility for limiting
damage caused by wildlife. In this MOU, APHIS and state agencies are recognized as having the authority and expertise
to conduct predator control on National Forest System lands, to determine livestock losses, and to determine methodology
for animal damage management. See FSM  1543.14 for the full text of the MOU.


2650.2_Objective.

 The objective of animal damage management activities is to protect National Forest System resources, to protect
activities taking place on National Forest System lands, and to reduce threats to human health and safety.


2650.3_Policy.

 National Forest System resources must be adequately protected during animal damage management activities authorized
by the states and conducted by the states or Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control
unit. When the Forest Service conducts animal damage management activities, such as controlling small mammal populations
on plantations, the agency must comply fully with state and federal laws. In carrying out animal damage management
activities:
1. Rely upon APHIS or the state agencies to provide the expertise and conduct predator control on National Forest System
lands, to determine livestock losses, and to determine methodology for animal damage management.
2. Cooperate with APHIS, the lead agency, in preparing environmental documentation for predator control and other
animal damage management activities initiated by APHIS on National Forest System lands. The Forest Service shall
cooperate to ensure that the animal damage management plans developed by APHIS will provide for protection of National
Forest System resources.

3. Cooperate with APHIS in the development of work plans to ensure consistency with forest land and resource management
plans.

4. Conduct non-predator animal damage management, such as controlling small mammal populations on plantations,
and necessary environmental analysis and disclosure on National Forest System lands consistent with forest plans.

5. Recognize that taking of predators, including removal of depredating animals (for example, removal of a nuisance
bear in a high-use recreation area), may be carried out on National Forest System lands by an individual in accordance
with state and federal law.

6. Coordinate with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other federal and state agencies to improve effectiveness
of control program activities conducted on National Forest System and other public lands.

7. Use an integrated approach to the prevention of animal damage and management of animal damage control programs.
Consider a full range of methods, including physical barriers, repellents, habitat manipulation, biological controls,
silvicultural methods (for example, fertilizing to improve soil fertility), pesticides, and hunting and trapping.
Use licensed hunting, fishing, and trapping as a control technique where practicable.

8. Use only pesticides that are properly registered in accordance with federal and state requirements for animal
damage management and that conform to policies on pesticide-use management and coordination (FSM 2150). Follow
label directions.

9. Follow direction in FSM 2670. Threatened, Endangered, and Sensitive Plants and Animals, for federally proposed,
threatened, endangered, or sensitive species listed by the Forest Service to determine whether proposed control
measures conducted by the Forest Service are likely to have an effect on these species. The lead agency for completing
environmental documentation (40 CFR 1508.16) is responsible for completion of all Endangered Species Act-mandated
interagency consultations (16 U.S.C. 1536.7; FSM 2671.4).



2650.4_Responsibility.

2650.42_Deputy Chief for National Forest System. 

The Deputy Chief for the National Forest System is responsible for resolving any difficulties arising between Regions
and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit that cannot be resolved by Regional

2650.6_Cooperation in Animal Damage Management Activities. 

Both the Forest Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)_Animal Damage Control unit have a
responsibility for limiting damage caused by wildlife, consistent with other wildlife values and resource management
objectives. APHIS responsibilities are generally directed toward the management and control of animals causing
damage to livestock, agriculture, wildlife, human health and safety. Forest service responsibilities are related
to the management of National Forest System resources. See FSM  1543.14 for the text of the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Forest Service and APHIS for animal damage management activities.
The role of APHIS (7 CFR 2.51(41)) is as follows:
1. Evaluate animal damage management needs and conduct predator control in cooperation with the Forest Service,
state agencies, and permittees.
2. Serve as lead agency for preparing environmental documentation on animal damage management activities initiated
by APHIS on National Forest System lands.
3. Develop and update animal damage management work plans in cooperation with the Forest Service and appropriate
state and federal agencies, and interested publics to ensure compliance with forest plans.
4. Inform the Forest Service about animal damage management requests, management activities, and results on a timely
basis.
5. Provide the Forest Service with technical information on recommended animal damage management tools and techniques.
6. Conduct animal damage management training sessions for Forest Service personnel, when requested.


2651_Wildlife and Fish Damage Management
2651.1_Threatened and Endangered Species. 

Follow specific species control plans for federally listed species (for example, grizzly bear and wolf) cleared
through consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service.


2651.2_Game and Furbearers.

Control damage caused by nongame species on National Forest System lands in close cooperation with the state fish
and wildlife agencies, or other involved state or federal agencies.


2651.4_Birds. 

Where birds damage reforestation or other resources or where they create health hazards, nonlethal repellents,
frightening devices, pesticides, or physical barriers may be used to prevent or reduce resource damage or hazards.
Obtain permits from the Fish and Wildlife Service for any lethal control of species protected under the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act. Consult the Fish and Wildlife Service for permit requirements and procedures.


2651.5_Fish and Aquatic Animals. 

States or other responsible agencies have the authority to control undesirable fish and aquatic animals in National
Forest System waters. The Forest Service is responsible for coordinating with the responsible agencies to develop
a work plan to ensure control activities are consistent with direction provided in forest plans. Control activities
conducted by the Forest Service must meet appropriate environmental analysis requirements and be consistent with
forest plan direction.


2651.6_Wildlife and Fish Damage Management in Wilderness Areas. 

Follow direction in FSM 2151, FSM 2323, and FSM 4063 for management of wildlife or fish damage in wilderness and Research

Period of Investigation


The period of investigation is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994.


Such or Similar Comparisons


We have determined that the merchandise covered by this investigation constitutes a single category of ``such or
similar'' merchandise.


Best Information Available


Because Thy-Marcinelle failed to respond to our questionnaire, we based our determination on best information available
(BIA) pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act which provides that the Department shall use BIA when a party refuses to
provide requested information.
In determining what rate to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperated in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who did not cooperate in an investigation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology
outlined in the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium, 

58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required, or otherwise
significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to that company
the higher of (1) The highest margin alleged in the petition, or (2) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in
the investigation. (See 

Allied Signal Aerospace Co. 

v. 

United States, 

996 F. 2d 1185, 1191-92 (Fed. Cir. 1993).) Because there were no cooperative respondents in this investigation,
we are assigning to all exporters, as BIA, a margin of 52.34 percent, the highest margin calculated in the petition
(adjusted for methodological errors as explained in the initiation notice).


Suspension of Liquidation


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of steel wire rod from Belgium that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the
date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.






ITC Notification


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination or 45 days after
our final determination.


Public Comment


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than 
June 28, 1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than July 1, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public
hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal
briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held on July 7, 1994, at 10 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3708,
14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date,
and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time.
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate if one is requested, must submit a written request
to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten
days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number;
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral
presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs. If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make
our final determination within 75 days of the signing of this preliminary determination.
This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

Issuance of final policy guidance section 306(d)(14) of the CZMA.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management is issuing final policy guidance on section 306(d)(14) of the
Coastal Zone Management Act, which requires that state coastal management programs provide public participation
in permitting decisions, consistency determinations, and other similar decisions. This final guidance follows
review and consideration of comments of draft guidance issued in the 

Federal Register

, Vol. 58, No. 212, Nov. 4, 1993, pp 58840-58841.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Authority




This guidance is issued pursuant to the authority of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1451-1464)


II. Background



The following guidance outlines OCRM standards for states and territories with Federally approved coastal management
programs, and those developing management programs, to meet the public participation requirement under the Coastal
Zone Management Act section 306(d)(14), as amended by Pub. L. 101-508, the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization
Amendments of 1990. This section states that before approving a management program submitted by a coastal state,
the Secretary of Commerce shall find that ``[t]he management program provides for public participation in permitting
processes, consistency determinations, and other similar decisions.''

The scope of this requirement extends to all activities that require specific or general authorization through permitting,
consistency review, or other means pursuant to the enforceable policies of the coastal management program, and applicable
state law. This guidance applies to all state authorizations subject to the statutory public participation requirement
and shall not conflict with existing state or Federal regulations pertaining to Federal permitting processes, state
permitting processes, and Federal consistency review of Federally permitted or licensed activities.


NOAA has reviewed public participation opportunities under state coastal zone management programs and has determined
that existing public participation procedures under state law satisfy the public participation requirement under
section 306(d)(14) for state permits. For applications under state general permits, public participation in the
review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing for a general determination of consistency with the
Federally approved state coastal management program will satisfy the public participation requirement. NOAA's
regulations already require public participation in state Federal consistency reviews of Federally permitted
or licensed activities.

Therefore, NOAA finds that section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only
on the state's review of Federal agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section
307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation
procedure.

The following guidance outlines an acceptable standard for meaningful public participation. State coastal zone
management programs will have one year to comply with this guidance. Within one year, each state is to: (1) Develop
public participation procedures for the review of direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA,
if necessary, and submit a copy of those procedures to OCRM as a program change or submit documentation that procedures
are already incorporated into the approved program and (2) conduct a review to determine if other public participation
procedures are necessary. If additional procedures are necessary, the state must submit a copy of the procedures
developed to OCRM as a program change. If no further procedures are needed, the state must submit to OCRM a notice that
a review has been conducted and that no additional procedures are necessary.

This guidance is sufficiently broad to give states flexibility in developing public participation procedures that
meet the intent of section 306(d)(14). OCRM will review each state's procedures during regularly scheduled evaluations
of state coastal zone management programs under section 312 of the CZMA for compliance with the public participation
requirement under section 306(d)(14), and will recommend procedural changes if necessary to meet OCRM's guidance.


III. Availability of Comments



All comments received in response to the notice of draft policy guidance (58 FR 58840, November 4, 1993) are available
for inspection at the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management during normal business hours (8:00 to 4:30 p.m.)
in room 11614, 1305 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland, 20910.


IV. Response to Comments



The following comments were received on the draft policy guidance. NOAA's response appears below:

<TEXT>
 



Comment:

 The draft language of the Policy Guidance itself does not clearly specify that the procedures apply only to consistency
reviews under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and other state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing
public participation procedure, although that fact is stated in the discussion preceding the guidance. 


Response: 

NOAA concurs and has added specific language in the guidance to clarify this point. 


Comment: 

Several states expressed concern that implementing this guidance will add to the state's administrative costs.



Response: 

NOAA is sensitive to this issue and structured the guidance to provide coastal states with a range options for implementing
the requirement in a cost-effective manner. 


Comment: 

NOAA should change the language under (a)(1) to say that ``States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice * * *''.


Response: 

Recognizing that this comment is consistent with the provision allowing for joint public notice with Federal agencies,
NOAA has clarified this point in the final guidance. 


Comment: 

The use of the word ``guidance'' coupled with the use of mandatory terms such as ``must'', ``mandatory'', and ``at
a minimum'' may be confusing. 


Response: 

This guidance represents NOAA's interpretation of the statutory requirement by outlining what it considers to be
effective public public participation. NOAA recognizes that the guidance itself is not the enforceable policy.
Rather, the obligation of coastal states to comply rests in the language of section 306(d)(14).


V. Guidance to Implement CZMA Section 306(d)(14)


Section 306(d)(14) imposes a new requirement for effective public participation only on the state's review of Federal
agency consistency determinations for direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) of the CZMA and any other
state coastal management decisions not now covered by an existing public participation procedure. For applications
under state general permits, public participation in the review of administrative procedures or regulations allowing
for a general determination of consistency will satisfy the public participation requirement. The public should
have an opportunity to comment on a project's relationship with the state coastal management program's goals and
policies. NOAA interprets the statute to require the following: 
(a) States must provide timely public notice. 
(1) States must issue, or cause to be issued, public notice at the earliest practicable time after the application
and/or consistency determination has been received by the lead state coastal management agency, except in cases
where earlier public notice on the consistency determinations by the relevant Federal agency meets OCRM's standards
for acceptable public notice listed below. 
(2) A public comment period must be provided. The length of the comment period may vary in accordance with state or Federal
law, and as appropriate for the type of authorization involved. However, the comment period must be sufficient to
give the public a meaningful opportunity to develop and provide comments. 
(b) Public participation, at a minimum, must consist of written public notice and solicitation of public comments.
Provision for a public hearing or meeting may also be provided. If a state chooses to use public hearings or public meetings
to provide for effective public participation, such hearings or meetings should be held in a location accessible
to most interested or affected parties to the maximum extent possible.
The written public notice must:
(1) specify that the proposed activity is subject to review for consistency uunder the policies of the state coastal
management program; 
(2) provide sufficient information to serve as a basis for meaningful comment; 
(3) specify a source for additional information; and 
(4) specify a contact for submitting comments to the state coastal management program. 
(c) At a minimum, the public notice must be provided in the area(s) of the coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity.
Procedural options that may be used include, but are not limited to, the options listed below.The use of one or more
of the following must also conform with the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above. 


(1) public notice through an official state gazette;
(2) public notice through a local newspaper serving areas of coastal zone likely to be affected by the activity; 
(3) public notice through individual state mailings; 
(4) public notice through a state coastal zone management newsletter; 
(5) arrangements between a state coastal management program and appropriate Federal agencies for joint public notice
to be provided by the state and Federal agency where direct Federal activities under section 307(c)(1) are involved
OCRM also encourages other streamlined procedures for providing public participation. Federal agency notice of
a proposed activity would suffice if it meets the guidelines set forth in (a) and (b) above.

Announcement of Opportunities for Research Funding in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System for Fiscal
Year 1995



<AGENCY>

Sanctuaries and Reserves Division (SRD), Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), National Ocean
Service (NOS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce (DOC).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Sanctuaries and Reserves Division of the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management is soliciting proposals
for funding research within the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The focus of funding for the upcoming
annual grant period is the restoration of estuarine and estuarine-like ecosystems. This notice sets forth funding
priorities, selection criteria, and procedures for proposal submission.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Authority and Background



Section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended (CZMA), 16 U.S.C. 1461, establishes the National
Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERRS). 16 U.S.C. 1461 (e)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to make
grants to any coastal state or public or private person for purposes of supporting research and monitoring within
a national estuarine reserve that are consistent with the research guidelines developed under subsection (c). This
program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under ``Coastal Zone Management Estuarine Research
Reserve,'' Number 11.420.



II. Information on Established National Estuarine Research Reserves



The NERRS consists of estuarine areas of the United States which are designated, developed, and managed for research
and educational purposes. Each National Estuarine Research Reserve (Reserve) within the NERRS is chosen to reflect
regional differences and to include a variety of ecosystem types in accordance with the classification scheme of
the national program as presented in 15 CFR part 921.

Each Reserve is suited to support a wide range of beneficial uses of ecological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic
value which are dependent upon maintenance of a healthy ecosystem. Each site provides habitat for a wide range of ecologically
and commercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Each
Reserve has been designed to ensure its effectiveness as a conservation unit and as a site for long-term research and
monitoring. As part of a national system, the Reserves collectively provide an excellent opportunity to address
research questions and estuarine management issues of national significance. For a detailed description of the
sites, contact individual site Managers and/or Research Coordinators. The on-site contacts and addresses of the
National Estuarine Research Reserves are provided in Appendix I.

III. Availability of Funds 


Funds are available on a competitive basis to any public or private university, qualified public or private institution,
individual, or coastal state (including Great Lakes States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa,
and the Northern Marianas Islands) to conduct research within National Estuarine Research Reserves. Because NOAA
has substantial involvement in the research, NERRS research funds are normally awarded through a cooperative agreement.
NOAA may be involved in the project in the following manner:

 


The Sanctuaries and Reserves Division (SRD), Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, reserves the right
to immediately halt activity on this project if it becomes obvious that the project is not fulfilling the mission of
the National Estuarine Research Reserve System goals. Day-to-day management is the responsibility of the Principal
Investigators, however, frequent guidance and direction is provided by the Federal Government for the successful
conduct of this project. Non-compliance with a Federally approved management plan may result in immediate halting
of the project. 

It is our intention to review and approve each stage of work before the next begins to assure quality scientific progression
and results that will produce viable information on which to form valid, productive coastal management decisions.

 


Managers, Research Coordinators, and all other staff at NERRS sites are ineligible to submit competitive research
proposals under this Announcement. In FY92 through FY94, SRD provided funding in the amount of approximately $700,000,
each year, for research in the NERRS. The approximate range of funding per successful project in recent years has been
between $30,000 and $70,000. In FY95, it is expected that approximately $700,000 will be available for funding new
one- and two-year projects at similar levels. Federal funds requested must be matched by the applicant by at least
30% of the total cost of the project. For example, it the total project cost is $10,000, the Federal share is $7,000,
the non-Federal match is $3,000.

 




Note: 

The match requirement was decreased from 50% to 30% by Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments of 1990.

 


The required match must be with cash or the value of goods and services directly benefiting the project in accordance
with 15 CFR part 24, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and
Local Governments,'' and OMB Circular A-110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements
with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Nonprofit Organizations.'' It is anticipated that
projects receiving funding under this announcement will begin in the spring/summer of 1995. Earliest anticipated
start date is May 1, 1995. Applicants not familiar with the requirements of a cooperative agreement or who need additional
information on application requirements are encouraged to contact SRD. 



IV. Purpose and Priorities 



Research funds are used to support management-related projects that will: enhance scientific understanding of
Reserve environments; provide information needed by Reserve Managers and coastal zone decision makers; and improve
public awareness of estuaries and estuarine management issues. Research projects may be oriented to specific Reserves;
however, projects that involve or benefit more than one Reserve in the national system will be given higher priority.


The primary research objective for the NERRS is the study of the causes and effects of natural and anthropogenically-induced
change in the ecology of esturaine and estuarine-like ecosystems. All research funded through SRD should be designed
to provide information of significant value to the development and implementation of resource management policy
governing the U.S. coastal zone, for which NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management has management
and regulatory responsibilities. Beginning in FY93, SRD established a series of two-year research priority categories
to serve as foci for the SRD competitive research program (see below). The FY95-96 research priority, which
is the subject of this notice, is habitat restoration. Every two years, SRD will review future research needs and establish
the next two-year research priority.

NERRS Research Priorities for FY 1993-1998





FY 1993, 1994: 

 Non-point Source Pollution.



FY 1995, 1996:

 Habitat Restoration.



FY 1997, 1998:

 Effects of Habitat Alteration on Coastal Biota.

Research proposals for FY95 should be designed to answer some aspect(s) of the following broad management-oriented
question: What are the most appropriate methods, experimental designs, models and/or evaluative criteria for restoring
estuarine and estuarine-like ecosystems? While this theme is the primary funding priority for SRD in FY95/96, consideration
may also be given to other projects of special merit that address other significant coastal management issues (e.g.,
non-point source pollution) on a regional or national scale. The availability of funding for such projects of special
merit will, however, be extremely limited, and will be determined after the primary research priority has been addressed.

Research proposals submitted in response to this announcement must: address coastal management issues identified
as having regional or national significance; relate them to the National Research Priority described in this announcement;
and be conducted (at least partially) within one or more designated NERRS sites. Research projects are funded for
a duration of either one or two years. Multiple year projects will always be initiated in the first year of a two-year
priority. One-year projects may be submitted in either year of a two-year priority. Therefore, proposals submitted
under this announcement for FY95 funding may be of one- or two-year duration.

The research topic and the Reserve must be carefully chosen to ensure that the resource management issues of primary
concern to the Reserve and the NERRS are addressed. Thus, it is critical that all prospective researchers contact
the appropriate Reserve manager or research coordinator before submitting a proposal responding to this announcement.



V. Guidelines for Proposal Preparation, Proposal Review and Evaluation, and Reporting Requirements



Applicants for SRD research funds must follow the guidelines presented herein when preparing pre-proposals and
proposals for research in Reserves. Pre-proposals and proposals not following these guidelines will be returned
to the applicant without further review.

Proposals for research in the NERRS are solicited annually for award the following fiscal year. Proposal due dates
and other pertinent information are contained in this announcement of research opportunities. All proposals sent
to SRD must cite and reference this 

Federal Register

 notice. Proposers must submit an original and two (2) copies of each proposal and all supporting documents (curricula
vitae, literature referenced, etc.).

Each proposal will be reviewed only as a one- or two-year project, as specified by the applicant. Applicants whose
pre-proposals are approved for further review must submit an original and two (2) copies of their full proposals as
well.



A. Pre-proposals



Pre-proposals will be used by SRD to evaluate the applicability of the research plan with regard to the goals of this
announcement. Pre-proposals may not exceed six (6) double-spaced pages including the abstract, introduction,
objectives, statement of hypothesis, brief methods description, and discussion of anticipated results and benefits.
A discussion of coordination with other research in progress or proposed is encouraged. Each pre-proposal must include
a cover page which lists principal investigator(s) name(s), address(es) and telephone number(s), proposal title,
name of institution providing matching funds, amount of Federal funds requested and amount of match, requested start
date (month), and site(s) where research is to be conducted. Curricula vitae (not to exceed 3 pages each) for each researcher
and a detailed budget showing matching funds must be included. The 6 double-spaced page limit does not include budget
and budget description, cover page, curriculum vitae, literature cited section, and any tables or figures. No Federal
forms need be submitted with a pre-proposal. The pre-proposal and additional sections should be submitted to CAPT
Francesca M. Cava at the address provided in the Addresses section. Receipt of all pre-proposals will be acknowledged
and a copy sent to the appropriate Reserve Manager. All pre-proposals will be reviewed by SRD research staff, the SRD
Headquarters Regional Managers and their staff, an outside technical review panel, and the relevant Reserve Manager,
Research Coordinator, and their research advisory committees, where applicable. Pre-proposals will be rated using
the criteria listed in section C below, ``Proposal Review and Evaluation.'' Applicants whose research projects
are selected for further consideration will be requested to submit full proposal. Applicants whose projects are
eliminated at this point will be notified.

Incomplete pre-proposals will be returned to the Principal Investigator without further review.



B. Full Proposals 



Full proposals may be submitted only by those individuals requested to do so following review of pre-proposals. Unsolicited
full proposals will be returned without review. One (1) original and two (2) copies of the proposal (including all
forms, curricula vitae, etc.) must be submitted to the same address as the pre-proposals. The proposal may not exceed
20 double-spaced pages, excluding Federal forms, table of contents, title page, literature cited, curricula vitae,
budget, and figures and table. Incomplete proposals will be returned without further review.

An Application Kit will be sent to those individuals who are requested to submit full proposals. This kit will include
all required Federal forms, with instructions, as well as SRD guidelines for content and format of the full proposal.

<TEXT>
 

C. Proposal Review and Evaluation


Pre-proposals will be reviewed as outlined in section A, ``Pre-proposals,'' above. All full proposals will be reviewed
by: SRD research staff; at least two outside individuals who are acknowledged experts in the particular field represented
by the proposal; and an outside panel of experts. Each full proposal is also forwarded to the appropriate SRD Regional,
State Coastal Zone Management, and Reserve staffs for comments. Verbatim copies of all peer reviews, excluding the
name of the reviewer, will be sent to the applicant. Applicants will have two weeks to address and rebut peer reviews.
These rebuttals will be considered by SRD when final funding decisions are made. All recommendations for funding
by SRD must be approved by the NOAA Grants Management Division before awards are made.
In order to provide for the fair and equitable selection of the most meritorious research projects for support, SRD
has established specific criteria for their review and evaluation. These criteria are intended to be applied to all
research proposals in accordance with the SRD Research Priorities set forth in this announcement. The criteria used
in both pre-proposal and full proposal review process are listed below, together with the elements that constitute
each criterion and their relative weights (in parenthesis):
1. Scientific Merit (40%). This criterion is used to evaluate whether the objectives of the proposal are: important
to the field; consistent with the stated national research priorities; and likely to improve the scientific understanding
of estuarine processes within the Reserve(s) as well as in other similar estuaries.
2. Technical Approach (40%). This criterion is used to assess: the technical feasibility of the proposed effort;
the reasonableness of the hypotheses; the degree to which the proposed timeline is realistic; the appropriateness
and scientific validity of the proposed analytical methods; the degree to which the proposal demonstrates an understanding
of the Reserve environment and management needs; the current state of knowledge in the particular field of research
interest; and the total research requirements.
3. Qualifications of P.I. and Key Personnel (10%). This criterion relates to the experience and past performance
of the principal investigator and key personnel, their familiarity with the geographic area of the proposed study,
and their publication record.
4. Institutional Support and Capabilities (5%). This criterion relates to the extent of the applicant institution's
support for and commitment to the proposed research and what facilities, equipment, and other resources are available
to the principal investigator and key personnel from his/her institution for use in accomplishing the proposed work.
5. Budget (5%). This criterion is used to determine whether the budget is realistic and reasonable for accomplishing
the proposed tasks.
The external panel will review and rank the proposals based solely on the technical criteria above. The panel will
submit its rankings to SRD. In making final funding decisions among qualified proposals ranked highly by the above
technical criteria, SRD will also take into consideration the following programmatic policy factors:
Utility to Reserve Management and to Regional Coastal Management Issues. This criterion is used to assess the likelihood
that results of this research will support the management of the affected Reserve(s) and will enhance wise coastal
resource management within the region(s) of study.
Relevance to National Research Priorities and Utility to National Coastal Management Issues. This criterion is
used to assess the relationship between the objectives of the proposed project and the National Research Priorities
established by NOAA, and to assess the likelihood that results of this research will be important to national coastal
management issues across the NERR System and coastal states.
Consequently, proposals ranked highest on technical criteria will not necessarily receive funding from SRD. Final
funding decisions will be made by the Chief of the Sanctuaries and Reserves Division, based upon review panel rankings
and programmatic considerations.


VI. Other Requirements


Recipients and subrecipients are subject to all Federal laws and Federal and DOC policies, regulations, and procedures
applicable to Federal financial assistance awards.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award Cooperative Agreement To University of Illinois</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based
on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) (B), (C), (D) and 600.14(d) to the University of Illinois, Department
of the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) under cooperative agreement number DE-FC01-94E124855.
The purpose of the proposed agreement is to revise the Energy Information Administration (EIA) demonstrated reserve
base (DRB) of coal for the State of Illinois, with new quantity/quality data. This agreement is necessary to achieve
program objectives, conserve public funds and is essential to the public interest. This effort will have a total estimated
cost of $83,000 to be provided by the DOE.


The (ISGS) is the State authority on Illinois coal resources. This agreement will assist the State of Illinois in its
efforts to continually collect analyses on coal quality and perform geological mapping to determine the quantity
and quality of coal reserves in the state.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The cooperative agreement will provide funding for the ISGS to develop Phase I Coal Reserves Data Base (CRDB) coal
resource data for updated estimates of the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) and recoverable reserves of coal in Illinois,
allocated to specified ranges of sulfur content and heat content. The DRB constitutes the foundation data for coal
reserve analyses. Recoverable reserve data derived from the DRB comprise the pivotal data base for analyzing future
coal supplies. Data development may include analyses of coal geology, resource quantities, coal quality characteristics,
and other factors that affect resource accessibility and minability. Data output must include remaining identified
resources, DRB, remaining accessible reserve base, recoverable reserves, allocated by coal rank, type of mining,
and (excepting identified resources) heat and sulfur content.


DOE has determined that the proposed agreement meets the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) (B), (C) and (D) in
that (1) The activities are being conducted by the applicant using its own resources or those donated or provided by
third parties; however, DOE support of that activity would enhance the public benefits to be derived and DOE knows
of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity, (2) the ISGS is a unit of state government
and the activity to be supported is related to performance of a governmental function within the subject jurisdiction,
thereby precluding DOE provision of support to another entity, and (3) the ISGS has exclusive domestic capability
to perform the activity successfully, based upon unique equipment, proprietary data and technical expertise, or
other such unique qualifications.
The ISGS is charged with the responsibility of mapping and estimating the coal resources for the State of Illinois
and possesses over 1,300 agency-collected analyses including sulfur contents and heat values. This data, along
with data from other sources, will enable them to revise the coal reserves by quality and mining method for Illinois.
No other private or government entity is known to have the data and mapping capability required to estimate the coal
reserves by quality for the State of Illinois.


Term: 

The term of the proposed cooperative agreement is expected to be 12 months from the effective date of award.



Issued in Washington, DC on June 6, 1994.

Ohio: Final Determination of Adequacy of State Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final determination of full program adequacy for Ohio's application. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste will comply with the revised Federal
Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule
for such determinations. The USEPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule
(STIR) that will provide procedures by which the USEPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal MSWLF permit
programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted.
Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy
determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may
use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important
benefit. Approved State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator
regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved
MSWLF permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by the revised Federal Criteria to the extent
the State/Tribe MSWLF permit program allows such flexibility. The USEPA notes that regardless of 
the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the revised Federal Criteria apply to all
permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities. 


Ohio applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. At the same time, Ohio proposed rule revisions
that would facilitate full approval of its solid waste program. The proposed rule revisions added definitions and
requirements that were no less stringent than portions of the revised Federal Criteria. The USEPA reviewed Ohio's
application and tentatively determined that Ohio's existing MSWLF permit program, along with the incorporation
of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria, would be adequate to assure compliance with the revised Federal
Criteria. Ohio successfully incorporated the needed portions of the revised Federal Criteria into its MSWLF permit
program and the revised regulations are now fully effective. Review of the finalized Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA) regulations occurred prior to the USEPA's final determination of program adequacy. After consideration
of all comments received during the public comment period, the USEPA is today issuing a final determination that the
State's program is adequate.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


A. Background


On October 9, 1991, the USEPA promulgated revised Federal MSWLF Criteria 
(40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires
States to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the revised Federal Criteria. Subtitle D
also requires in section 4005 that the USEPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure that facilities
comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill these requirements, the Agency has drafted and is in the process
of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal
programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.
The USEPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. The USEPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval
to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to the revised Federal Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, the USEPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authority to take specific action against any owner or operator who fails to comply with an approved MSWLF permit program.
The USEPA Regional offices will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation
outlined above. The USEPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. The
USEPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF permit program before it
gives full approval to a MSWLF permit program. As provided in the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA's national subtitle
D standards took effect on October 9, 1993. On October 1, 1993, the USEPA published a final ruling which modified the
effective date of the landfill criteria for certain classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). For certain small
landfills that accept less than 100 tons of waste per day, the Federal landfill criteria were not effective until April
9, 1994, instead of October 9, 1993. The exact classifications of landfills and details on the effective date extensions
are contained in the final rule. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993).



B. State of Ohio


On October 9, 1993, Ohio submitted an application to obtain a MSWLF program adequacy determination. On January 14,
1994, the USEPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of the Ohio program. Further background
information on the tentative determination of adequacy appears in 
59 FR 2406 (January 14, 1994). 
The current Ohio regulations, contained in the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC-3745-27), are considered
equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria. In its application, Ohio demonstrated that the State's revised permit
program would adequately meet all elements of the revised Federal Criteria. The USEPA reviewed the finalized OEPA
regulations prior to making today's final determination of program adequacy. The revised Ohio regulations were
officially adopted on 
May 2, 1994, by the Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), and the effective date of the requirements
which fully incorporate the revised Federal Criteria was June 1, 1994. The USEPA recognizes the complexity of the
rulemaking process in Ohio, and feels that an effective date of June 1, 1994, for revised State rules incorporating
the Federal Criteria is adequate. The revised 
OEPA regulations apply to all existing units designated by the landfill owner or operator, as well as all new units.
Along with the tentative determination, the USEPA announced the availability of the application for public comment
and the date of a public hearing on the application. A public hearing was held at the offices of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency in Columbus, Ohio, on March 1, 1994.



C. Comments


The USEPA received public comment concerning the tentative determination of full program adequacy for Ohio's MSWLF
permit program. One commenter suggested that the USEPA approve the State's existing groundwater sampling and analysis
procedures with regard to the field filtration requirement currently set forth in 40 CFR 258.53. The revised Federal
Criteria require unfiltered groundwater samples to be used in laboratory analysis. Currently, Ohio regulations
require sampling and analysis procedures which ensure monitoring results that provide an ``accurate representation''
of groundwater quality. Because this is currently interpreted to require unfiltered samples, the USEPA is approving
this provision of the State's program. However, the USEPA intends to revisit this issue during a proposed rulemaking.
If the proposed rulemaking upholds the ban on field filtering, the State has agreed to continue to incorporate the
provisions of 40 CFR 258.53(b) into its policy regarding groundwater sampling and analysis procedures.
One commenter expressed concern about the adequacy of OEPA's MSWLF permit program because it lacked provisions against
what the commenter referred to as ``strategic lawsuits against public participation.'' The commenter described
such lawsuits as preventing an individual or group from communicating their views to the government on public issues.
The revised Federal Criteria require a State/Tribe to provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement
as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA. The Ohio MSWLF permit program provides three opportunities for public involvement
during the permitting process. This 
process is delineated in the Ohio Revised Code(ORC), section 3734.05(a)(2)(d)-(f). The Ohio MSWLF program
further provides a verified complaint procedure, delineated in ORC section 3745.08, for members of the public who
are or will be aggrieved or adversely affected by a violation of the Ohio solid waste regulations. In addition, members
of the public may commence civil action against any person, the State, or a political subdivision alleged to be in violation
of the Ohio regulations by utilizing citizens' suit provisions delineated in ORC section 3734.101(A). It is the opinion
of the USEPA that the provisions detailed above and further explained in Ohio's application fulfill the requirements
of section 7004(b) of RCRA.
The same commenter also expressed concern regarding the adequacy of various other aspects of the Ohio MSWLF program,
such as staff and financial resources for effective implementation, organizational structure of the OEPA to support
the program, and administrative costs associated with the MSWLF permitting process. In its application for program
approval, Ohio described an organizational structure with staffing and financial resources that the State feels
will be appropriate to effectively support the permitting and enforcement activities associated with its MSWLF
permitting program. The USEPA feels that Ohio demonstrated that it will be able to provide adequate resources to effectively
administer and support its MSWLF permit program. Regarding the administrative costs associated with the MSWLF permitting
process, this issue lies outside the scope of the revised Federal Criteria.
Another commenter expressed concern regarding the proper implementation of the location restrictions for wetland
areas contained in the revised Federal Criteria (40 CFR 258.12) by the Ohio MSWLF permit program. The commenter acknowledged
that the Ohio regulations incorporating the Federal Criteria for wetlands location restrictions were adequate,
however, concern was expressed regarding implementation of this provision in actual practice. The commenter specifically
referenced a site located in Richland County, Ohio, where a permit is under consideration by the OEPA for a proposed
landfill which is adjacent to the Fowler Woods State Nature Preserve. A portion of the proposed site would displace
existing wetlands and be located immediately adjacent to sensitive wetland areas of the nature preserve area. He
referred to the application of the wetland restrictions, particularly in this situation, as being arbitrary and
subject to political influence. Another commenter noted that the application of the wetland restrictions in this
case is inconsistent with the intent of the revised Federal Criteria. 
The USEPA agrees with the commenter's opinion that the Ohio regulations, as written, incorporate the wetland restrictions
adequately to ensure compliance with the wetlands restrictions contained in the revised Federal Criteria 
(40 CFR 258.12). In addition, the USEPA shares the concern of the commenter that all portions of the revised Federal
Criteria are implemented appropriately and uniformly in actual practice. Since Ohio has properly adopted into regulation
the location restrictions for wetland areas contained in the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA has no reason to
not approve this portion of the Ohio MSWLF permit program. However, Ohio has been formally advised of the concerns
of the commenter as well as USEPA regarding the proper implementation of the location restrictions for wetlands.
Finally, one commenter expressed concern with the practice of allowing the applicant for a MSWLF permit to demonstrate
compliance with the regulations using its own contractors or consultants. The commenter noted the absence of independent
or State controlled field analysis of reports and data to confirm the accuracy of the information. The commenter also
suggested that the State should choose a consultant or contractor to perform the required demonstrations of compliance
with the regulations for individual MSWLF permit applications. 
The USEPA shares the concern of the commenter that all information and data submitted to the State which serve to support
MSWLF permitting decisions be performed properly and accurately. The USEPA is aware of the State's practice of extensively
reviewing all submitted information and data to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations. It is the opinion
of the USEPA that the procedures outlined in the Ohio application for adequacy determination will support the effective
implementation of the revised Federal Criteria. The issue of requiring independent or State chosen contractors
and consultants to provide data and information to support permitting decisions lies beyond the scope of the revised
Federal Criteria.



D. Decision 


After reviewing the public comment, I conclude that Ohio's application for adequacy determination meets all of the
statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Ohio is granted a determination of adequacy
for all portions of its MSWLF permit program.
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the revised Federal Criteria independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As the USEPA explained in the
preamble to the final revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA expects that any owner or operator complying with the provisions
in a State/Tribal program approved by the USEPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria.
See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. The USEPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of
the Administrative Procedures Act, 
5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's program are already in effect as a matter of State law. The USEPA's
action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply. Nor do these
requirements become enforceable by the USEPA as Federal law. Consequently, the USEPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.



Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order
12866.



Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this tentative approval will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This proposed
notice, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.






Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005, and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended;
42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6949a(c).

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>



June 6, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3221
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.






Note:

 The Commission has requested expedited review of these items by June 29, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18.






OMB Number: 

3060-0563.


Title: 

Section 76.915, Change in status of cable operator.


Action: 

Extension of currently approved collection.


Respondents: 

State or local governments, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden: 

465 responses; 2.39 hours average burden per response; 1,111 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses: 

Section 76.915 is used to determine whether or not a cable television system is subject to effective competition and
therefore, not subject to rate regulation under the 1992 Cable Act. If the collection of information was not conducted
under   76.915(b) and (d), the potential for franchise authority error in determining the presence of
effective competition would be unchecked and could lead to deregulation of cable rates for systems not subject to
effective competition in contravention of the 1992 Cable Act. Franchising authority decisions on petitions for
change in status must be made within 30 days after the pleading cycle set for in  76.915(a) closes. Franchising
authorities must notify the Commission within ten (10) days of any decision changing status. Unless the Commission
receives an opposition to such changes in status, the decision will become final 30 days after adoption by the franchising
authority.






OMB Number: 

3060-0564.

Needs and Uses: 

The requirements of this section are applicable to cable operators for which the basic service tier is regulated by
local franchising authorities or the Commission, or, with respect to a cable programming services tier, for which
a complaint has been filed with the Commission. The requirements of this section are applicable for purposes of rate
adjustments on account of external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Cable operators shall maintain their
accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, except as otherwise directed by the Commission.
Cable operators shall maintain accounts in a manner that will enable identification of appropriate costs and application
of the Commission's cost assignment and allocation procedures, to cost categories necessary for rate adjustments
due to changes in external costs and for cost-of-service showings. Such categories shall be sufficiently detailed
and supported to permit verification and audit against the company's accounting records. The Commission determined
that it will include a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issues pertaining to what cost accounting and
cost allocation requirements it should adopt on a permanent basis.





OMB Number: 

3060-0565.


Title: 

Section 76.944, Commission review of franchising authority decisions on rates for the basic service tier and associated
equipment.


Action: 

Extension of a currently approved collection.


Respondents: 

State or local governments, business or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response: 

On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden: 

2,000 responses; 40 hours average burden per response; 80,000 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses: 

Section 76.944 ensures that any participant at the franchising authority level in a ratemaking proceeding may file
an appeal of the franchising authority's decision with the Commission within 30 days of release of the text of the franchising
authority's decision. Oppositions may be filed within 15 days after the appeal is filed, and must be served on the party(ies)
appealing the rate decision. Replies may be filed 7 days after the last day for oppositions and shall be served on the
party(ies) to the proceeding. Commission review of appeals is necessary to ensure uniformity of interpretation
of these federal guidelines. Otherwise, rulings by state or local courts in different parts of the country could produce
varying and conflicting determinations about Section 623 and the Commission's Rules which could frustrate the purpose
of having federal guidelines.





OMB Number: 

3060-0569.


Title: 

Section 76.975, Commercial leased access dispute resolution.


Action: 

Extension of a currently approved collection.


Respondents: 

Individuals or households, businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Responses: 

On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden: 

500 responses; 8 hours average burden per response; 4,000 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses: 

Section 76.975 provides that (1) any person aggrieved by the failure or refusal of a cable operator to make commercial
channel capacity available or to charge rates for such capacity may file a petition for relief with the Commission;
(2) this petition must state concisely the facts constituting a violation of the FCC's leased access rules and the
specific rule or regulation violated, and certify that the petition for relief was served on the cable operator; and
(3) any petition for relief must be filed within 60 days of the alleged violation. A cable operator would then have 30
days from the date of filing the petition in which to respond. These requirements are designed to assure that the leased
access option brings about the intended diversity of programming and competition in programming delivery. The information
will be reviewed by FCC staff to resolved access disputes. These expedited leased access procedures may obviate the
need for oral rulings or other emergency processing of leased access disputes.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As previously indicated in Congressional testimony and in public statements, the FDIC has been at work on a fundamental
review of the process by which mutual thrifts convert to stock form. This request for comments reflects that study.
The intended effect of this notice is to obtain comments on the suggested approach to resolving fundamental concerns
about the current mutual-to-stock conversion process.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Historical Background 




Mutual savings institutions were founded to fill gaps in the market_and for a social purpose. Commercial banks have
not always welcomed retail customers as either depositors or borrowers. Mutual savings banks were in many respects
charitable organizations designed to encourage and facilitate thrift on the part of urban wage-earners. Their trustees
were self-perpetuating groups of leading citizens, some of whom may have contributed the capital to establish the
bank in the first place, who took no fees and did no business with the bank. Savings and loan associations were essentially
cooperatives. One became a ``member'' in order to save_in order eventually to borrow the money to build a home. There
were limitations on the ability to withdraw one's funds. The right to be the next borrower, when enough funds had accumulated,
was often decided by lot. Trustees were elected by the members_and in the early days members were required to attend
meetings and take their turn as officers. The notion of ``self-help'' motivated both sorts of formations. At one time,
people spoke of the spread of these institutions as a ``movement.'' 




As a legacy of that tradition, today there are approximately 1,100 mutuals in the United States. (Ten years ago there
were about 2,500, five years ago 1,775.) From time to time, one or another of them desires to convert to stock form. It
may be that they need more capital_in some cases on an urgent basis. It may be that they see expansion opportunities
and need a currency (stock) with which to acquire. For many small institutions, it makes sense to join a larger organization,
and they often need to convert to be able to do so. Based on our own research and analysis, as well as published cases,
there is also little question that some institutions have converted primarily to enrich those who controlled them.

The existing form of transaction by which both federal and state mutuals convert was developed by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board (``FHLBB'') in 1974. What happens, essentially, is that the mutual sells itself, for cash, to whoever
buys its newly issued stock. Various categories of potential purchasers get priority. In general, depositors stand
at the head of the line. To the extent depositors and others with priority rights do not subscribe for stock, an attempt
is made to sell it locally. If stock is still left over, it is sold to investors with no particular connection to the converting
institution. 


The FHLBB was conscious, when it first wrote rules for conversions, that there might be value to the right to subscribe
for stock in a conversion. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth raised only $20 million of new capital
in converting, whoever got to buy the stock would have a claim on $120 million of net worth. In such a situation, the stock
would almost certainly be worth much more than the buyers had paid for it. For about a year, in the early '70s, the FHLBB
took the view that rights to buy stock in a converting institution should be distributed to its depositors, who could
either exercise and become owners or sell the rights for their intrinsic value. 


The FHLBB subsequently abandoned this approach, however, primarily out of concern that depositors would shift funds
from association to association, hoping to capture the intrinsic value of the rights when the conversion occurred_and
on a scale that could be destabilizing. At the same time, it adopted the current approach, which included an ``appraisal''
requirement, providing that a converting institution issue and sell its capital stock at a total price equal to the
estimated 

pro forma 

value of such stock in the converted institution. 


Because of moratoria imposed in 1973 and 1974, the existing form of transaction was not tested in great numbers until
the '80s. At that point, it worked quite well, because many converting institutions had little net worth or economic
value, and the market was extremely wary even of those that did. Depositors and other investors who subscribed for
stock got securities with a market value approximately equal to what they paid for them. 



Problems With the Existing Process 




In the last two-plus years, as non-viable institutions have been closed and the industry has returned to health, the
existing form of transaction has delivered windfalls to those who subscribed. In the more than 100 standard conversions
in 1992 and 1993, the trading price at the end of the first day has exceeded the subscription price by, on average, 26%.
In 40 instances, this price increase (the ``pop'') has exceeded 30%; in 6 instances it exceeded 50%. 


As it has become obvious to everyone familiar with the process that buying stock in a conversion is an easy way to make
money, a class of `'professional depositors'' has emerged_wealthy individuals and investment partnerships with
$50 to $500 accounts at literally hundreds of mutuals across the country. Investment banking firms active in the conversion
arena advise us that there are perhaps 500 to 1,000 such professional depositors, and that they can take the account
list of almost any mutual in the nation and recognize hundreds of names at sight. These professional depositors buy
the maximum amount of stock allowed_and consequently the overwhelming majority of the stock issued in almost every
conversion. Market participants have told us that in a typical conversion, less than 5% of depositors participate
at all_and that the majority of them are professionals or insiders.

Giving depositors the 

opportunity 

to subscribe for stock has not resulted in broad distribution of stock among them. The vast majority of depositors
in mutual savings institutions keep their savings there precisely because they are risk-averse. They are likely
to read and ignore or discard the offering circular. The money they keep in a savings institution has been put aside
for retirement, or for emergencies, or for the down payment on first house, and cannot be invested in an initial public
offering. They do not participate. The existing conversion process does not benefit them at all.

As it has become obvious to everyone who understands the process that the stock of converting institutions often trades
up sharply on the first day of issue, those who control mutual institutions have become more and more interested in
converting. Managers and even non-executive trustees have been awarded free stock and options (at the subscription
price). Employee Stock Ownership Plans (``ESOPs'') have been created and given priority in buying stock. These and
other devices have resulted in substantial transfers of value.
 
As it has become clear that most conversions would be oversubscribed, the ``allocation'' process has clearly been
subject to abuse. For example, we have been told that in transactions where allocations were likely to be based on size
of deposit because of expected oversubscription, insiders and others in a position to know the relevant record date
have been able to transfer large amounts of money into their accounts on that single day. Where the right to subscribe
has been limited to long-term depositors, or depositors with local addresses, we are told that professionals are
sometimes able to persuade other depositors to ``front'' for them (despite rules to the contrary). 



Problems With Appraisals 



As market valuation of thrifts has risen (and as conversions have come to be oversubscribed, with stocks generally
trading up), the integrity of the appraisal process has been compromised. The FDIC's experience with appraisals
is that they typically follow a certain pattern. A ``peer group'' of stock savings institutions is identified. (How
they were selected out of the much larger universe of potential ``peers'' typically is not well explained.) The peer
group market/book ratio is calculated. It is then stated that the converting institution should be valued (on a pro
forma basis) at a discount from that ratio. Two reasons for this are typically given. The first is that the converting
mutual is actually inferior to the peer group_which raises the question, why were they chosen as peers in the first
place. The second, discussed below, is the need for a ``new issue discount.'' (Price/earnings ratios are also calculated,
but there is rarely a cogent analysis of the converting institution's earnings potential once it appropriately deploys
its new capital.) 

At March 31, 1994, the thrift industry average market/book ratio was 99% and the median was 95%. (At year-end 1993,
those figures were five percentage points higher, a year before that 15 percentage points lower.) The market tends
to value recently converted institutions below the industry average_primarily, in our judgment, because the return
on a newly converted institution's book, or capital, will be low by industry standards until it is able to leverage
the new capital it raises in the conversion. During 1992 and 1993 as a whole, the average market/book ratio of a newly
converted institution, at the end of the first day of trading, was 72%. To meet the ``appraisal'' requirement that
an institution's stock trade at what it was sold for in a situation where a 72% market/book ratio was a reasonable expectation,
a mutual would have to more than triple its capital base. To be precise, a mutual with a $100 million net worth would need
to raise $257 million (ignoring expenses and the effects of establishing an ESOP or a management retention plan),
since 72% of $357 million (the resulting book value) equals $257. It is extremely hard for a company in a highly competitive
industry prudently to employ that much new capital. 

What appraisal firms did, in 1992 and 1993, was to ``appraise'' converted institutions on average at 57% of book. They
did this despite the fact that, on average, these institutions traded up the first day by 26%. 

Appraisers' principal rationalization for this discrepancy has been that, in the context of an initial public offering,
a ``new issue discount'' is required. While it is certainly true that it is difficult to bring a company public without
pricing the shares at a level that stimulates unfilled demand_resulting in a ``pop''_we question the magnitude required
in an environment where virtually all conversions are trading up. In some circumstances, the need for a ``new issue
discount'' has been asserted in appraisal updates issued 

after

 the end of the subscription period, and in the face of 100-300% oversubscriptions. We would also observe that
the literal language of the OTS regulations and guidelines on conversion appraisals does not allow for a market discount.
The question to be answered is: how much stock has to be sold to eliminate any ``pop''?

We suspect that the practices we describe developed over time as appraisers, and mutuals and their advisers, attempted
to deal in good faith with the inherent contradictions of, on the one hand, a form of transaction perfectly suited to
institutions on the brink of failure, or which the market feared, and, on the other, a thrift industry that has returned
to health. 

As a footnote to the conversions of the 80's, it is worth observing that many institutions which emerged with very high
capital ratios were so anxious to earn a good return for their new, demanding stockholders, that they grew their balance
sheets more quickly than they should have and took risks they did not fully understand. A total of 77 New England savings
banks converted in the years 1984 through 1989; these transactions increased their weighted average capital ratio
to 15.2% from 6.6%; 16 of them (or 21%) subsequently failed.

1

 In addition, the rush by converted institutions to increase assets quickly tended to reduce credit standards throughout
the market, imperiling other institutions. 





Changing the Process 



What this history demonstrates is the need for fundamental change: 

 The ``appraisal'' process puts the government in the awkward position of substituting its judgement for that
of the market... 

  . . . and forces most converting institutions to raise far more capital than they can prudently
deploy... 

  . . . but still fails to eliminate windfalls. 

 This has put well-intended individuals involved in more than a few conversions in the ethically uncomfortable
position of pretending the appraisal requirement is met when they know it isn't. 

 The required form of transaction transfers the existing value of the mutual to a small group of individuals
with the cash, sophistication and risk appetite to buy the stock. 

 Because value is being ``given away,'' the process invites insider abuse. And because the value has to go somewhere,
the ingenuity of market participants eventually frustrates attempts to eliminate the problem. 

We share with others a desire to address problems arising under the existing rules. We do not in any way want to prevent
valid conversions from taking place_nor encourage conversions that fail to meet a valid business need. We also desire
that our handling of conversions be generally consistent with that of the OTS. 

For these reasons we are publishing elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule which: (a) reaffirms our intention to review conversion applications submitted by state-chartered
nonmember insured savings banks (and applications for insurance from newly established associations to be owned
by mutual holding companies), and (b) explicitly establishes certain criteria which are comparable to those of the
OTS. 

At the same time, we feel it is only fair to put the public on notice that we believe it may be difficult for a healthy mutual

to develop a sound business plan while raising enough new capital to receive a valid appraisal.

The noted investment manager, Peter Lynch, describes this problem, and the existing form of conversion generally,
in graphic terms. Buying stock in a converting mutual, he writes, is like going to an automobile dealer to buy a car,
giving him a check for the purchase price, and discovering on the way home that the dealer has put your check in the glove
compartment of the car. Unless the car is an extraordinary lemon, this is bound to be a good deal. And increasing the
size of the check_which is what ``disciplining the appraisal process'' amounts to_won't make it stop being a good
deal. 

It is possible that the recent OTS amendments (and the requirements in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned above) which
aim to give long-term, local depositors more rights_but within the framework of the existing form of transaction_may
produce similarly frustrating results. As noted earlier, ``real'' depositors are not going to benefit, no matter
what priorities they receive, because ``real'' depositors still may not subscribe in significant numbers. 

We believe that ``insider abuse,'' which is the focus of much recent discussion and of several of the OTS amendments
and the requirements of the FDIC proposed rule, is only a piece of the problem. In one recent conversion, for example,
state authorities forced the institution to rescind stock grants which would have benefited insiders by approximately
$40 million. 

This was laudable. But the ``pop'' in the price of the converted institution's shares benefited those who subscribed
by more than $200 million on the first day of trading and by $275 million after one month's trading. All who had their
subscriptions filled were depositors_but only 5% of all depositors subscribed. We question whether it can be an adequate
response to the trustees' fiduciary duty to deliver that much value to the tiny fraction of a mutual institution's
depositors with the capacity to line up and collect it. 

We continue to believe_as stated in testimony before the Congressional Banking Committees_that the conversion
process is fundamentally flawed. Thus, in addition to the proposed rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 (which is intended to address concerns within the existing mutual-to-stock conversion framework) we also are issuing
this request for comments seeking views on an approach which might address the basic flaws in the existing scheme.




The (Misguided) Question of ``Ownership'' 



The most vexing question facing everyone who has ever dealt with mutual-to-stock conversions is: ``Who owns mutuals?''
That may be the wrong way to ask the question. As indicated earlier, mutuals were originally closer to charities or
community organizations than to commercial enterprises. As a by-product of doing what they were founded to do, they
have accumulated net worth. The trustees hold that value in trust. The right question more likely should be: ``If the
trustees decide to convert, to whom should that value be delivered?'' 

We believe there are two ways to answer the question: leaving it to the trustees in the reasonable exercise of their
fiduciary duty, or legislation. 

Leaving the decision to the trustees is logical, but may be impractical. The best argument in favor of this approach
is that the history and circumstances of institutions vary, that boards are designed to balance competing interests
and considerations, that existing law should be adequate to prevent abuse, and that the government should not interfere
unless it has to. As different boards of trustees wrestle with the issues, a consensus should 

tend

 to emerge. 

The argument against leaving the decision to the trustees is twofold. Taking the positive view of such boards, it places
an unfair burden on them and their institutions. They will be lobbied by potential claimants. Someone will object
to whatever decision they make. Taking the skeptical view_and there is no question that 

some

 boards have interpreted their fiduciary responsibilities rather loosely_leaving the decision to the trustees
is unwise. The FDIC will in the end have to expend significant resources providing informal guidance to the conscientious
and making sure that trustees' determinations 

are

 reasonable. 

Some could well believe that the preferable way to answer the question of ``to whom the value should be delivered''
would be legislation. In fact, the main purpose of this notice and request for comments is to solicit views from the
public on a legislative proposal that the FDIC could prepare and present to the appropriate legislative body(ies).
Legislation could take the form of state law, through which each state would decide the question for the mutual banks
it charters (or has chartered), or federal legislation, through which the Congress decides the issue on a nationwide
basis. Uniformity argues for federal legislation, but questions of federal preemption of state law would have to
be considered. 

If federal legislation is decided upon, the Congress could either establish in the statute explicit value-distribution
rights or authorize the appropriate federal agency (presumably, the FDIC for state savings banks and the OTS for federal
and state savings associations) to determine to whom the value of the mutual institution should be delivered.

Who Should Get the Value? 



We are aware of at least seven groups (in no particular order) which might lay a claim to a mutual's value: 

(1) Depositors. 

(2) Other creditors, including holders of subordinated debt. 

(3) Borrowers. 

(4) Employees_whether through the medium of an ESOP, which acquires shares in the conversion, or other arrangements
designed for senior management. 

(5) Trustees. 

(6) The Bank Insurance Fund or the Savings Association Insurance Fund, the U.S. Treasury or the relevant state government.


(7) Charitable organizations or trusts serving the community and purposes for which the converting institution
was originally founded. 

The question of who receives the value is primarily a political one. Accordingly, we do not believe the FDIC should
be the one to decide among these (or other) claimants. We have a supervisory interest in seeing the question answered,
however, and answered in a way that is generally seen to be sensible and fair.

2

 To that end, the following comments are intended to focus public discussion of the question. 





Taking each of the seven parties in turn, we believe that at least some of the value will have to go to depositors. Although
the law of many states implies that they are not ``owners'' of mutual institutions in the classic sense of the term,
and, at least since the creation of the FDIC, they have not borne significant risk, they have supplied the institution
with its resources and in many cases have a vote on conversion. Although we have scant sympathy for those professional
depositors who have opened small accounts in the expectation of large windfalls and whose hopes would be disappointed
by the reforms we propose, it is perhaps the case that some depositors of all types have known that conversion was a possibility,
and in a sense may have ``bargained for'' at least some share of the value of the institution. The fact that existing
OTS regulations and most states' laws give savings and loan association depositors preference in subscribing for
stock may not create an 

entitlement

, but it has probably created an 

expectation

_which will probably have to be satisfied to some degree. 



Among

 depositors, there are questions of allocation: by size, by tenure, by address. What is theoretically desirable is
often beyond the scope of the converting institution's data processing systems. Attempts to favor ``local'' depositors
can be frustrated in various ways. There is also the question of record date_and the problem of long-term depositors
who unwittingly close their accounts shortly before the record date. Our current inclination would be to make the
record date fairly recent (as a convenience) and to award one share of the aggregate value going to depositors for each
year that each account has been open. We expect that allocating shares to accounts closed prior to the record date,
while theoretically equitable, would prove impractical. 

In contrast to depositors, creditors are uninsured and do take risk_especially since the adoption of federal depositor
preference. On the other hand, most creditors have that status as an incident of some other relationship_

e.g.

, as a supplier of goods and services_and would be surprised (if delighted) to discover that it gave them any claim on
the value of the institution. We would therefore expect a consensus to emerge favoring their exclusion. 

The argument for giving debtholders part of the value is stronger. They have the position they do because of a conscious
financial transaction. In most cases, such debt is subordinated and does represent capital. Debtholders, while
subordinating themselves to depositors for a higher rate of return, did not ``bargain for'' any share of the mutual's
net worth_but neither did most depositors. Were it to be established that subordinated debtholders were entitled
to a share of the value, it might make it slightly easier for small mutuals to raise debt capital, which has appeal from
a safety and soundness standpoint. As an equitable approach and from our perspective as insurer, we would favor giving
debtholders some of the value of a converting institution, and we would not expect such a decision to strike people
as unreasonable or unfair. 

If such a decision is made, we believe the most feasible method of allocation is by size of holding, with debtholders
as a whole receiving a share of the value going to debtholders and depositors combined that is proportionate to debt's
share of the institution's combined liability to depositors and debtholders. The length of time the debt has been
outstanding, or in any particular holder's hands in the case of tradable debt, should not, in our judgement, have bearing.

Federal Home Loan Bank advances are an important part of the liability structure of many banks. The question arises:
if other debtholders should receive some of the value of a converting institution, why not the relevant Federal Home
Loan Bank? We believe there is a good reason for excluding them: the fact that advances are fully secured, making the
Banks effectively senior to depositors. 
Although borrowers are technically ``members'' of some mutual savings institutions, we believe most borrowers
think of the institution as having a claim on them, rather than the reverse. During that period when they are borrowers,
they are in fact already receiving a benefit. Borrowers are typically required to open deposit accounts as well. Finally,
borrowers' loans can be, and often are, sold to third parties; distinguishing their rights from those of borrowers
whose loans have not been sold would present formidable legal and logistical challenges. For all these reasons, we
do not believe the consensus would be to give them a claim, as borrowers, on the value being transferred. 
We would point out, however, that at least some knowledgeable observers view the rights of depositors to a share of
the converting institution's value as not really that much stronger than those of borrowers. The vast majority of
both groups do business with mutuals on an arms-length basis, at market terms, at no significant risk, and with no expectation
of a windfall. In the view of some observers, it is only the absence of any other ``owners,'' the fact that depositors
turn up on the side of the balance sheet where stockholders would be if there were any, and the practice of treating depositors
as stand-ins for owners that give depositors the presumption of a right to receive value. 


Rewarding Employees and Managers 


It is sometimes said that managers_and to a lesser degree employees_of mutual institutions enjoy more job security
and a less demanding work environment that their counterparts at organizations subject to stockholder discipline,
but are in turn less well compensated. Conversion changes their situation. Some argue that these considerations_and
years of loyal service_entitle managers to a share of the value. The opposing view is that managers of mutuals chose
to work there and ``bargained for'' whatever pay they got. 
We understand both sets of arguments. The no-entitlement view, if we can call it that, has logical purity. The view
that managers deserve part of the value has emotional appeal, especially when they have spent decades at the converting
institution. The issue of appropriate treatment of long-serving employees is a good example of the essentially political
nature of the value-distribution question.

Were we required to decide this issue without legislative guidance, we would prefer to see all benefits to employees
of insured institutions be delivered as 

compensation. 

We would certainly endorse the creation of an ESOP immediately after conversion. If the conversion process has entailed
extra effort on the part of some (or all) employees, they may be entitled to bonuses. And if conversion entails a radical
reduction in job security, it may be appropriate to adopt a severance policy consistent with standard industry practice
for stock institutions. 
Focussing on the top few executives and non-executive trustees, it is certainly the case that their jobs become harder
and less secure following conversion. They may be entitled to significant raises. It may be appropriate for a few senior
executives to receive employment contracts. Again, all such steps should be evaluated within the context of ``compensation.''
We believe that for individuals who control the conversion transaction to lay any claim, in their capacity as managers
and trustees, to a portion of the value being transferred creates a conflict of interest. 
It is currently common practice for converting institutions to create stock option plans. We believe it is appropriate
for stock institutions to have incentive compensation plans of this type. As indicated in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned
above, we agree with the OTS that such plans should, at the earliest, be adopted at the first stockholders' meeting
following conversion and that the exercise price for any such options should be set at that time, rather than being
based on the conversion price. The latter practice, which had been common, gave those who controlled the transaction
an incentive to underprice the shares, and masked transfers of value to those executives receiving options, which,
if properly measured, and viewed as compensation, would have been deemed excessive. 


A ``Government'' Share? 


Several individuals and organizations have suggested that a share of the existing value of converting mutuals should
go to one of the deposit insurance funds, or to the U.S. Treasury, or to the government of the state which chartered the
institution. We are uncomfortable with the first suggestion. Converting institutions have been paying premiums,
just as stock institutions have. No one would lay claim to a portion of the latter's net worth. The FDIC should not do
so with regard to mutuals. 
Some have advanced the argument_based on the cost of the savings and loan crisis_that taxpayers generally, through
the medium of the Treasury, should get a portion of the value that conversion releases. As a fairness matter, we believe
this argument is flawed: Institutions now converting have 

not

 failed, and have 

not

 cost taxpayers anything. Most state savings banks, whose conversions fall under our jurisdiction, are insured by
the Bank Insurance Fund, which taxpayers have not had to support. 
Another argument for conveying the value of converting mutuals to the government_whether state or federal_is that
``no one owns them,'' and that the fairest course is therefore to avoid giving the value to anyone in particular. We
will have more to say on this topic later in this Notice, but would observe that if the form of transaction suggested
below is adopted, many of those who receive the value of the institution will get cash, and will pay taxes on it as income,
giving government its ``share.'' 


Fulfilling Mutuals' Original Purpose? 


As indicated earlier, mutuals were created for reasons that have now largely disappeared. Ordinary citizens have
plenty of places to put their savings. A host of private- and public-sector entities facilitate home-ownership.
The trustees of a mutual savings institution having regard for their fiduciary duties might liken their situation
to that of the board of the March of Dimes, which had to redefine its mission after polio ceased to be a major threat. From
that perspective, it may be appropriate for a portion of the value of a converting mutual to be transferred to one of
more community organizations or charities.

This approach raises the question, ``

Which 

organizations?''_which could be extremely hard to answer. As with the matter of dividing up the value in the first
place, leaving the decision to the trustees places a burden on them. Nevertheless, under this approach, the trustees
are the ones to decide. If no appropriate vehicles existed, a trust might be established to receive the transferred
value and make grants over time. The responsibility for allocating funds is borne by thousands of trustees of colleges
and hospitals and foundations and charities all over the country; there are plenty of examples to follow_and laws
to prevent abuse. 
An alternative to endowing a new or existing charitable organization is for the converted institution to accept special
obligations to serve the convenience and needs of the community for banking services. This is a very broad subject,
which we are not prepared to explore exhaustively here. We would make three basic points, however. First, while all
banks clearly have public obligations, it seems likely that imposing different burdens on institutions which are
otherwise direct competitors will ultimately create safety and soundness concerns. For that reason alone we would
oppose this approach. 
Second, the value transfer inherent in an institution's voluntary acceptance of a special obligation to the community_

e.g.,

 a promise to make affordable housing loans, or to open branches in distressed neighborhoods_is difficult to measure
against immediately cashable value delivered to depositors or others. We think it would be difficult for trustees
to know what they'd actually done. 
Third, the history of mutual savings banks does suggest that organizations to which any portion of the value of a converting
institution might be transferred should be locally focussed, and should have the encouragement of self-help as a
major objective. To give only two of many possible examples, helping to capitalize a community development bank,
or establishing a day care facility which permitted single mothers to work, would have satisfying historic resonance.



No Entitlement; No Forced Conversion 


The idea that some of the value of a converting institution should be delivered to the ``community'' it was chartered
to serve is as strongly opposed by some as it is supported by others. This is another excellent example of the political
(rather than regulatory) character of the issue. 
At least two arguments against a ``community'' share have been advanced. The first is that the ``wrong'' charities
and community organizations would be chosen_wrong from the speaker's point of view, that is_because of their skill
and persistence in lobbying the board. The second is that such organizations, seeing latent wealth available, would
put pressure on boards to convert. 
This second argument is also advanced, as it was in the early '70s, against giving 

depositors 

transferrable rights: if value is ``available,'' they will put pressure on institutions to convert. 
Being 

exempt 

from constituent ``pressure'' is unhealthy for any organization. Legislators have to face the voters. Independent
agencies are subject to oversight. Stock organizations can be taken over. We do not believe that the trustees of mutuals
should be allowed to ignore completely the views of those the institution exists to serve. 
Nevertheless, we would emphasize that however one decides the value-distribution issue, that does 

not 

answer the (misguided) question, ``Who owns a mutual?'' It does not, in our view, give anyone standing to demand that
an institution convert_any more than a group of private citizens could demand that the Red Cross ``convert''! Conversion
is a decision for the trustees, and until they make such a decision, the FDIC will not get involved_except where inadequate
capital makes it desirable from a safety and soundness standpoint. Mutuality has a distinguished history in America.
In the aggregate, mutuals have cost the FDIC proportionately less than have stock institutions. We would not endorse
a system that compelled mutual institutions to change their character. 


New Form of Transaction 


Having adopted 

an 

answer to the question, ``Who gets the existing value?'', the problem of delivering that value is easier to address.
We would suggest the following approach: 
 The trustees decide how much capital they need to raise as a business matter. (There is no ``appraisal'' process.)

 The trustees hire underwriters to conduct an initial public offering_and an escrow agent for the purposes
described below. 
 Rights to subscribe for the stock of the converted institution are distributed to ``rightholders'' in accordance
with the principles outlined above. 
 Each of these rights will have value. For example, if a mutual with $100 million of net worth elected to raise
$20 million, and distributed 4 million rights to buy 4 million shares (at $5 each), and the market valued the converted
institution at 80% of resulting book (or $96 million), the shares would trade at $24 each, and the right to buy a share
for $5 would be worth $19. 
 The rights would be ``transferrable'' only in the sense that, at the end of the subscription period, the escrow
agent would exercise on behalf of any rightholder who had not done so, turn the stock over to the underwriter for sale,
give $5/share of the proceeds to the company and send the difference to the rightholder.

<TEXT>
 

It is likely, under this form of transaction, that very few rightholders would chose to exercise, and that the underwriters
would essentially be selling the whole institution. This gives rise to several questions. For example, wouldn't
the transaction costs be awfully high, relative to the amount of new capital being raised? The answer has to be yes_but
the cost should be measured relative to the major strategic accomplishment of conversion itself; presumably there
was a reason to convert, or the trustees wouldn't have undertaken it. It is also worth observing that the need (opportunity)
to sell nearly 100% of the stock will lead many more underwriting firms to compete for the business. 
Another question is why not just distribute stock certificates instead of rights? The basic answer is that the selling
effort of a public offering is what gets the market to focus on the fair value of the shares, and gets a group of underwriters
committed to make a market in them afterwards. A direct distribution of shares could saddle the bank with an uneconomically
large number of shareholders. It would leave unsophisticated holders of small numbers of shares in danger of being
persuaded to sell at prices below intrinsic value. Finally, to the extent that rights were distributed to a community-oriented
charity, a stock sale should probably be required to avoid leaving a controlling block of stock in the hands of a foundation
or organization which might be governed by the directors of the converted mutual. 
One argument advanced against this form of transaction is that the existing process has raised enormous amounts of
money to recapitalize ailing thrifts, and that while the industry is healthy now, we may need to be able to do that again
some day. True_but the approach here proposed would be able to do that as well. If a thrift with a low equity ratio wanted
to convert, it could distribute rights and hire an escrow agent and an underwriter, just the same. The shares could
be priced wherever they had to, to be sold. The rights just wouldn't have much value_but that would appropriately reflect
the institution's perilous condition. 
Another argument advanced is that the recent market is a highly unusual one, that the embarrassing increases in share
price on the day of conversion have already begun to shrink and could soon disappear. They may or may not_and ``pops''


per se, 

though on a more modest scale, are effectively a requirement of the initial public offering market_but the transactions
the existing conversion process requires would still be inefficient to the point of being improper. Under current
rules, a well capitalized thrift is only able to avoid a ``pop'' by increasing its equity ratio to the point where its
market/book ratio falls below industry norms_which says that a lot of the new capital will either be underutilized
for several years, or used imprudently. What all parties at interest should want is the 

highest 

market/book ratio that can be obtained, because that suggests the right business judgements have been made regarding
capital structure and growth prospects. The elimination of ``pops'' would suggest a destruction of the value the
trustees hold in trust, and a violation of their fiduciary duty of care_regardless of who that duty is owed to. 


Merger Conversions 


The OTS interim final rule would prohibit merger conversions_whereby a stock institution acquires the assets and
assumes the liabilities of a mutual with no significant payment to anyone_except where the survival of the converting
institution is in question. The form of transaction we here propose would permit merger conversions, but would make
them essentially a purchase of subscription rights by the acquiror, with the value paid for the rights_either in cash
or other consideration_going to rightholders. This would have efficiency benefits for those smaller institutions
whose decision to convert flowed from a decision to affiliate with a larger organization. Trustees who decided to
convert and be acquired would of course have the same obligation to get the best possible price for rightholders.

Mutual Holding Companies



The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act
of 1989 authorized conversion of mutual savings institutions into federal mutual holding companies, which in turn
transfer virtually all their assets and liabilities to new, stock savings institutions, part of whose stock is acquired
by subscribers in the conversion, with the majority retained by the mutual parent. This structure has the benefit
of permitting converting institutions to raise only the amount of new capital they actually need. It has, however,
in our view, potential for even a higher level of insider abuse than in standard conversions. We note that many newly
formed mutual holding companies propose to refuse dividends declared by their operating subsidiary_with no corresponding
change in their percentage ownership of the subsidiary as dividends flowed to its minority stockholders. It seems
to us that this could constitute a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the trustees_which would be particularly
acute were the trustees significant stockholders of the subsidiary. (It is worthy of note that ``pops'' in conversions
involving mutual holding have been in the 40% range, compared to 26% for standard conversions.) As our suggested form
of standard conversion would eliminate the need to raise excessive amounts of capital, we believe use of the mutual
holding company structure should be discouraged in future conversions.



Summary



As we have studied the mutual-to-stock conversion process, it has become clear that there are two intertwined problems
to be solved. One is technical: how to do it? The other is political: who should get the value? The first problem is interesting
and challenging, but the second one is fundamental.

Deciding who should get the value makes a lot of people uncomfortable. Almost every answer makes someone angry. As
we read the history, the FHLBB settled on the existing form of transaction precisely because it allowed them to avoid
answering the value-distribution question. We have come to believe that the primary appeal of some value-distribution
schemes_

e.g.

, giving it to depositors or to ``the government''_is that they appear to disperse value enough to make the issue moot.
As we have discussed the subject over the past two months, we have observed how tempting it is to continue to avoid it.
Lawyers and investment bankers and professional depositors with a vested interest have urged us to drop the subject_which
is not surprising. But even disinterested individuals wind up asking, ``Do we care?''_and they reach that point with
remarkable consistency.

We should care. The integrity of a banking system is a national treasure. Careless distribution of the value of converting
institutions undermines that integrity. A form of transaction in part designed to avoid the value-distribution
question_though it worked well for a while_today forces well-meaning bankers and lawyers and trustees and regulators
to wink at polite fictions. Many have suggested that this is hardly a crime, since there is no victim. We disagree. Honor
is the victim.

Life is full of compromises. There is no ``right'' answer to the value-distribution question. But there is a right
process for addressing it. We invite broad participation in fashioning a compromise, as only democracy can, with
which no one is entirely satisfied, but in which all can take pride.



Questions on Which Comment Is Sought



The FDIC is hereby requesting comment during a 60-day comment period on all aspects of this notice, including the following
specific issues:

<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00058 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00032 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(1) Should a mutual institution be required, as a threshold issue, to demonstrate a need to convert_or is it sufficient
that it provide an adequate business plan for the future?

(2) In the absence of legislation, could and should the FDIC adopt guidelines or set standards for the distribution
of the existing value of a converting institution, or could or should the matter be left entirely to the trustees?

(3) Whether it is legislation or the FDIC or the board of trustees that sets standards, what should they be? Who should
get some of the value, how much, and how specific should the rules be?

(4) If depositors (or creditors or borrowers or employees) are to receive some of the value, how should it be allocated
among them? Should amount of deposit or tenure of association be accorded more weight? Must depositors and debtholders
be treated identically? What practical constraints exist, based on mutuals' information systems and resources?
What should the record date be?

(5) If charitable organizations or foundations are to receive a portion of the value, how should the suitability of
the recipients be determined? Should there be a presumption that the trustees' selection of recipients is reasonable?
Do there need to be rules to prevent abuse of such entities_

e.g.

, through ``consulting contracts'' with trustees? Should such entities be required to sell at the time of conversion,
or should they be permitted to diversify over time, in accordance with existing federal tax and banking laws?

(6) Does ``pressure to convert'' from parties who would receive value if an institution did so represent a legitimate
public policy concern? How great might that pressure be? How can trustees of institutions which have not elected to
convert be protected from unreasonable litigation?

(7) What potential problems (including tax issues and insider abuses) are there with the proposed new form of transaction,
and how can they be avoided or alleviated? On the assumption that the market will gradually improve on any form of transaction,
how specific does legislation or regulation need to be in that area?

(8) Should converting institutions (including those doing merger conversions) be required or encouraged to obtain
``fairness opinions'' from independent financial advisors? Should the FDIC attempt to ``police'' the market judgements
involved in the process in any way?

(9) Should new mutual holding company creations be permitted? If not, how should existing ones be regulated?




By the order of the Board of Directors.

<DOCTITLE>Banco Bilbao; Acquisition of Company Engaged in Permissible Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, S.A., Bilbao, Spain (Applicant), a foreign banking organization subject to the Bank Holding
Company Act (BHC Act), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act and  225.23(a)(2) and (3) of the Board's
Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(2) and (3)), to retain an interest in its indirect subsidiary, Probursa International
Incorporated, New York, New York (Company), and thereby engage in the following securities-related activities:

(1) providing investment advisory services pursuant to  225.25(b)(4) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.25(b)(4));
(2) providing full service brokerage services pursuant to  225.25(b)(4) and (b)(15) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.25(b)(4)
and (b)(15)), including exercising investment discretion on behalf of institutional customers;
(3) buying and selling, on the order of customers, all types of securities as a riskless principal; and
(4) engaging in the private placement of all types of securities as agent.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
``which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.'' This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, ``closely related to banking.'' Second, the Board must find in a particular
case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may be reasonably be expected to produce
public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
The Board previously has determined by regulation that the proposed investment advisory and full-service brokerage
activities are closely related to banking under section 4 of the BHC Act. 

See

 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4) and (b)(15). Applicant has committed that it will conduct these activities in accordance with
the Board's limitations and restrictions on the conduct of such activities. The Board also has previously determined
that the proposed riskless principal and private placement activities are closely related to banking, subject to
certain prudential limitations on the conduct of such activities which address the potential for conflicts of interest,
unsound banking practices, and other adverse effects. 

See, e.g., J.P. Morgan & Company Inc.

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 26 (1990); 

Bankers Trust New York Corporation

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 829 (1989). Applicant has committed to conduct the proposed riskless principal and
private placement activities subject to the conditions and limitations contained in these and other Board orders
approving these activities.
In order to satisfy the proper incident to banking test, section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act requires the Board to find that
the performance of the activities by Company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as
greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency that outweigh possible adverse effects, such
as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking
practices. Applicant believes that the proposed activities will benefit the public by promoting competition and
by providing a wider range of services and added convenience to Company's customers. Thus, Applicant believes that
the proposed activities will result in benefits to the public that would outweigh any adverse effects associated
with the proposal.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any views or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than July 6, 1994. Any request for hearing
on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal. 
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

<DOCTITLE>National Institutes of Health; Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations of Authority</DOCTITLE>



Part H, Chapter HN (National Institutes of Health) of the Statement of Organization, Functions, and Delegations
of Authority for the Department of Health and Human Services (40 FR 22859, May 27, 1975, as amended most recently at
59 FR 25952-25953, May 18, 1994) is amended to reflect the reorganization of the nutrition research coordination
function within the NIH. The reorganization consists of (1) transferring the functions of the Division of Nutrition
Research Coordination (DNRC) from the Office of Disease Prevention (ODP), Office of the Director, NIH (OD/NIH),
to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK); (2) abolishing the DNRC within the
ODP, OD/NIH; and (3) establishing the Division of Nutrition Research within the NIDDK. The transfer of the nutrition
coordination function is consistent with Title VI of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103-43) which
reiterates the lead role of the NIDDK in nutrition and obesity research and mandates an expanded NIDDK role in the coordination
of trans-NIH nutrition research and translation efforts.

Section HN-B, Organization and Functions, is amended as follows: (1) Under the heading 

Office of the Director (HNA), Office of Disease Prevention (HNA2), 

delete the title and functional statement of the 

Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (HNA24) 

in their entirety.

(2) Under the heading 

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (HNK), 

insert the following after the heading 

Division of Extramural Activities (HNK7):

Division of Nutrition Research Coordination (HNK8). 

(1) Through the NIDDK Director, advises the NIH Director and others on nutrition research issues; (2) coordinates
the nutrition research and training activities of the research institutes; (3) works with the NIH organizational
components to coordinate the development of RFAs, PAs, and RFPs to enhance the nutritional research activities of
the NIH; (4) coordinates the NIH contribution to the Departmental Research Initiative in Nutrition that includes
developing the 5-year Plan on Nutrition and Training, and the NIH Program in Biomedical and Behavioral Nutrition
Research and Training; (4) inputs and maintains all Federal (NIH, FDA, DOD, etc.) nutrition research into the Human
Nutrition Research and Information Management System; (6) represents the NIH and provides liaison at the DHHS and
interagency level on various committees on nutrition research and policy issues such as the Interagency Committee
on Human Nutrition Research and Nutrition Policy Board; (7) prepares the 

Annual Report of the NIH Program in Biomedical and Behavioral Nutrition Research and Training; 

and (8) develops and maintains effective liaison with other departments and agencies that have nutrition mechanisms.

ACTION:

 Notice of public meeting. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, this notice announces a meeting of the 1994 Advisory Council
on Social Security (the Council). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
1. Purpose 


Under section 706 of the Social Security Act (the Act), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary)
appoints the Council every 4 years. The Council examines issues affecting the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors,
and Disability Insurance (OASDI) programs, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which were created under
the Act. 
In addition, the Secretary has asked the Council specifically to address the following: 
 Social Security financing issues, including developing recommendations for improving the long-range financial
status of the OASDI programs; 
 General program issues such as the relative equity and adequacy of Social Security benefits for persons at
various income levels, in various family situations, and various age cohorts, taking into account such factors as
the increased labor force participation of women, lower marriage rates, increased likelihood of divorce, and higher
poverty rates of aged women. 
In addressing these topics, the Secretary suggested that the Council may wish to analyze the relative roles of the
public and private sectors in providing retirement income, how policies in both sectors affect retirement decisions
and the economic status of the elderly, and how the disability insurance program provisions and the availability
of health insurance and health care costs affect such matters. 
The Council is composed of 12 members in addition to the chairman: Robert Ball, Joan Bok, Ann Combs, Edith Fierst, Gloria
Johnson, Thomas Jones, George Kourpias, Sylvester Schieber, Gerald Shea, Marc Twinney, Fidel Vargas, and Carolyn
Weaver. The chairman is Edward Gramlich. 
The Council is to report to the Secretary, and such reports shall thereupon be transmitted to the Congress and to the
Board of Trustees of each of the Trust Funds. 


II. Agenda 


The Council will discuss: 
 Economic well-being of today's elderly and those soon to retire; 
 Prognoses for baby-boom cohorts and beyond; 
 Issues facing the Social Security program; 
 Issues concerning pensions and other retirement saving; and 
 Matters relating to technical panels of experts. 
The agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. 
The meeting is open to the public to the extent that space is available, beginning at 1:00 p.m. on June 24, 1994. That
day's morning session will deal only with internal personnel and administrative matters of the Council not relating
to the substantive purpose of the meeting. Therefore, under the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2)),
that session is exempt from being open to the public. Interpreter services for persons with hearing impairments will

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Office of the Secretary</USBUREAU>






Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of interim ADR policy and opportunity for comment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of the Interior (Department) has developed this two-year interim policy to implement the requirements
of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADR Act), Public Law No. 101-552. This interim policy also addresses
the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, Public Law No. 101-648. The Department is adopting this interim policy to allow
time to acquire data on the applicability of ADR techniques to selected program disputes. During this interim period,
the Department through its bureaus and offices will implement ADR pilot programs and other program initiatives in
an effort to establish a baseline of experience in the practical uses of ADR. At the conclusion of this interim phase,
the Department will assess the results of the ADR initiatives in conjunction with both external and internal comments
received, develop a proposed final policy, allow for public comment, and publish a final ADR policy in the 

Federal Register

.




The Department seeks comments from the public, including, among others, those persons whose activities the Department
regulates, on any aspect of this interim policy and its implementation, and those persons who have engaged in or may
in the future engage in ADR processes with the Department. At the end of the 60 day comment period the Department will
consider issues raised by interested persons and may modify the interim policy based on public comment.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Administrative Dispute Resolution Act

 

The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADR Act), Public Law No. 101-552, 5 U.S.C. 581-583, enacted
November 15, 1990, authorizes and encourages federal agencies to employ consensual methods of dispute resolution
as alternatives to litigation. Under the ADR Act, a federal agency is required: (1) To designate a senior official
as a dispute resolution specialist; (2) to establish training programs in the use of dispute resolution methods;
(3) to adopt a policy on the use of ADR techniques; and (4) to review the standard language in agency contracts, grants
or other agreements, to determine whether to include a provision on ADR. Federal agencies are also required to consult
with the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service
(FMCS) on the development of their ADR policies.

Additionally, section 3(a) of the ADA Act requires the Department to adopt a formal policy as to how it intends to implement
the ADR Act in each of the following areas: (a) Formal and informal adjudications; (b) rulemakings; (c) enforcement
actions; (d) issuing and revoking licenses or permits; (e) contract administration; (f) litigation brought by or
against the Department; and (g) other departmental action.

Congress enacted the ADR Act to reduce the time, cost, inefficiencies and contentiousness that are too often associated
with litigation and other adversarial dispute mechanisms. Moreover, experience at other federal agencies shows
that ADR can help achieve mutually acceptable solutions to disputes more effectively than either litigation or administrative
adjudication. In fact, Vice President Gore recommended in September 1993 that federal agencies ``increase the use
of alternative means of dispute resolution.'' National Performance Review, Recommendation REG06 (September 7,
1993).

<TEXT>
 

While ADR techniques have proven to be useful in resolving serious conflicts, the day-to-day operations of the Department's
bureaus should provide conflict avoidance methods, where possible. Moreover, the ADR Act, 5 U.S.C. 582(b), specifically
cautions that:

An agency shall consider not using a dispute resolution proceeding if_




(1) a definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and such a proceeding
is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent;

(2) the matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures
before a final resolution may be made, and such a proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy
for the agency;

(3) maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are
not increased and such a proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions;

(4) the matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;

(5) a full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide such a
record; and

(6) the agency must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the
matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the agency's
fulfilling that requirement.




The decision whether to use ADR, however, remains within each federal agency's discretion, and participation in
ADR processes is by mutual consent of the disputants.

The ADR Act fosters the use of ADR by ensuring appropriate protection of parties' and neutrals' communication. The
ADR Act, however, is not a statute exempting disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). To establish
a baseline of understanding, concerned parties should establish confidentiality guidelines consistent with FOIA
requirements before entering into negotiations.

Within the limitations set forth in the ADR Act, and elsewhere, the Department plans to explore, over the next two years,
whether and in which contexts the use of ADR facilitates fairer, faster, or more rational resolutions of disputes
than present dispute resolution methods provide. Additionally, the Department will conduct an evaluation of the
interim policy. On the basis of this evaluation, the Department will consider modifying any of its current procedures
or rules, as appropriate, to allow for greater use of ADR.



II. Negotiated Rulemaking Act



In enacting the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, Public Law No. 101-648, Congress indicated its concern that traditional
notice and comment rulemaking procedures may discourage agreement among the potentially affected parties and the
Federal Government. Congress addressed this concern by purposefully designing the Negotiated Rulemaking Act's
procedures to facilitate the cooperative development of regulations by interested persons and agencies. Moreover,
Vice President Gore's report recently recommended improving agencies' regulatory systems by ``[e]ncourag[ing]
agencies to use negotiated rulemaking more frequently in developing new rules.'' National Performance Review,
Recommendation REG03.

Negotiated Rulemaking (Reg-Neg) does not replace the traditional notice and comment rulemaking. Rather, Reg-Neg
supplements the more traditional process by developing consensus around the candidate proposed rule before an agency
publishes it in the 

Federal Register.

 Combining early consensus-building and information-gathering with an opportunity for broad public consideration,
the Reg-Neg process meets the prescription of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 

et seq.

, and can facilitate more effective regulatory development and regulations. Moreover, on September 30, 1993, President
Clinton issued a Memorandum in conjunction with the issuance of Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and
Review. The Memorandum required each department to identify to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
at least one rulemaking within the upcoming year to be developed through negotiated rulemaking or to explain why negotiated
rulemaking would not be feasible, 58 FR 52391 (Oct. 7, 1993).

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00072 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Decisionmakers should view Reg-Neg as one of a variety of information-gathering and consensus-building or consultative
processes used to achieve effective, efficient, rational, and fair agency policy. Although the Negotiated Rulemaking
Act does not address less formal decisionmaking processes, including, among others, policy roundtables and public
meetings, such nonadversarial processes may help gather information to assist the Department in policy development.
Participation in informal regulatory development processes can require significant commitment of resources on
the part of all participants, including federal agencies. The Department's experience, however, has shown that
consensus-building techniques can result in better policy, reduce the high rate of litigation, and lower the costs
of program implementation for the Department's bureaus and the regulated community.


III. Interim Policy


A. Application of the Interim Policy


The Department encourages the effective use of ADR and Reg-Neg to the fullest extent compatible with existing law,
and the Department's resources and missions. Based on almost one hundred and fifty years of experience, the Department
recognizes that the use of consensus-building techniques and nonadversarial planning processes can increase the
wisdom, efficiency, equity, and long-term stability of departmental decisions.
The interim policy is intended to govern both the programmatic side of the Department's broad responsibility, as
well as many of the human resources aspects. With regard to human resources, this interim ADR policy embraces the ADR
policy of the Department's Office for Equal Opportunity. The use of ADR is expected to be very useful in matters involving
equal employment opportunity. Workplace dispute issues outside the jurisdiction of actions governed by regulations
issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board will also be governed by this policy. Where the use of ADR would impede
effective supervisory action in routine matters of employee discipline or performance appraisal, supervisors
may elect not to use ADR.


B. Purpose of the Interim Policy


The Department has developed a two-year ADR interim policy in response to the requirements of the ADR Act. The policy
encourages the Department's bureaus to identify disputes amenable to ADR and to use ADR, whenever practicable. After
testing ADR methods in a variety of contexts, the Department, through the Interior Dispute Resolution Council, at
the conclusion of the two-year interim phase, will assess the appropriateness of the use of ADR and determine which
program areas could most benefit from the institutionalization of ADR processes. Existing bureau ADR efforts should
continue as this final policy is developed.
The Department's interim ADR policy is also designed to disseminate knowledge about ADR both within the Department
and to those whom the Department serves, as well as to introduce new ADR initiatives and to provide guidelines for bureaus
to apply in the implementation of ADR pilot programs. These initiatives will produce a baseline of experience that
will be used in developing the Department's final ADR policy. Without the full commitment and cooperation of all involved
in the two-year interim phase, the Department will lose a valuable opportunity to learn what works, what does not,
and how best to capture potential benefits from ADR use.


C. Implementation of Interim Policy


1. Role of the Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist


Pursuant to the ADR Act, the Secretary appointed the Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) to serve as the
Department's Dispute Resolution Specialist (DRS). This high level, Department official was appointed as the DRS
in order: (1) To facilitate intra-departmental coordination and communication; (2) to ensure consistent, quality
training; (3) to establish minimum qualifications for mediators, arbitrators, and certain departmental employees
with ADR responsibilities; and (4) to reduce administrative redundancy. The DRS will maintain an ``open door'' policy,
welcoming inquiries from and offering assistance to the bureaus and interested persons. During the period that the
interim policy is being implemented, ongoing input from the public is encouraged. The DRS will also develop and make
available a roster of neutrals who are trained in ADR and who would be available to participate in a dispute resolution
proceeding. Despite this focal point for ADR activity, the Department's interim ADR policy is to encourage decentralized
decisionmaking to the greatest extent possible.


2. Role of the Interior Department Resolution Council


In order to keep the Department's bureaus informed during the implementation of the interim phase, the DRS shall,
30 days after publication of the Department interim policy, convene the Interior Dispute Resolution Council (IDRC).
Composed of the Department's Assistant Secretaries, Solicitor and the Director of the Office of Regulatory Affairs
(ORA), or their respective designees, and chaired by the DRS, the IDRC shall monitor and evaluated the Department's
use of ADR and Reg-Neg and assist in intradepartmental policy and process coordination. The IDRC shall act as an information
clearinghouse, recommend personnel training courses in ADR techniques and program design, and act as the liaison
between the ACUS and FMCS.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, the IDRC will consider the benefits of appointing a departmental ombudsman and the benefits of appointing
an ombudsman for selected departmental bureaus. An ombudsman could serve the following functions: (1) To address
specific categories of workplace disputes through the investigation of the circumstances giving rise to the disputes
and based on their findings to recommend corrective actions, if appropriate; or (2) to investigate and propose the
resolution, if appropriate, of citizen complaints against the Department, including recommendations for changes
in agency structure or organization to better address or avoid persistent problems. The IDRC will submit a written
report at the end of the Interim period on the use of an ombudsman.






3. Training in ADR





The Department recognizes, consistent with the philosophy of the National Performance Review, that bureaus can
best evaluate and develop specific ADR programs and initiatives to meet bureau needs. Therefore, each Bureau Head
shall appoint a Bureau Dispute Resolution Specialist (BDRS). The BDRS shall receive training recommended by the
DRS in ADR consensus-building techniques, conflict resolution, and program design.






The DRS shall recommend appropriate BDRS training, such training to be completed no later than 60 days following issuance
of the interim policy. Additionally, the DRS shall provide ADR training opportunities for selected groups of senior
managers of the Department, whose job responsibilities include determining or influencing how disputes will be
managed. The DRS will also identify opportunities for advanced training in facilitation and mediation for judges
and attorneys within OHA, as appropriate.



4. Development of Bureau Alternative Dispute Resolution Plans





The BDRS shall develop and submit the Bureau's Alternate Dispute Resolution Plan (ADRP) through the Bureau Head to
the appropriate Assistant Secretary no later than 60 days following the completion of training. The ADRP shall include
at least one category of disputes amenable to ADR methods, and a discussion of how the bureau will implement ADR to address
such disputes. Additionally, to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the bureau's initiative(s), the ADRP
should address, among other topics, the (1) Goals; (2) objectives; (3) timetable; (4) implementation strategy;
(5) monitoring criteria; and (6) evaluation methodology. It is permissible if two or more bureaus adopt the same plan
or parts of a plan.


In selecting appropriate ADR pilot initiatives, a bureau can focus, for example, on a particular category of dispute
(e.g., contract cases), on a variety of disputes involving a particular organizational segment or region of the agency,
or on a particular ADR process that would be applied in a variety of disputes across the bureau. In selecting a focus
for an ADR pilot initiative, the Department encourages bureaus to consider using some of the disputes that are central
to the Department's mission. While a bureau should not avoid identifying personnel and small contract disputes,
for example, as candidates for a pilot initiative, a bureau should not focus exclusively on these areas so that the
effectiveness of ADR for a bureau can be judged in a programmatic context.




Some offices of the Department, such as the Office of the Solicitor, assist bureaus in carrying out their programs
rather than conducting programs of their own. For the purposes of this policy, such offices should assist their client
bureaus in implementing ADR in a programmatic context. Nonetheless, such offices should develop an ADRP for internal,
human resource management purposes.



Consistent with the many activities and functions of the Department and the Federal Acquisition Regulations' (FAR)
recognition of the usefulness of ADR in government contracts, each BDRS, or appointed designees, should review categories
of all proposed new and renewal contracts, agreements, permits, memoranda of understanding, and other documents,
to determine whether to include ADR provisions. Moreover, the Department encourages the use of ADR in contract disputes
prior to these disputes reaching the Interior Board of Contract Appeals. To avoid duplication of effort by bureau
personnel, the Office of the Solicitor, working with the Department's Senior Procurement official, will develop
standardized ADR-related clauses that bureaus can use in contracts and other documents.




The Department expects, as well, that those bureaus with comparatively more dispute resolution experience will,
on a voluntary basis, assist bureaus less familiar with dispute resolution in the development of the ADRP. The Department
expects, as well, that inter-bureau initiatives such as ``one stop permitting,'' for example, be coordinated with
the BDRSs. Each BDRS and others involved with the implementation of the interim policy are encouraged to consult with
other federal agencies, and others in the dispute resolution field in the development of their ADR initiatives. The
DRS is available to provide the names of contact persons within various federal agencies who have effectively utilized
ADR methods in resolving disputes.




Judges within all boards and divisions of OHA will be encouraged to utilize, where appropriate, ADR methods, including,
among others, the use of settlement judges, minitrials, and the referral of litigants to mediation or arbitration
in advance of a judge's consideration of a case on the merits. OHA will develop an internal policy for the appointment
of settlement judges and will refer litigants to a list of approved mediators and arbitrators.

<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00074 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The appropriate Assistant Secretary or designee shall, upon receipt of a bureau's ADRP, review and approve the ADRP
in consultation with the IDRC. Within 30 days after approval of an ADRP, a bureau shall publish its ADRP in the 

Federal Register 

or otherwise make the ADRP accessible to interested persons. 



D. Monitoring and Evaluation 


Each BDRS shall monitor the implementation of his or her bureau's dispute resolution initiatives on an ongoing basis,
using the criteria developed in their ADRP. Each BDRS shall submit to the IDRC, through the proper Bureau Head and Assistant
Secretary, every 180 days, an evaluation of the bureau's progress toward meeting the goals, objectives, and timetables
on the basis of the methodology outlined in the ADRP. The evaluation should also discuss any unanticipated issues
that each bureau may have encountered and how those issues have been or are being resolved. 

The BDRSs in conjunction with the IDRC shall, at the conclusion of the two-year interim phase, catalogue and evaluate
the bureaus' respective initiatives and experiences under their ADRPs in a report to the Secretary. This evaluation,
coordinated by the DRS, as chair of the IDRC, will focus on the categories of dispute and types ADR methods that were
most helpful in achieving resolution of disputes. 

Moreover, because the usefulness of ADR to the Department is dependent on the processes' ability to facilitate rational,
fair, efficient, and stable solutions among the Department's bureaus, the regulated community and the public, evaluation
of the interim policy should receive the benefit of public public comment and participation. 

A concluding section of the evaluation should explain how dispute resolution will be integrated on a permanent basis
into each bureau's program offices. This process of review, evaluation, and modification will allow each bureau
to systematically and regularly improve its ADR programs. 



E. Development of Final ADR Policy 



The IDRC in conjunction with the BDRSs, and with the benefit of public comment and participation, will develop a permanent
Department ADR policy on the basis of the Department's two-year interim policy experience. The DRS will be responsible
for the coordination of the development of the Department's final policy, and shall ensure issuance of that policy
no later than 90 days after the conclusion of the interim policy. During the time between conclusion of the interim
policy and issuance of the final policy, the interim policy shall remain in effect, as appropriate. 



F. Negotiated Rulemaking 



Pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Presidential Memorandum on Negotiated Rulemaking, issued September 30,
1993, the Department will use, where appropriate, negotiated rulemaking or other consensus-building techniques
to develop rules that are fair, technically accurate, and clear. Each bureau will evaluate, prior to drafting or amending
any regulation, whether negotiated rulemaking is appropriate for developing or amending that regulation and will
explain, on the Regulatory Alert Form submitted to the ORA, the basis for determining whether or not the regulation
will be developed or amended using negotiated rulemaking. 

In explaining whether negotiated rulemaking should be used for a particular rulemaking, each bureau should address
at least the following: 

(1) Whether there exists a small and identifiable group of constituents (the ``parties'') with significant interests
in the rulemaking, so that all reasonably foreseeable significant interests can be represented by individuals in
the negotiation; 

(2) Whether the parties believe it to be in their best interest to enter into a negotiated rulemaking; 

(3) Whether the parties are willing and able to enter into negotiated rulemaking in good faith;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00075 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Whether any single party has, or is perceived to have, the ability to dominate negotiations, thereby making a compromise
solution unlikely; 

(5) Whether there are clear and identifiable issues that are agreed to be ripe for a negotiated solution; 

(6) Whether a negotiated solution would require one or more parties to compromise a fundamental value; 

(7) Whether the use of negotiated rulemaking is reasonably likely to result in an agreement or course of action satisfactory
to all parties; and 

(8) Whether there are legal deadlines or other legal issues that either mitigate against negotiation or provide incentives
to reach a negotiated solution. 

If a bureau has decided to enter into a negotiated rulemaking, it will prepare a brief report describing the goals,
objectives, anticipated parties, and projected timetables of the negotiation. Throughout the negotiation, the
bureau will prepare brief periodic reports discussing the progress toward achieving the goals, objectives, and
timetables of the negotiation, and highlighting any successes and unanticipated events or issues encountered during
the negotiation. These reports shall be submitted to ORA and the IDRC. 

At the end of the two-year interim policy, ORA, the DRS, and IDRC shall prepare a report to the Secretary evaluating
the Department's experiences with negotiated rulemaking. This report will focus upon the types of policies, categories
of rulemakings, and methods of negotiation that were most successful in achieving customer satisfaction and the
cost-effective implementation of mutually agreeable rulemakings. This report will be based upon evaluations conducted
by the bureaus and submitted to ORA, IDRC, and the DRS for review and assimilation into the report to the Secretary.

_Any oral or written communication prepared for the purposes of a dispute resolution proceeding, including any memoranda,
notes, or work product of the neutral, parties, or nonparty participants. A written agreement to enter into a dispute
resolution proceeding, or a final written agreement or arbitration award reached as a result of a dispute resolution
proceeding, is not a dispute resolution communication.



Dispute resolution proceeding

_Any process in which an alternative means of dispute resolution is used to resolve an issue in controversy in which
a neutral is appointed and specified parties participate.



Facilitation

_Involves the assistance of a third party who is impartial toward the issues under discussion and who works with all
participants in a whole group session providing procedural directions on how the group can effectively move through
the problem-solving steps of the meeting and arrive at the jointly agreed upon goal.



Fact-finding

_Involves the use of neutrals acceptable to all parties to determine disputed facts. This can be particularly useful
where disagreements about the need for or the meaning of data are impeding resolution of a dispute, or where the disputed
facts are highly technical and would be better resolved by experts. Fact-finding usually involves an informal presentation
of its case by each party. The neutral(s) then provide an advisory opinion on the disputed facts, which can be used by
the parties as a basis for further negotiation.



Litigation

_A dispute brought in a court of law to enforce a statute, right, or legally created cause of action that will be decided
based upon legal principles or evidence presented.



Mediation

_Involves the intervention into a dispute of an impartial and neutral third party, who has no decisionmaking authority
but who will procedurally assist the parties to reach voluntarily an acceptable settlement of issues in dispute.



Minitrial

_A structured settlement process in which the disputants agree on a procedure for presenting their cases in highly
abbreviated versions (usually no more than a few hours or a few days) to senior officials for each side with authority
to settle the dispute. This process allows those in senior positions to see firsthand the relative strengths and weaknesses
of their cases and can serve as a basis for more fruitful negotiations. Often, a neutral presides over the hearing,
and may, subsequently, mediate the dispute or help parties evaluate their cases.



Negotiated rulemaking

_Rulemaking accomplished through the use of a negotiated rulemaking committee.



Negotiated rulemaking committee

_An advisory committee established by an agency in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act and the Federal
Advisory Committee Act to consider and discuss issues for the purpose of reaching a consensus in the development of
a proposed rule.



Negotiation

_Involves a bargaining relationship between two or more parties who have either perceived or actual conflicts of
interest. The participants join voluntarily in a temporary relationship to educate each other about their needs
and interests and exchange specific resources or promises that will resolve on or more issues. Almost all of the ADR
procedures, in which the parties maintain control over the outcome of the conflict, are variations upon or elaborations
of the negotiation process.



Neutral

_An individual, who with respect to an issue in controversy, functions specifically to aid the parties in resolving
the controversy. The individual may be a permanent or temporary officer or employee of the Federal Government, or
any other individual who is acceptable to the parties to a dispute resolution proceeding. A neutral shall have no official,
financial, or personal conflict of interest with respect to the dispute, unless such interest is fully disclosed
in writing to all parties and all parties agree that the neutral may serve.



Ombudsman

_A person designated to address selected categories of disputes by investigating the circumstances that gave rise
to the matter; and based upon the investigative findings, recommending corrective action, as appropriate.



Roster

_A list of persons qualified to provide services as neutrals that is maintained by the agency.

Appendix II_Examples of ADR Initiatives 



Various bureaus and offices within the Department have been involved in implementing ADR processes. Some of the more
prominent examples of ADR initiatives that reflect the Department's commitment to ADR include: 

In 1990, the Department disseminated to each of the Department's bureaus and offices an ADR survey designed to identify
program areas that could be amenable to ADR techniques. Among the questions asked were: (1) The categories of disputes
in which the organization is typically involved; (2) the number of cases during the prior 2 fiscal years that were (a)
docketed, (b) settled, and (c) litigated, and the approximate cost involved; and (3) the organization's experience
to date in utilizing ADR techniques. 

The Department conducted an orientation program on ADR. Included in the orientation program was Senator Charles
Grassley, one of the sponsors of the ADR Act, together with representatives of the Administrative Conference of the
United States (ACUS) and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). 

The Department conducted a one day training program on ADR. The training focused on the various methods of ADR and included
representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health
and Human Services, and the Department of Transportation, each of whom shared their experiences in developing successful
ADR programs. 

The Department's Office for Equal Opportunity (OEO) provided training in basic and advanced mediation skills for
OEO and personnel program officials and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselors. OEO also issued a directive
to bureaus and offices providing guidance on the development and implementation of ADR pilot programs consistent
with 29 CFR part 1614. Under this directive each bureau and office is to submit an ADR pilot program plan delineating
specific actions to be taken to incorporate ADR techniques into the EEO complaints process. 

The Department recently made consideration of the use of ADR in the resolution of discrimination complaints mandatory
and has designated a Departmental EEO/ADR Coordinator and directed each bureau to designate a Bureau EEO/ADR Coordinator.


The Department designated the Bureau of Reclamation as a pilot bureau in FY-93 for the purpose of testing the
effectiveness of mediation in the resolution of EEO complaints and administrative grievances. The Bureau has relied
exclusively on contract neutrals to serve as mediators for all dispute referred for ADR. Mediation has also been utilized
by Reclamation in other program areas, including resource management and contract administration. Reclamation
is assessing the results of its mediation program to determine whether to expand its usage to other program areas.


The Department's Office of Hearings and Appeals has implemented ADR as an alternative to administrative litigation.
The Board of Indian Appeals and the administrative law judges vested with authority for adjudicating Indian probate
cases have encouraged the use of settlement agreements to resolve these matters. Under 43 CFR 4.207, administrative
law judges have been authorized to effect compromise settlements in probate actions where the parties concerned
agree to compromise and where the judge establishes that all necessary conditions have been met. The Board of Contract
Appeals has been effectively implementing ADR processes over the last 2 years in its cases. At the time a case is docketed,
the Board issues an order notifying the parties to the dispute of the availability and benefits of ADR. Through actively
promoting ADR as a viable alternative, the Board has settled a majority of its cases without the need to conduct a hearing.


The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques, and a presentation on the topic
was made at the Bureau's Solid Minerals Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in April 1993. The BLM, in partnership
with the Bowie State University's Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution, has provided basic Conflict Management
ADR training to Personnelists and EEO practitioners, as well as to key management officials. The BLM will continue
to work with the Center for ADR and other outside resources to provide training during Fiscal Year 1994. 

The Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a rich history of ADR. The MMS's examples include (1) a process targeted
at settling outstanding and contentious mineral royalty claims which has reduced appeals and litigation and increased
royalty collections, and (2) more than a decade of conflict resolution training for offshore minerals management
personnel and establishment and conduct of a joint review panel for constituent review of environmental documents.


The Bureau of Mines (USBM) has recognized the benefits of ADR techniques and has provided training to principal officials
in the use of ADR techniques. Training was provided by a contractor for the Directorates of the Bureau on orientation
to ADR techniques; Information and Analysis on September 28, 1993; Finance and Management, December 8, 1993; and
Research on January 11, 1994. Training will also be provided to EEO Counselors by the EEO Staff and the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service in June 1994. The Bureau plan to continue the use of ADR for EEO complaints and to expand it
to other types of disputes. The EEO Office has used mediation and negotiation for EEO complaints in the precomplaint
stage and also the formal complaint stage.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Rule G-37 on Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal
Securities Business, and Rule G-8 on Recordkeeping



June 3, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide procedures
for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G-37, in limited circumstances, and to clarify certain definitions
in rules G-37 and G-8. The Board has requested accelerated approval of the proposed rule change to facilitate
compliance with rule G-37. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the propose rule
change from interested persons. As discussed below, the Commission finds good cause for granting accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing the proposed rule change to amend rule G-37 concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business, and rule G-8 concerning recordkeeping. The proposed rule change: (i) Provides
procedures for dealers to seek exemptive relief from rule G-37's prohibition on business, in limited circumstances;
and (ii) clarifies certain definitions in rules G-37 and G-8. The Board has requested accelerated approval
of the proposed rule change to facilitate compliance with the rule.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In response to the Board's initial proposal on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities
business and its rule G-37 filing with the Commission,
 the Board received a number of comments recommending that the Board consider providing, in limited instances, a ``good
faith exemption'' to the rule's prohibition on municipal securities business.
 In light of these comments, the Board has determined to submit the proposed rule change.





A registered securities association or appropriate regulatory agency may exempt a dealer who is prohibited from
engaging in municipal securities business with an issuer from such prohibition.




A number of commenters on rule G-37 have expressed concern that imposing a prohibition on municipal securities
business may be unfair in certain limited situations when political contributions have been made.
 For example, a disgruntled municipal finance professional may make a contribution purposely to injure the dealer,
its management or employees. Also, a municipal finance professional eligible to vote for an issuer official may make
a number of small contributions during an election cycle (

e.g.

, over four years) which, when consolidated, amount to slightly over the $250 

de minimis

 exemption (

e.g.

, $255). In both examples, the contributions would trigger the prohibition on business under rule G-37(b),
thereby prohibiting the dealer from engaging in municipal securities business with the issuer for two years.




The Board recognizes that in certain circumstances, such as those discussed above, the rule's prohibition on business
may be too harsh a consequence for truly inadvertent contributions or the contributions of disgruntled employees.
Thus, the Board has determined to add new paragraph (i) to rule G-37 to establish a procedure whereby the National
Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') and the federal bank regulatory agencies (

i.e.

, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation),
upon application by a dealer subject to such association's or agency's inspection and enforcement authority, may
exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, a dealer who is prohibited from engaging in municipal securities business
from such prohibition.
 In determining whether to grant such an exemption, the proposed rule change would require that the NASD and bank regulatory
agencies consider, among other factors, whether:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00089 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00055 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors and the purposes of this rule;
and
(ii) such dealer (A) prior to the time the contribution(s) which resulted in such prohibition was made, had developed
and instituted procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with this rule; (B) prior to or at the time the
contribution(s) which resulted in such prohibition was made, had no actual knowledge of the contribution(s); (C)
has taken all available steps to cause the person or persons involved in making the contribution(s) which resulted
in such prohibition to obtain a return of the contribution(s); and (D) has taken such other remedial or preventive
measures, as may be appropriate under the circumstances.



The Board believes that a dealer that is subject to the prohibition on business should have to make a substantial effort
to be exempted from that prohibition. The proposed rule change would require the dealer to petition the NASD or appropriate
bank regulatory agency to seek such an exemption and to provide sufficient evidence to justify an exemption. In making
a determination concerning an exemption, the NASD or appropriate bank regulatory agency would then review the facts
and circumstances presented by the dealer, as well as the factors set forth in the proposed rule change. The Board would
expect that this prohibition exemption not be routinely requested by dealers and that exemptions would be granted
by the NASD and the bank regulatory agencies only in limited circumstances. The Board believes that the proposed rule
change will offer relief from the prohibition on business in appropriate circumstances without sacrificing the
rule's purpose and intent, 

i.e., 

to ensure that the high standards and integrity of the municipal securities industry are maintained, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to perfect a free and open
market, and to protect investors and the public interest. The Board will seek information from the NASD and bank regulatory
agencies regarding the granting of any exemptions in order to monitor the implementation of this provision, and to
determine if any changes are necessary.


Definition of ``Official of an Issuer''


An ``official of an issuer'' is defined in rule G-37(g)(vi) as any incumbent, candidate or successful candidate
for elective office of the issuer, which office is directly or indirectly responsible for, or can influence the outcome
of, the hiring of a dealer for municipal securities business. The definition is intended to include any state or local
official or candidate (or successful candidate) who has influence over the awarding of municipal securities business,
including certain state-wide executive or legislative officials.
The Board, however, was concerned that because the definition focuses on ``an elective office of the issuer,'' it
did not clearly include certain other officials. For example, a state may have certain issuing authorities whose
boards of directors are appointed by the governor. Although the governor is an official with influence over the awarding
of municipal securities business, the governor, in this illustration, is not an incumbent or candidate for ``elective
office of the issuer'' (

i.e., 

the state authority). Thus, a contribution to the governor would not prohibit a dealer from engaging in business with
the state authority. The Board intended to include the governor as an official of the issuer in such circumstances
and, therefore, has determined to amend the definition to clarify its intent.
The amended definition of official of an issuer includes any incumbent or candidate ``for any elective office of a
state or of any political subdivision, which office has authority to appoint any official(s) of an issuer, as defined
in [paragraph (g)(vii)(A) of rule G-37].''

Definition of ``municipal securities business'' does not include competitive financial advisory activities.







The definition of ``municipal securities business'' in rule G-37(g)(vii) includes certain dealer activities,
such as acting as negotiated underwriters, financial advisors and consultants, placement agents, and negotiated
remarketing agents. In its rule G-37 filing with the Commission, the Board noted that the rule would not prohibit
dealers from acting as competitive underwriters or competitive remarketing agents.
 The Board is amending this definition to clarify that the rule also would not prohibit dealers from engaging in competitive
advisory activities.




Only associated persons come under definition of ``municipal finance professional.''







The Board determined to amend the definition of ``municipal finance professional,'' as set forth in rule G-37(g)(iv),
to clarify that only associated persons would fall within the rule's four categories of municipal finance professionals.





Dealers shall send G-37 Reports to the Board by certified or registered mail or by some other means that provides
a record of sending.





Rule G-37(e)(i) currently requires dealers to submit quarterly reports to the Board on Form G-37 concerning
political contributions and municipal securities business. The Board is concerned, however, that some confusion
could arise over whether particular reports were actually sent and/or lost in the mail. To obviate any such problem,
the Board is amending this paragraph to require that dealers send such reports to the Board ``by certified or registered
mail, or some other equally prompt means that provides a record of sending.'' This will ensure that dealers have a record
of all reports submitted to the Board.

The Board also is amending this paragraph to correct an erroneous cross-reference to rule G-8, which requires
dealers to submit to the Board reports on contributions that are required to be recorded pursuant to rule G-8(a)(xvi).







The rule requires, among other things, that dealers disclose the name, company, role and compensation arrangement
of any person, other than a municipal finance professional, employed by the dealer to obtain or retain business.






Paragraph (e)(ii) of rule G-37 requires that the reports referred to in paragraph (e)(i) include, among other
things, a list of issuers with which the dealer has engaged in municipal securities business, along with the type of
municipal securities business and the name, company, role, and compensation arrangement of any person employed
by the dealer to obtain or retain municipal securities business with such issuers. The Board intended that this provision
apply to persons such as outside consultants that are not municipal finance professionals associated with the dealer.
Thus, the amendment clarifies that this requirement does not require the dealer to disclose the name of such municipal
finance professionals.







Dealers complying with Commission Rule 17a-3 must maintain the information and records required by Board rule
G-37.








Board rule G-8(f) allows dealers, other than bank dealers, who are in compliance with Commission Rule 17a-3,
on recordkeeping, to be deemed in compliance with Board rule G-8, on recordkeeping. However, the rule provides
that specific information required by rule G-8 must be maintained, even though such information is not required
by Rule 17a-3. The Board is amending rule G-8(f) to clarify that dealers complying with Rule 17a-3
are still required to maintain the information and records required by Board rule G-37.






The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides
that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, since it will apply equally to brokers, dealers, and municipal securities
dealers.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The Board has requested that the Commission find good cause, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, for approving
the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication of the notice of filing in the 

Federal Register

. The Board believes that accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is necessary to facilitate dealer compliance
with rules G-37 and G-8.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00055 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to the Board, and, in particular, with Sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G) of the Act.
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section
15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities
dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved.




The Commission received several comments to rule G-37 recommending that the rule provide an exemption process,
based on the dealer's compliance procedures and supervision, for certain inadvertent violations.
 The Commission approved the rule and recommended the MSRB separately address these concerns by filing a proposed
rule change that provides an exemption process for inadvertent violations. The MSRB's proposal adequately addresses
these concerns.
 The proposal provides procedures for dealers to obtain exemptive relief from rule G-37's prohibition on business
where, for example, covered persons inadvertently make contributions that slightly exceed the 

de minimis 

exemption provided by the rule. The proposal's exemptive relief is based on the dealers' supervision of covered persons,
compliance procedures concerning rule G-37, and corrective and remedial action concerning inadvertent violations.
The Commission expects that dealers will apply for exemptive relief only in certain, limited situations. Thus, the
proposal provides an exemptive process to rule G-37 without providing dealers a ``loop-hole'' that would frustrate
the rule's purpose to, among other things, ensure that high standards and integrity of the municipal securities industry
are maintained.





The proposal also clarifies provisions of rules G-37 and G-8. Amendments to rule G-37's definitions
of ``official of an issuer,'' ``municipal securities business,'' and ``municipal finance professional,'' as well
as amendments to rules G-37 and G-8 disclosure and recordkeeping requirements will facilitate compliance
with the rules.
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing in the 

Federal Register

. Accelerated approval is necessary and appropriate to facilitate compliance with rules G-37 and G-8.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board Relating to Interpretation of Rule G-37 on Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal
Securities Business</DOCTITLE>



June 6, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 24, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide
interpretative guidance concerning rule G-37 on political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities
business. The Board, pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, filed the proposal as constituting a stated policy,
practice, or interpretation with respect to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the
Board. This renders the proposal effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission is publishing this notice
to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Board is filing the proposed rule change to provide interpretative guidance concerning rule G-37 on political
contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set
forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G-37, concerning political contributions and prohibitions
on municipal securities business.
 The Board has, and continues to receive, numerous inquiries concerning the application of the rule. In order to assist
the municipal securities industry and, in particular, brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers in understanding
and complying with the provisions of the rule, the Board has determined to publish this notice of interpretation which
provides, in question-and-answer format, general guidance on rule G-37. The Board will continue to monitor
the application of rule G-37, and, from time to time, will publish additional notices of interpretations, as
necessary.





The Board believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act, which provides
that the Board's rules shall be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just
and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,
settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



Because the proposed rule change would apply equally to all brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers, the
Board does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.

The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
rule 19b-4 thereunder because the rule change constitutes a stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect
to the meaning, administration, or enforcement of an existing rule of the Board. At any time within 60 days of the filing
of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such
action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the Board. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-MSRB-94-6 and should be submitted by July

detection. This document provides guidance to airport system designers, manufacturers, installers and user. The
cost of DO-221 is US$50.00 for U.S./Canada/Mexico and US$65.00 for all other countries, plus applicable shipping
and handling charges.

RTCA DO-222 

Guidelines on AMS(R)S Near-Term Voice Implementation and Utilization, 

contains operational guidelines and recommendations for the implementation and utilization of Aeronautical Mobile
Satellite (Route) Services, voice communication functions in the near-term (circa 1993-1996) air traffic
environment. It presents a system-level view of how satellite voice services can be implemented and used in the Air
Traffic Services (ATS) and Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC) environments inclusive of aircraft installation
requirements, ground infrastructure requirements and available AMS(R)S services. This document defines the functions
and performance needed to facilitate the development, implementation, certification and operational use of satellite
voice in an environment where satellite voice communication is not yet a required capability for air navigation.
It uses as its basis the existing standards for satellite avionics and ground equipment. It should be useful to designers,
manufacturers, installers and operators of equipment used in AMSS voice service. The cost of DO-222 is US$60.00

<DOCTITLE>Approval of Record of Decision (ROD) for a Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); Greater Rockford Airport,
Rockford, IL</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces that on June 3, 1994, it approved the Mitigated FONSI/ROD on
the proposed development at Greater Rockford Airport, Rockford, Illinois. Major development items, proposed to
be completed over the next 5 to 10 years, are depicted on the Airport Layout Plan (ALP).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FAA approved the Mitigated FONSI/ROD for proposed development at Greater Rockford Airport. Below is a listing
of major, associated and indirect development projects. This listing includes United Parcel Service's (UPS) recent
announcement to initiate a cargo hub facility at the airport.




1. Develop the midfield area for aviation-related industrial users.

2. Expand the existing cargo apron and buildings west of the existing terminal building to accommodate a minimum of
26 cargo aircraft.

3. Extend Runway 7/25 to a length of 10,000 feet by constructing a 3,500-foot southwesterly extension with parallel
and connecting taxiways and associated lighting and navigation aids. This would include the installation of a CAT
II Instrument Landing System (ILS) for Runway 7.

4. Relocate approximately 12,000 feet of Belt Line Road and 9,300 feet of Kishwaukee Road.

5. Expand the existing terminal building and auto parking lot and upgrade the existing airport entrance roadway.

6. Construct a general aviation apron and T-hangars.

7. Close Runway 13/31.

8. Remove miscellaneous support buildings.

9. Construct a new 4,000-foot general aviation visual approach runway, parallel to and 5,100 feet southeast of existing
Runway 7/25, with associated taxiways and instrumentation.

10. Construct and realign various taxiways parallel to Runway 1/19. The majority of the realignment work proposed
is adjacent to and west of the approach end of Runway 19.

11. Implement actions recommended in the 1993 Master Drainage/Stormwater Management Plan.

12. Implement actions recommended in the updated Noise Compatibility Plan.

13. Acquire approximately 1,100 acres of land for airfield development. In addition to this acquisition, is the relocation
of up to 28 residential dwellings (for noise and floodway mitigation), of which only eleven are considered to be noise
impacted and must be acquired and residents relocated prior to the start of any operation resulting from the Proposed
Action Alternative. The remaining residential dwellings would be acquired for purposes of airfield development
and floodway mitigation. Those dwellings identified as floodway mitigation can be acquired either in fee-simple
or through restrictive covenant. (Updated)

14. Compensate for wetland impacts caused by the development of the Proposed Action Alternative through the creation
of approximately 25 acres of new wetlands.

15. An additional 1,500 flights annually beyond those originally forecasted but with an greater number of stage three
aircraft. This is based on UPS's proposal to initiate an air cargo operation at Greater Rockford Airport.

The FAA issued a 

Federal Register

 Notice on April 22, 1993 announcing its intent to prepare an Environmental Document (possible Environmental Impact
Statement) and to hold a May 26, 1993 scoping meeting. At the scoping meeting no significant impacts were identified.
Some concerns were expressed over possible noise, floodplain and wetland impacts. The airport sponsor indicated
that any impacts would be mitigated below the level of significance as an integral part of the development.

The FAA issued a subsequent 

Federal Register

 Notice on February 17, 1994 announcing the availability of the Draft Environmental Document and provided additional
opportunity for scoping comments for the refined listing of the major, associated and indirect development projects,
incorporating items scoped originally and those newly identified as part of the UPS proposed development. Notice
was also given for a March 22, 1994 public hearing with written comments being received until April 6, 1994. Based on
the analysis found in the Final Environmental Assessment and the results of the public hearing, the FAA published
a May 2, 1994 

Federal Register

 Notice that it intended to issue a Mitigated FONSI/ROD for the proposed development depicted on the Airport Layout
Plan. The FAA received a letter from the Illinois Department of Agriculture (IDOA) stating their concerns with respect
to farmland impacts. The FAA addressed IDOA's concerns in a June 2, 1994 letter. On June 3, 1994, the FAA approved the
Record of Decision (ROD).

A copy of the Mitigated FONSI/ROD is available for review at the FAA-Chicago Airports District Office (address identified
above). Copies of these documents will also be available for review locally at locations which have not yet been determined.
These locations will be specified in a Public Notice or upon request of the Chicago Airports District Office (telephone
number identified above).

Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading, 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

On February 24, 1994, the Commissioner of Customs directed that Customs develop an Automated Export System (AES).
This system is being developed as a cooperative team effort involving Customs and the Bureau of the Census.

the purpose of: (1) Giving Customs managers an opportunity to provide the public with information related to the development
of AES and (2) giving attendees an opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide Customs with informal
ideas related to AES design and functionality. Each meeting will open with a short presentation on AES, past, present
and future, and after this presentation the floor will be open to all attendees for general informal discussion of
the AES program.

The first meeting will be held in Washington, D.C. on Friday, July 8, 1994, commencing at 9:00 a.m. in Hearing Room B
of the Interstate Commerce Commission Building. In order to ensure that overcrowding does not result, persons planning

NOFA for Vacancy Reduction Program 

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of funding availability. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of funding for activities under the Vacancy Reduction Program. Under this program,
certain public housing agencies (PHAs) are required to develop and submit a plan regarding vacancies in units owned
or operated by the PHA. Assessment teams have conducted on-site assessments of the vacancy situation at known eligible
PHAs, and when notified will conduct an assessment at any PHA that meets the eligibility requirements but has not been
assessed. In addition, when requested, HUD will provide assistance to any eligible PHA in developing its vacancy
reduction plan. Although funds available under this NOFA will be used to implement the plans, these funds are intended
to supplement other initiatives of the PHA that will reduce the rate of vacancies in a PHA's inventory. The NOFA contains
information on the following: 




(a) The purpose of the NOFA, available amounts, and eligibility; and 


(b) Application processing, including how to apply, the required content of the application, and how selections
will be made. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2577-0181. 



I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



A. Authority 




The funding made available under this Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) is authorized as a set-aside by section
115(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992
Act). Section 115(a) requires a percentage of the amounts available under section 14 of the United States Housing
Act of 1937 in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 to be set aside for the Vacancy Reduction Program. Final implementing regulations
for the Vacancy Reduction Program are published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1993 (Pub. L. 102-389, approved October 6, 1992; 106 Stat. 1582) (1993 Appropriations Act), Congress appropriated
$3.1 billion for activities under section 14, and in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development,
and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124, approved October 28, 1993 (1994 Appropriations
Act), Congress appropriated $3.23 billion for these activities. A total of $202,560,000 in set-asides is available
for this program to fund Vacancy Reduction Program activities. 




B. Allocation Amounts 




A portion of the funds available for this program will be used for travel and administrative expenses of the assessment
teams, as authorized by Section 115 of the 1992 Act. Of the remaining amount, no PHA applying for funding under this
NOFA may receive more than 15 percent of the total available funds. 

Subject to this 15 percent limitation, eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) that are Comprehensive Improvement
Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies will be provided funding in the full amounts approved for Vacancy Reduction Program
activities. For PHAs that are Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) agencies, if insufficient funds remain to fund all
eligible and approved activities under this NOFA, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be its pro rata
share of the total remaining funds available, in accordance with Section I.J(3) of this NOFA. 

All units that are funded in whole or in part by the Vacancy Reduction Program must be brought into compliance with the
Housing Quality Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, and must be readily marketable when the work is completed.




C. Background 



In order to gain greater insight into the vacancy problems of the PHAs required to participate in the Vacancy Reduction
Program, the Department sent a survey form on April 2, 1993, to all PHAs that, based on HUD data bases, were troubled
or mod-troubled on January 1, 1993, or had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on that date. Of the 400 identified PHAs,
345 responded to the survey. These PHAs reported a total of 56,324 vacancies, about half of the total vacancies nationally.
The responses showed that additional funding was necessary to cure only half of the vacancies in the inventories of
the responding PHAs. 

Of those vacant units whose occupancy was not dependent upon additional funding, the reasons for and percentages
of the total vacancies were as follows: 

 Ready, awaiting leasing_5.7%; 

 No demand (defined as few or no persons on the waiting list)_3.5%; 

 Undesirable (defined as requiring 4 or more offers to obtain a tenant, but not requiring funding)_2.0%; 

 Funded under a modernization program_29.7%; 

 In litigation_6.5%; and 

 Other reason not requiring funding_3.2%. 

Of those units in which vacancies could be eliminated with additional funding, the reasons for and percentages of
the vacancies were as follows: 

 Awaiting demolition_5.4%; 

 Needing modernization_30.0%; 

 Needing repair_12.8%; and 

 Other reason requiring funding_1.1%. 

Of the vacant units that would benefit from additional funding, the estimated costs of rehabilitation (exclusive
of any costs for lead-based paint testing and abatement) and percentage of total vacancies were as follows: 

 Up to $5,000_4.8%; 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00119 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00076 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 $5,000-10,000_14.8%; 
 $10,000-25,000_7.1%; and

 Over $25,000_13.8%.

Thus, almost 20% of all vacancies in these high-vacancy PHAs could be remedied for a cost of $10,000 or less per unit,
plus the cost of any lead-based paint activity, essential management improvements, Section 504 (of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973) rehabilitation, or other essential costs.

The Department seeks maximum efficiency in the use of Vacancy Reduction Program funds. To this end, the Department
met with public housing interest groups and resident representatives on January 28 and July 9, 1993, to discuss the
needs of public housing that might be met by this program. As a result, the Department has decided to focus this NOFA
on units that can be rehabilitated for occupancy at a modest cost, and on units with more expensive rehabilitation
costs where the PHA has the ability and agrees to provide the remainder of the funding necessary to prepare the property
for occupancy. In this way, the Department hopes to house the optimal number of additional families using the available
program funds.

The survey has enabled the Department to proceed with vacancy assessments (see 24 CFR 968.410 in the final rule published
elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

 and the preamble of the proposed rule, published at 58 FR 29728) for those PHAs that responded to the survey and indicated
an inventory of unfunded vacant units. Other PHAs that did not receive a survey form or did not respond to the survey,
but that believe they are eligible under this NOFA and wish to apply for funding, must notify the Department so that
an assessment can be scheduled as indicated under 

DATES,

 at the beginning of this NOFA.

The Vacancy Reduction Program is not designed to focus solely on the rehabilitation of vacant units; the program also
is intended to identify and correct site and management deficiencies as necessary to achieve and sustain occupancy
of vacant units. Management problems in some of the high-vacancy PHAs also may be responsible for vacancies. These
problems may include high turnover, poor maintenance and security, delays in making units ready for occupancy after
they are vacated, delays in placing tenants in units as soon as they are ready, or inability to deal with marketability
problems that could be addressed successfully. Therefore, management improvements that are necessary for a PHA
to achieve and maintain a high level of occupancy and to manage turnover successfully also will be funded under this
NOFA. The vacancy assessments will assist the PHAs and HUD in identifying what actions need to be taken in this regard.

Some PHAs may have difficulty preparing an application, including a vacancy reduction plan. The Department will,
on request by the PHA, assist the PHA in preparation of the plan. Such assistance may be requested by telephoning Strategic
Resources, Inc. (703) 749-3040. Moreover, if an application submitted in response to this NOFA is technically
approvable under the NOFA, but is deemed by HUD to need improvement or supplementation in specific areas of the PHA's
plan to increase the potential for success, HUD will require changes in the plan before execution of the amendment
of the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).



D. Definitions



The following definitions apply to this NOFA, in addition to the definitions that apply generally to the program under
 968.405 of the final rule published elsewhere in today's 

Federal Register

:



Assistant Secretary

 means the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.



Eligible unit 

means a dwelling unit that satisfies the conditions under either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this definition,
as applicable. The unit must be either:

(1) A 

vacant unit

 that meets the characteristics of both of the following paragraphs (1) (a) and (b): 
(a) The cost of rehabilitation necessary to make the unit available for occupancy and marketable (including development-wide
physical improvements and other necessary costs, but not including costs of lead-based paint activity, costs for
accessibility for those with disabilities, and management improvement funding) is either:

(i) $8,000 or less, when averaged with other vacant units in the development for which the PHA is applying for this category
of funding (i.e., average of not more than $8,000 per unit); or

(ii) More than $8,000, when averaged with other vacant units in the development for which the PHA is applying for this
category of funding (i.e., average of more than $8,000 per unit), and the PHA has available funding that it agrees to
use to pay the costs in excess of $8,000 per unit. ``Available funding'' includes funds legally available to the PHA
by September 30, 1994; and

(b) The unit will be marketable when it has been made ready for occupancy. Units that cannot be made marketable, for
any reason, are not eligible to be funded under this NOFA, and funds should not be requested for them in the application.
Such units, however, must be included in the vacancy reduction plan; or

(2) An 

occupied unit, 

if either:

(a) The unit meets the criteria of paragraphs (1)(a)(i) or (ii) and paragraph (1)(b) of this definition, and either:

(i) In order to address the overall vacancy situation at a PHA, it is necessary to move a resident family to another unit.
The unit vacated by that family may then be considered an eligible unit. For example, if a PHA has vacant one-bedroom
units for which there is no demand, but also has overhoused families that could be transferred to the one-bedroom units
(thus freeing up larger units for which there is a demand), the PHA could request funding under this NOFA for both units;
or

(ii) The unit is expected to be vacated under the Moving to Opportunities Program; or

<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00076 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) The PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, and the PHA had expended
funds on rehabilitation of the unit in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction Program
funds. The PHA may be reimbursed for the cost of the rehabilitation only if funds remain available after HUD has funded
all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds. 



Lead-based paint activity

 includes lead-based paint risk assessments, risk management (interim containment), testing, and abatement, consistent
with the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4826) and HUD implementing regulations
at 24 CFR parts 35, 965, and 968. 



Marketable

 means that there is a waiting list for units of the applicable size and that either the past experience of the PHA would
indicate that the unit should lease reasonably quickly after completion of the work funded under this program, or
other available data indicates that physical and management improvements, including more extensive outreach,
would likely result in a demand for the units. 



Repair

 includes routine maintenance when essential to the reoccupancy of the eligible vacant units. 



Vacancy Reduction Plan

 means a plan developed by the PHA that includes the following: 

(1) The statements required by  968.407(b) of the final rule (also see Appendix to this NOFA) published elsewhere
in today's 

Federal Register

; 

(2) For all vacant units, reported by development, information on the: 

(i) Number and percentage of units vacant at the time of application under this NOFA; 

(ii) Number and percentage of units expected to be occupied by each semiannual date after the submission of the PHA's
vacancy reduction plan, as provided under paragraph (3) of this definition, including date of full occupancy; 

(iii) Source of funding and expected percentage of funds to be obligated and expended by each semiannual date, as provided
under paragraph (3) of this definition; and 

(iv) Expected date of any demolition or disposition, and the number of units involved in this activity. 

(3) A schedule, by chart or time line, indicating milestones for vacancy reduction activities (all vacant units must
be included regardless of whether they require funding and whether they have already been funded). The schedule shall
indicate all actions that will have been taken as of the end of each semiannual period, either September 30 or March
31. 

(i) Actual calendar dates shall be used for units that do not require vacancy reduction program funding, but will be
funded from sources within the control of the PHA (e.g., CGP and the operating budget) or have already been funded by
another governmental program (e.g., CIAP, the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program). 

(ii) For units for which specific calendar dates cannot be given because approval from HUD is a prerequisite to the
action, the schedule shall specify semiannual dates from the expected HUD approval (e.g., first semiannual reporting
date after approval, second semiannual reporting date after approval, etc.). Such units include those for which
the PHA is requesting or intends to request funding under the Vacancy Reduction Program or another HUD program (e.g.,
CIAP or the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program), or for which approval of demolition/disposition is required
but has not yet been granted. 



E. PHA Eligibility 



(1) Indian Housing Authorities are not eligible for the Vacancy Reduction Program. 

(2) To be eligible under this NOFA, a PHA must: 

(a) Have had a vacancy rate that exceeded 15.9% on March 30, 1993, the date used in the HUD survey of vacancies; 

(b) Have had a receiver appointed for the PHA pursuant to section 6(j)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; or


(c) Have been a designated troubled or mod-troubled PHA any time within the twelve-month period that ended September
1, 1993. Such a PHA must also meet either of the conditions described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) below: 

(i) The PHA has demonstrated substantial progress on the following vacancy related Public Housing Management Assessment
Program (PHMAP) indicators: 1 (Vacancy Number and Percentage), 2 (Modernization), 5 (Unit Turnaround), 6 (Outstanding
Work Orders), or 7 (Annual Inspection and Condition of Units and Systems), as demonstrated by a PHMAP score of ``C''
or better. If the PHA does not have a score of ``C'' or better on these indicators, substantial progress may be demonstrated
as follows: 

(

A

) Evidence that the PHA, based on more recent data would qualify for a score of ``C'' or better on the indicators; or 

(

B

) A statement of alternative arrangements that have been made to assure effective administration of the function
covered by the indicator, i.e., rehabilitation and modernization activities (in regard to the units for which funding
is requested) and the PHA-wide administration of unit turnaround, work orders, and preventive maintenance; or 

(ii) The PHA has provided a reasonable assurance that substantial progress will be made to remedy any management deficiencies
identified by the assessment team, or any vacancy-related management deficiencies related to PHMAP indicators
1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, through activities that have already begun or will be initiated in the next six months, including activities
to be funded under this NOFA. The assurance may cross-reference management improvement activity described in its
vacancy reduction plan.

F. Eligibility of Activities and Costs 



(1) 

Eligible Activities. 

The following activities are eligible for funding to the extent that they are essential to the goal of improving and
maintaining a lower vacancy rate at the PHA. The extent to which activities requested for funding are essential to
the achievement of this goal will be determined by HUD on the basis of the application and the vacancy assessment. 

(a) Management improvements that have the following characteristics: 

(i) The management improvements generally may not exceed 25% of the hard costs to be funded (exclusive of costs for
lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that higher amounts for management improvements
may be approved when such expenditures are deemed by HUD to be critical to the reduction of vacancies in the PHA. Management
improvements include, but are not limited to: activities permitted under paragraph 2-3 of CIAP Handbook 7485.1
(Rev. 4); equal opportunity and civil rights training; and the development of appropriate procedures when there
are management problems regarding the PHA's administration of equal opportunity requirements; and 

(ii) The management improvement costs shall be funded one time only, to cover a period not to exceed three years or,
with regard to PHAs with serious management difficulties, such period as is proposed by the PHA and approved by HUD.
Where an approved Vacancy Reduction Program includes management improvements that involve ongoing costs, such
as security, HUD will not be obligated to provide any continued funding or additional operating subsidy after the
funded period. The PHA shall be responsible for finding other funding sources or reducing its ongoing management
costs. 

(b) Rehabilitation or repair of vacant eligible units to bring the unit at least into compliance with the Housing Quality
Standards (HQS), as set forth in 24 CFR 882.109. Correction of HQS deficiencies outside the unit is not required, unless
the correction of the HQS deficiencies is essential to the marketability of the vacant units in the development. Any
physical component that is replaced must meet the standards for such components set forth in the Public Housing Modernization
Standards Handbook, 7485.2 Rev.1. 

(c) Costs necessary to provide accessibility in eligible units to persons with disabilities, in accordance with
the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.


(d) Lead-based paint activity, as defined in Section I.D of this NOFA, in eligible units. For lead-based paint (LBP)
activities, the PHA is required to comply with 24 CFR part 965, subpart H, and 24 CFR part 35. 

(e) Development-wide improvements that are essential to the marketability of the eligible units, such as improvements
made to enhance security or ``curb appeal.'' 

(f) Reconfiguration of the interior of buildings or units when there is documentation of significant problems in
marketability for the currently available unit size. Documentation for reconfiguration must meet the requirements
of HUD Handbook 7465.1 REV. In addition, where reconfiguration is requested, applicants must document that the lack
of demand for these units is not compounded by the failure of the PHA to transfer inappropriately housed families.
Approval of an application under this NOFA that includes reconfiguration activity will constitute HUD approval
of the reconfiguration and no further HUD approval is necessary. 

(g) When vacancies are attributable to families being overhoused, activities relating to reassigning those families
and repairing of the occupied units made vacant by the reassignment may be included in the PHA request, if the reassignment
is essential to correcting the vacancy problem. However, such units will be considered only if the reassignment and
repair is likely to result in a decrease of the vacancy rate in the PHA. 

(h) Other related activities and improvements eligible under the modernization program (see 24 CFR part 968), such
as administrative expenses, fees and costs, nondwelling structures and equipment, and relocation, but only to the
extent that such costs are necessary to support activity otherwise eligible and are essential to the achievement
and maintenance of a lower vacancy rate. 

(i) Demolition of vacant units, when a demolition application has been approved by HUD and the demolition has not been
previously funded. 

(j) If the PHA has fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1, 1993, the PHA will be reimbursed
for the costs of rehabilitating the formerly vacant units only if funds remain available after the Department has
funded all other eligible costs at all PHAs applying for funds. 

(2) 

Eligible Costs.

 The total amount of funding for which a PHA is eligible is the sum of the following: 

(a) For each development, the necessary costs of rehabilitation of eligible units; development-wide physical improvements,
including common areas; demolition; or reconfiguration. These costs are not to exceed $8,000 times the number of
eligible units in the development at the time of application. 

(b) Necessary costs of management improvements, not to exceed 25% of the total hard costs to be funded for all developments
(exclusive of costs for lead-based paint abatement and handicapped accessibility), except that the Assistant Secretary
may approve higher amounts for management improvements when such expenditures are deemed critical to reduction
of vacancies in the PHA; 

(c) Other related costs as discussed in paragraph (1)(h) (under ``Eligible Activities'') of this Section I.F; 

(d) Necessary costs for lead-based paint containment or abatement in eligible units; and 

(e) Necessary costs for handicapped accessibility for eligible units. 

(3) 

Ineligible Activities. 

Activities are not eligible if the activities are under contract; have been selected for funding from other sources,
such as Urban Revitalization Demonstration (URD) grants, CIAP, or State or local funding; or if the PHA has sufficient
funds in its operating budget or pursuant to its formula grant under the CGP to fund the activities. 

Sufficiency of funds will be determined as follows: 

(a) For hard costs, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds for the activities if the Assessment of Physical
Needs in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than the funds expected to be available to the PHA under
the CGP in the next five years. 

(b) For management improvements, a CGP agency will be deemed to have insufficient funds if: 

(i) For CGP agencies, the Management Needs Assessment in the Comprehensive Plan shows a need for funds greater than
10% of the funds expected to be available to the PHA under its CGP in the next five years; and 

(ii) The PHA plans to use at least 10% of its CGP funds for management improvements in each of the next five years. 

(c) In addition, for CGP and Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) agencies, operating funds will
be deemed to be insufficient only if the PHA has an operating reserve of less than 75% of the maximum allowable reserve.




G. Resident Involvement 



The PHA shall develop a process that assures that residents are fully briefed, have an opportunity to comment on the
proposed content of the PHA's application in response to this NOFA, and to be involved in all phases of the process.
Particular attention shall be given to opportunities for resident employment. The PHA shall give full consideration
to the comments and concerns of residents. The process shall include: 

(1) Informing residents of the applicable housing developments about the preparation of the application, including
a discussion of the report of the assessment team and actions that will be taken to address any deficiencies;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940613-2-00122 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940613-2-00076 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) Once a draft application has been prepared, the PHA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office;
provide copies of the draft to any resident organization representing the residents of any development involved;
and provide adequate opportunity for comment by the residents of the developments and their representative organizations
prior to making the application final;

(3) Providing to HUD and any resident organization representing the development a summary of the resident comments
and the PHA's response to them; and notifying residents of the developments that the summary and responses are available
for reading in the management office; and

(4) After HUD approval of a grant, notifying residents of the development and any representative organizations of
the approval of the grant; providing any resident organization with a copy of the HUD-approved implementation schedule;
notifying the residents that the schedule is available in the management office for reading; and developing a system
to facilitate regular resident monitoring of the program.



H. Resident Training, Employment, and Contracting



The Vacancy Reduction Program provides an ideal opportunity to enhance resident training, employment, and contracting.
In furtherance of HUD goals and priorities, PHAs should, to the greatest extent possible, provide such opportunities
for residents under this program, including development of programs under section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development
Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3). Section 3 requires best efforts on the part of the PHA to give low- and very
low-income persons training and employment opportunities generated by Vacancy Reduction Program assistance,
and to award contracts for work to be performed in connection with Vacancy Reduction Program assistance to business
concerns that provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons. A PHA shall include in its vacancy
reduction plan the projected number of residents the PHA expects to be trained or hired, and the number of business
firms that provide economic opportunity to low- and very low-income persons to be contracted with for vacancy reduction
activities, whether directly by the PHA or through business concerns with which the PHA has contracts for vacancy
reduction activities.



I. Required Results



(1) Except as provided below, funds provided under this NOFA must be expended and units reoccupied within 24 months
from the date of funding, and management improvements must be implemented fully within 3 years from the date of funding.
However, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing may approve alternative schedules proposed by PHAs
with significant management improvement needs. Funds awarded under this program that are not obligated on a timely
basis may be recaptured.

(2) During the funding period, move-ins to developments funded under this program must at least equal the number of
move-outs plus the number of units funded under this program (excluding units that are vacated for modernization
and later reoccupied after modernization). At the end of the funding period, the PHA's current vacancy rate must be
reduced to the extent of the number of units funded under this program.



J. Selection and Funding Process



(1) 

Sufficiency of Application. 

In order to be considered for funding, an application must be complete and consistent with the terms of this NOFA, and
the vacancy reduction plan must generally be consistent with the recommendations of the assessment team. The Department
recognizes that some variance will exist since some of the assessments already conducted concentrated on units that
could be repaired for $10,000 or less. In determining the amount of funds to be reserved for each approvable application,
HUD will review the request for consistency with the recommendations of the assessment team and will consider any
other information HUD may have available. When an approvable vacancy reduction plan submitted in response to this
NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, HUD will require any necessary changes or additions to the plan, and will
assist the PHA in revising its plan, before execution of the amendment of the ACC.

(2) 

Management Deficiencies. 

If a PHA does not adequately address management weaknesses that contribute to its vacancy problem and have been reported
by the assessment team, its application will be deemed ineligible for funding.

(3) 

Funding Decisions. 

When a PHA is requesting funding for eligible units in which rehabilitation costs will exceed an average of $8,000
(see paragraph (1)(a)(ii) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D of this NOFA), HUD will determine
whether the PHA's plan to fund the cost above an average of $8,000 per unit is reasonable. However, no PHA may receive
greater than 15 percent of the total amount of funding available.

(a) 

CIAP Agencies. 

HUD will fully fund all eligible units and associated costs (as defined in Section I.F of this NOFA) for which CIAP agencies
apply.

(b) 

CGP Agencies. 

From the remaining funds HUD will fund eligible applications from CGP agencies to the extent funding is available.
Of the total funds remaining available for CGP agencies, 75 percent will be made available for units eligible under
paragraph (1)(a)(i) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' of this NOFA. The other
25 percent will be made available for units eligible under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition of ``eligible
unit''.

(i) If the amount of funds available is sufficient to fund fully (including the costs of management improvements,
lead-based paint control, and accessibility for the disabled) all CGP agencies in either category of funding, HUD
will fund those requests fully.

(ii) If the total funding requested by CGP agencies in any category exceeds the total amount of funds available in that
category, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be determined as follows, except that an agency will not
be funded at a level exceeding its budget request:

(A) If the amount of available funding is sufficient, each CGP agency will be funded for its eligible costs (exclusive
of management improvements and the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled). If funds
remain available after funding the requested costs under this paragraph, each CGP agency will receive a pro rated
share of the remaining funds, according to the ratio of eligible related costs (i.e., management improvements and
the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled) requested by the agency to the total of eligible
related costs requested by all CGP agencies.

(B) If the amount of available funding is not sufficient to fund all eligible costs costs under paragraph (3)(b)(ii)(A)
of this Section I.J, the funding allocated to each CGP agency will be its pro rata share of funds, determined by using
the same ratio as the number of eligible units in the CGP agency in that category for which funding is requested to the
total number of eligible units in that category for which funding is requested by all applicant CGP agencies.

(iii) If funds remain available in either category and there are unmet needs in the other category, the excess funds
will be reallocated to the category in which additional funding is needed.

(iv) If applications from CGP agencies are not fully funded, those agencies will be required to revise their vacancy
reduction plans and budgets to indicate which items will be funded with the amounts reserved for the CGP agency under
this program and state alternative plans for unfunded vacancies. To the extent that funds are prorated for its units
averaging more than $8,000 in costs, each CGP agency receiving program funds under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition
of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' will be required to commit a portion of the funds the agency
had agreed to commit from independent resources if those units had been funded in the full amount requested. This portion
will be determined by applying (to the total commitment made in the application) the ratio of funding received for
those units to funding requested for those units.

(c) 

Remaining funds. 

If funds remain available after funding all eligible activities under paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section I.J(3), ``Funding
Decisions,'' of this NOFA, a PHA may be reimbursed for costs, or a portion of costs, associated with rehabilitating
certain occupied units. The PHA must have fewer vacancies on the date of its application than it had on September 1,
1993, and must have expended funds on those units in reasonable anticipation of reimbursement from Vacancy Reduction
Program funds.



K. Implementation of Plan and Other Programs



(a) An applicant's vacancy reduction plan must be approved before an application is funded under this NOFA even though,
in most cases, the plan will cover the physical treatment of many units that are not eligible under this NOFA. The PHA
is expected to implement the plan using available funds, including the operating budget and CGP funds, and by requesting
funds under discretionary programs, including CIAP and the Severely Distressed Public Housing Program. HUD will
monitor implementation of the vacancy reduction plan.

(b) Eligible units that a PHA originally planned to fund with CGP funds may also be funded under this NOFA, as long as
they are not currently under contract. The PHA may then reprogram its CGP funds to other work set forth in the Five-Year
Action Plan.
