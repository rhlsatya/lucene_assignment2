MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD







Practices and Procedures



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Merit Systems Protection Board.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Board is amending its practices and procedures to identify the evidence which an agency must provide to show compliance
with an interim relief order and to provide for enforcement of interim relief in circumstances where the sanction
of dismissing the agency's petition for review is ineffective. This amendment revises the Board's regulation to
more precisely reflect the language of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2)(A).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(k), the Board is authorized to prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2).
An appellant who is the prevailing party in an initial decision under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(1) may be entitled to interim
relief pending the outcome of any petition for review under 5 U.S.C. 7701(e). In 

Ginocchi v. Department of the Treasury,

 53 M.S.P.R. 62, 68 n.4 (1992), the Board ruled that it would not entertain motions for compliance with an order of interim
relief and that the appellant's remedy for an agency's failure to provide the ordered interim relief would be a motion
to dismiss the agency's petition for review. However, this sanction is an ineffective means to obtain compliance
in cases where the appellant or an intervenor petitions for review of a decision entitling the appellant to interim
relief, such as a decision mitigating the penalty imposed by the agency. The new  1201.115(c) implements the
Board's determination that in such cases the appropriate enforcement mechanism is the Board's authority to order
withholding of the salary of the agency official responsible for complying with the interim relief order.



Under  1201.115(b)(1), a petition for review or cross petition for review by the agency must be accompanied
by evidence that the agency has provided any interim relief ordered (or by the evidence relating to an ``undue disruption''
determination which is specified in  1201.115(b)(2)). New  1201.116(a) implements 

Ginocchi, supra,

 by providing that the appellant may request dismissal of the agency's petition for failure to provide the required
interim relief (or the required alternative evidence). It clarifies that dismissal may be sought in either the appellant's
response to the agency's petition or in a later motion to dismiss provided the latter is based on information not readily
available before the time limit for responding to the agency's petition for review. New  1201.116(b) provides
for petitions for enforcement of interim relief when such relief is still due after issuance of the final decision
(e.g., a final pay check or a lump sum payment of unused annual leave earned during the interim period) and the relief
sought is not available through a petition for enforcement of the final decision because the appellant is not the prevailing
party.

The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 1204(h).



List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 1201



Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.




Accordingly, the Merit Systems Protection Board amends 5 CFR part 1201 as follows:



PART 1201_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for part 1201 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 1204 and 7701 unless otherwise noted.




2. In  1201.115, paragraph (c) is redesignated as paragraph (d) and paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) are revised
and a new paragraph (c) is added to read as follows:



 1201.115 



Contents of petition for review.



* * * * *



(b)(1) If the appellant was the prevailing party in the initial decision, and the decision granted the appellant interim
relief, any petition for review or cross petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by evidence that
the agency has provided the interim relief required, except when the agency has made a determination as described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. The agency may comply by submitting an SF 50 or SF 52, a letter from an agency official
directing the appellant to return to work and informing the appellant of his or her reinstatement as of the date of the
initial decision, or an affidavit or declaration specifying the manner of the agency's compliance. The interim relief
must be effected retroactively to the date of the initial decision. Cancellation of the appealed action or relief
effected retroactively to the date of the action will result in dismissal of the agency's petition for mootness.

(2) Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(2), if the initial decision provides interim relief which requires that the appellant
be returned to his or her place of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review and the agency determines
that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment, the agency must notify
both the appellant and the judge in writing. The agency must also provide evidence of such notification to the Board
at the time of filing a petition or cross petition for review. The evidence must show that the agency has provided that
the appellant will receive appropriate pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment
from the date of the initial decision until a final decision is issued.

(c) If an appellant or an intervenor files a petition or cross petition for review of an initial decision ordering interim
relief, upon order of the Clerk of the Board the agency must submit evidence that it has provided the interim relief
required (or, where applicable, the evidence specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), 

and 

it must submit the name of the official responsible for compliance. The agency's failure to submit acceptable evidence
of compliance with the interim relief order is a basis for the Board to order the withholding of the salary of the responsible
official pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(A) and 5 CFR 1201.183(c). This sanction is in addition to the dismissal of
an agency petition or cross petition for review provided for in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.



* * * * *



3. Sections 1201.116 through 1201.119 are redesignated as   1201.117 through 1201.120, and a new  1201.116
is added to read as follows:



 1201.116



Appellant requests for enforcement of interim relief.



(a) 

Before a final decision is issued. 

If the agency files a petition for review or a cross petition for review and has not provided required interim relief,
the appellant may request dismissal of the agency's petition. Any such request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board
within 25 days of the date of service of the agency's petition. A copy of the response must be served on the agency at the
same time it is filed with the Board. The agency may respond with evidence and argument to the appellant's request to
dismiss within 15 days of the date of service of the request. If the appellant files a motion to dismiss beyond the time
limit, the Board will dismiss the motion as untimely unless the appellant shows that it is based on information not
readily available before the close of the time limit.

(b) 

After a final decision is issued. 

If the appellant is not the prevailing party in the final Board order, and if the appellant believes that the agency
has not provided full interim relief, the appellant may file an enforcement petition with the regional office under
 1201.182. The appellant must file this petition within 20 days of learning of the agency's failure to provide
full interim relief. If the appellant prevails in the final Board order, then any interim relief enforcement motion
filed will be treated as a motion for enforcement of the final decision. Petitions under this subsection will be processed
under  1201.183.

Food Stamp Program: Utility Reimbursement Exclusion 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Nutrition Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim Rule and request for comments.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action excludes certain utility reimbursements 
made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and 
Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) from income consideration in 
determining Food Stamp Program eligibility and benefits. This 
action will result in increased benefits to households that 
receive the reimbursements, a consistent nationwide policy, 
greater consistency in the treatment of housing and energy 
assistance payments, and more consistency with the Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program.

The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this interim rule in 
conformance with Executive Order 12866 and it has been designated 
``economically significant.'' 


Executive Order 12372 


The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth 
in the final rule in 7 CFR part 3015, Subpart V and related Notice (48 
FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the scope of Executive 
Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with 
State and local officials. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601-612). Ellen 
Haas, the Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, has 
certified that this rule does not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and 
local welfare agencies will be the most affected to the extent 
that they administer the Program. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule does not contain reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements subject to approval by the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 
3507). 


Regulatory Impact Analysis 


Need for Action 


This rule is required to eliminate inconsistent policies 
resulting from litigation, promote equity in the treatment of 
housing and energy assistance, and increase consistency with the 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. 


Benefits 


This action increases benefits to low-income households 
responsible for paying utility expenses separately from their 
rent who receive utility reimbursements from HUD and FmHA. 


Costs 


It is estimated that this action will increase the cost of the 
Food Stamp Program by approximately $13 million for each month of 
its implementation in FY 1994 and $160 million in FY 1995. 



Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect 
with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies 
which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise 
impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to 
have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Effective 
Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial 
challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of 
its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative 
procedures are as follows: (1) For Program benefit recipients_
State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 
2020(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_
administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set 
out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) 
liabilities) or Part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); 
(3) for Program retailers and wholesalers_administrative 
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 
278.8. 


Public Participation and Effective Date 


The provisions of this rulemaking are required to be effective 
and implemented no later than August 1, 1994. Because of the need to establish a consistent 
nationwide policy with respect to the treatment of the specified 
utility reimbursements, Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food 
and Consumer Services, has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, 
that public comment on this rulemaking prior to implementation is 
impracticable. However, because we believe that the 
administration of the rule may be improved by public comment, 
comments are solicited on this rule for 60 days. All comments 
will be analyzed, and any appropriate changes to the rule will be 
incorporated in the subsequent publication of a final rule. 


Background 


The HUD utility reimbursements excluded from Food Stamp Program 
(Program) income consideration by this rule are provided pursuant 
to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Housing Act), 42 
U.S.C. 1437, to comply with a provision of the Housing Act (42 
U.S.C. 1437a(a)(1)) that requires HUD to limit the shelter costs 
of tenants in Federally assisted housing to 30 percent of their 
income. In calculating a tenant's rent payment, HUD has 
interpreted the term ``rent'' to include the cost of utilities and 
other services, including electricity, gas, heating fuel, water 
and sewerage, and trash and garbage collection (24 CFR 813.102, 
965.472, 965.476). In some housing, utilities are included in 
the tenant's rent. In units in which the utilities are paid 
directly by the tenant, HUD permits a deduction to be made from 
the rent paid to the owner on account of the separate payment 
being made to the utility supplier. This deduction, provided for 
in 24 CFR 813.102 and 913.102, for the estimated value of 
utilities and charges for other housing services payable directly 
by the family is called a ``utility allowance.'' The amount of the 
utility allowance is based, not on an individual family's 
expenses, but on a community-wide standard. Therefore, the 
tenant's actual utility costs may be more or less than the 
allowance.

<TEXT>
 

For most tenants, the amount of the utility allowance is less 
than the amount they are required to pay toward their rent 
including utilities. In most cases, the utility allowance 
involves no direct payment to the household, but is merely a 
credit reducing the household's contribution to the landlord. If 
the utility allowance exceeds the rent that can be charged for a 
dwelling, the excess is paid in the form of a ``utility 
reimbursement'' or rebate to the household. 


Similar reimbursements are made to some rural low-income 
households by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) of the 
Department of Agriculture as part of its Rental Assistance 
Program which provides, pursuant to 7 CFR pt. 1930, subpt. C; pt. 
1944, subpt. E, loans for housing in rural areas. Under the FmHA 
Program, the borrower (the owner of the property) may apply for 
Rental Assistance for each tenant in the project who meets the 
eligibility criteria. The Rental Assistance payment equals the 
difference between 30 percent of the household's income and the 
sum of the rent plus the utility allowance for the project. If 
the tenant pays the utilities, the total Rental Assistance 
payment from FmHA is made to the owner, who is obligated to pass 
on to the tenant the portion allocated to utilities. When FmHA's 
utility allowance is more than 30 percent of the household's 
adjusted income, the landlord is obligated to forward the 
difference to the tenant as a utility reimbursement. 

Under section 5(d) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 
2014(d)), any income received by the household directly or 
indirectly must be counted in determining the household's 
eligibility and benefits, except for the exclusions listed in the 
Act. Neither the Food Stamp Act nor current regulations 
specifically address the treatment of HUD and FmHA utility 
reimbursements. It is clear that Federal energy assistance 
payments are excluded by section 5(d)(11) of the Food Stamp Act. 
However, the HUD and FmHA reimbursements are not provided 
specifically for energy assistance alone. Current policy 
requires counting these HUD utility reimbursements as income. 
This policy is applicable nationwide except in jurisdictions in 
which the reimbursements are excluded by judicial decision.
 
In the past, it was our policy that utility reimbursements did 
not qualify as energy assistance. In response to questions 
concerning the payments, we issued Policy Memo 90-6 addressing 
HUD payments and Policy Memo 3-91-04 regarding FmHA payments. 
Policy Memo 90-6 provides that any amount paid by HUD directly to 
the household as a utility reimbursement or indirectly to the 
utility provider must be counted as income to the household. 
Under Policy Memo 3-91-04, the utility reimbursement paid by the 
landlord to the tenant is counted as income to the household. 

This policy has been maintained over several years and has been 
successfully defended in court on a number of occasions. While 
we believe the current policy is a permissible interpretation of 
the statute, we believe it is not in the best interest of the 
Program to continue to litigate this issue. In reexamining the 
policy, we have determined that there are several compelling 
reasons to change the policy so as to exclude the utility 
reimbursements in the future. 

First, although the HUD and FmHA utility reimbursements are not 
provided specifically for energy assistance, a substantial 
portion of a household's utility expense is for heating and 
cooling. A change in policy to exclude the utility 
reimbursements is not inconsistent with the specific exclusion in 
section 5(d)(11) of the Food Stamp Act and 7 CFR 273.9(c)(11) for 
Federal energy assistance. Excluding the utility reimbursements 
under the existing regulatory provision would achieve consistency 
in the treatment of Federal energy assistance. 

Second, the current policy is inconsistent with the policy of the 
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program in most 
States. Increasing consistency between the Food Stamp and AFDC 
Programs is a Department priority because it makes the Programs 
simpler to administer and more understandable to households. 

Maintaining the current policy also causes inconsistent treatment 
of households in subsidized housing between those in traditional 
housing whose utilities are included in their rent and households 
who are responsible for paying their own utility expenses. 
Excluding the utility reimbursements would provide greater 
consistency in treatment of various forms of housing assistance. 

Finally, a change in policy eliminates the need to maintain at 
least two distinct and conflicting policies for the foreseeable 
future because courts in some jurisdictions have affirmed the 
current policy and others have found it insupportable. 


Therefore, this rule amends 7 CFR 273.9(c)(11) to provide that 
payments or allowances made for the purpose of providing energy 
assistance under any Federal law, including HUD and FmHA 
reimbursements, are excluded from income. We are making a 
conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to provide that a 
utility expense which is reimbursed or paid by an excluded 
payment, including HUD or FmHA utility payments, shall not be 
deductible. In accordance with Section 5(e) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 
2014(e), households that receive these payments will be entitled 
to use a standard utility allowance that includes a heating or 
cooling component only if they incur heating or cooling costs 
that exceed the amount of the excluded payment.

Avocados Grown in South Florida and Imported Avocados; Changes to Maturity and Reporting Requirements 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule revises minimum maturity requirements and suspends certain reporting requirements for avocados
grown in South Florida. This rule is designed to ensure that only mature fruit is shipped to the fresh market, thereby
improving grower and importer returns and promoting orderly marketing conditions. For avocados imported into the
United States, this final rule reinstates maturity requirements with certain revisions; adds an exemption for certain
avocado varieties; removes the exemption for avocados grown in the southern hemisphere; and adds exemptions from
maturity requirements for avocados imported for certain uses. This rule is needed so that imported avocados meet
the same minimum size and color maturity requirements as those established for avocados under the Federal marketing
order covering Florida avocados, consistent with section 8e of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Order No. 915 (7 CFR part 915), as amended, regulating the
handling of avocados grown in South Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the
Act. 



This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities, including avocados, imported into the United
States that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities, under Federal marketing
orders. The Secretary has determined that the maturity requirements for imported avocados should be the same as those
established for avocados grown in South Florida under the order. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of the import rule. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. Import regulations issued
under the Act are based on those established under Federal marketing orders. 

There are about 65 avocado handlers subject to regulation under the marketing order covering avocados grown in Florida
and about 95 avocados producers in South Florida. There are about 20 avocado importers who will be subject to the avocado
import maturity requirements. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms, which
include avocado handlers and importers, have been defined by the Small Business Administration as those having annual
receipts of less than $5,000,000. The majority of the Florida avocado handlers and producers, and avocado importers
may be classified as small entities.

 [59 FR 15658 and 15661] and provided 30 days to interested persons to file comments. No comments were received. However,
several typographical and printing errors were identified in both proposed rules as published. This final rule corrects
the errors in Table I of both rules: (1) For the Booth 8 variety after October 10, the minimum diameter is changed from
33/16 to 31/16 inches; (2) for the Chica variety after October 3, the minimum diameter is changed from 31/16 to 34/16
inches. 

The Avocado Administrative Committee (committee) works with the Department in administering the order, and it meets
prior to and during each season to consider recommendations for modification, suspension, or termination of the
regulatory requirements for Florida avocados. 

The committee met December 8, 1993, and unanimously recommended that the shipping schedules for avocados be revised
and that certain reporting requirements be temporarily suspended. Committee meetings are open to the public and
interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations,
information submitted by the committee and other information, and determines whether modification, suspension,
or termination of the regulatory requirements would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 

Maturity requirements for avocados grown in Florida, based on minimum weights, diameters, and skin color, are specified
in  915.322 [7 CFR 915.322], and are in effect on a continuous basis. These maturity requirements specify minimum
weights and diameters for specific shipping periods for some 60 varieties of avocados, and color specifications
for those varieties which turn red or purple when mature. The maturity requirements for the various varieties of avocados
are different, because each variety has different characteristics. The maturity requirements for each avocado
variety are based on maturity test results. 

These maturity requirements are designed to prevent shipments of immature avocados to the fresh market, especially
during the early part of the harvest season for each variety. Providing fresh markets with mature fruit is an important
aspect of creating consumer satisfaction and is in the interest of both producers and consumers. Fresh shipments
of Florida avocados usually begin with light shipments of early varieties in May, and they continue until the following
March or April, with heaviest shipments occurring from July through December.

This final rule revises the shipping schedules for the avocado varieties specified in Table I of paragraph (a)(2)
of  915.322 (7 CFR part 915.322) to synchronize those schedules with any calendar year. The previous schedules
needed to be adjusted to each new year to ensure that dates and weekdays conformed to each new year. The schedules in
Table I are similar to previous calendars, except that the maturity schedules have fixed dates, which become effective
on the Monday nearest the date specified in Table I. The new schedules are expected to conform more closely to the needs
of the industry. This final rule also exempts from maturity requirements the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties
of avocados, since these varieties of avocados are not commercially grown in the production area in Florida. 

A minimum grade requirement of U.S. No. 2 currently in effect on a continuous basis for avocados grown in Florida under
 915.306 (7 CFR part 915.306), and for avocados imported into the United States under  944.28 (7 CFR part
944.28) remains in effect unchanged by this action. 

Florida avocado handlers may ship, exempt from the minimum grade, size, and maturity requirements effective under
the order, up to 55 pounds of avocados during any one day under a minimum quantity provision, and up to 20 pounds of avocados
as gift packs in individually addressed containers. Also, avocados grown in Florida utilized for commercial processing
are not subject to the grade, size, and maturity requirements under the order. 

Paragraph (d) of  915.150 (7 CFR part 915.150), currently requires that each handler, at the end of the day's
operation, report to the committee the number of containers (1/4 Bushel, 1/2 Bushel, and 4/5 Bushel) of avocados sold
and delivered within the State of Florida. This final action suspends paragraph (d) of  915.150 for the next
two seasons, through March 31, 1996. This temporarily suspends the requirement that handlers file the ``Avocado
Handler Daily Size Report Form'' which takes about 0.083 hours to complete for each report. The committee has determined
that information needed for operations, marketing policies, and compliance, could sufficiently be obtained from
inspection certificates collected on a daily basis by program staff, and that information collected on the ``Avocado
Handler Daily Size Report Form'' will not be needed for the next two seasons. Further, Hurricane Andrew reduced avocado
production by almost half, and this has reduced assessment collections, resulting in a need to reduce staff and administration
costs. 

This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size,
quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States, including avocados,
that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under Federal marketing orders.


Minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity requirements for imported avocados in  944.31 (7
CFR 944.31) were continuously in effect for several years prior to their suspension by a final rule issued May 15, 1991
(56 FR 23009, May 20, 1991). The avocado import maturity requirements were temporarily suspended to provide the United
States Trade Representative (USTR) adequate time to review contemplated changes in those requirements, as required
by section 8e of the Act. Suspension of the avocado import maturity requirements became necessary when the Florida
avocado maturity requirements in  915.332 (7 CFR 915.332), upon which the avocado import maturity requirements
were based, were revised on May 15, 1991 (56 FR 23005, May 20, 1991). This revision was finalized on September 4, 1991
(56 FR 46224, September 11, 1991). Section 915.332 was most recently amended to make calendar date adjustments in
the shipping schedule for several varieties of Florida avocados on June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34684, June 29, 1993), and that
rule was finalized on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 46759, September 3, 1993). 

Prior to suspension, the avocado import maturity requirements were based on minimum weights and diameters applied
to avocados grown in all foreign countries, except for those grown in southern hemisphere countries. Such requirements
were applied to each variety for a specific time period during the first part of the shipping period. The minimum weights
or diameters were not applied to avocados grown in southern hemisphere countries, such as Chile, where practically
all imported southern hemisphere avocados have originated in recent years, because the southern hemisphere's avocado
growing season and various shipping periods differ from those in Florida. The import maturity requirements based
on minimum weights or diameters were applied to avocados grown in northern hemisphere countries, such as those in
the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic, where practically all northern hemisphere imported avocados have originated
in recent years, because their growing season and various shipping periods are similar to those in Florida. 

The avocado import maturity requirements based on skin color for certain varieties of avocados which turn red, purple
or black when mature were applied to avocados imported from all foreign countries in both the southern and northern
hemispheres. Such requirements applied to all avocados grown in both hemispheres, because all such avocados turn
color when mature regardless of where they are grown.

This final rule also reinstates the minimum size (weight and diameter) requirements for avocados and the skin color
maturity requirements for avocados imported from all foreign countries by lifting the suspended provisions of  944.31.
However, this final rule exempts the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties of avocados from such import maturity
requirements, because such varieties are not grown in commercial quantities in Florida and regulated under the Florida
avocado maturity requirements in  915.332. 

This final rule obviates the need for exempting avocados imported from the southern hemisphere, since the major varieties
imported from the southern hemisphere are the Hass, Fuerte, Zutano, and Edranol varieties. 

This final rule also adds language to  944.31 to cite the minimum size (weight and diameter) and skin color maturity
requirements, and define the term ``diameter''. 

This final rule also exempts imported avocados under  944.31 from minimum weight, diameter, and color maturity
requirements if they are to be used in certain specified outlets. Similar exemptions from grade requirements established
for imported avocados under  944.28 were implemented by an interim final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 [58 FR 69182, December 30, 1993], with an effective date of January 1, 1994. 

The avocado import maturity regulation [7 CFR 944.31] is based on the maturity requirements in effect for avocados
grown in Florida under the order throughout the year. Under the order, any person may handle avocados without regard
to established grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements provided that such avocados are handled for (1) consumption
by charitable institutions; (2) distribution by relief agencies; (3) commercial processing into products; (4)
seed; or (5) individual shipments of up to 55 pounds. Prior to issuance of this rule, the only exemption allowed under
the avocado import regulation was that for individual shipments of up to 55 pounds. Thus, this final rule adds consumption
by charitable institutions, distribution by relief agencies, seed, and commercial processing into products to
the list of exemptions allowed under the avocado import regulation. 

To ensure that imported avocados exempt from the maturity requirements are utilized in exempt outlets, this rule
states that such avocados be subject to the safeguard procedures for imported fruit established in  944.350
[58 FR 69182, December 30, 1993]. 

Under these procedures, an importer wishing to import avocados covered herein for uses in other than regulated commercial
channels, must complete in triplicate, prior to importation, an ``Importer's Exempt Commodity Form.'' One copy
will notify the Marketing Order Administration Branch (MOAB) of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, and the second
copy will notify the U.S. Customs Service of the importer's intent to import a commodity under an exemption. The third
copy will accompany the exempt lot to the receiver. 

The form may be obtained from either the inspection or customs offices serving the port of entry. The form may also be
obtained from the MOAB in Washington, DC or from its Marketing Field Offices in Fresno, California; Portland, Oregon;
McAllen, Texas; or Winter Haven, Florida. 

The form must be completed at the time the commodity enters the United States. Copies are to be returned to the U.S. Customs
Service at the time the commodity is offered for importation and to MOAB within 15 days after completion of the form.
Information called for on the ``Importer's Exempt Commodity Form'' includes: 






(1) The commodity and the variety (if known) being imported, 
(2) The date and place of inspection, if applicable, 
(3) Identifying marks or numbers on the containers, 
(4) Identifying numbers on the railroad car, truck or other transportation vehicle transporting product to the receiver,

(5) The name and address of the importer, 
(6) The place and date of entry, 
(7) The quantity imported, 
(8) the name and address of the intended receiver (eg. processor, feeder, charity, or other exempt receiver), 
(9) Intended use of the exempt commodity, 
(10) The U.S. Customs Service entry number and harmonized tariff code number, and 
(11) Such other information as may be necessary to ensure compliance with this regulation.

For purposes of this regulation, a lot is considered to be imported when it is released by the Customs Service for entry
into commercial markets or other channels. Lots that are exempt from maturity requirements of the import regulations
are not subject to the inspection and certification requirements in such regulations. An imported lot intended for
normal commercial channels, or any portion of such a lot, that fails established maturity requirements, could be
disposed of in exempt outlets, as specified in the pertinent avocado import requirements. 

The third copy of the form will accompany the exempt lot to its intended destination. The receiver will then certify
that the lot has been received and it will be utilized in an exempt outlet. After the certification is signed by the receiver,
the form is to be returned to MOAB by the receiver, within 15 days of receipt of the lot. 

The information collection requirements contained in this final rule have been previously approved by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35], and have
been assigned OMB numbers 0581-0078 for avocados grown in South Florida and 0581-0167 for imported avocados.


In accordance with section 8e of the Act, the USTR has concurred with the issuance of this final rule. 

This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to make the specified changes.
The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on producers and handlers since it will help
ensure that only mature avocados are shipped to fresh markets. The committee considers that maturity requirements
for Florida grown avocados are necessary to improve grower returns and promote orderly marketing conditions. Although
compliance with these maturity requirements will affect costs to handlers, these costs will be offset by the benefits
of providing the industry and consumers with mature avocados. 

This final rule also reflects the Department's appraisal of the need to reinstate the suspended avocado import maturity
requirements, with the specified revisions, as hereinafter set forth, in accordance with section 8e of the Act. 

Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee,
and other information, it is found that this final rule as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared
policy of the Act. 

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date
of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The shipping season for South Florida avocados is expected to begin in late May; (2) avocado handlers
are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the committee; (3) notice of the proposed rules were
published in the 

Federal Register

, and no comments were received during the 30-day comment period.

Tokay Grapes Grown in San Joaquin County, California; Expenses and Assessment Rate for 1994-95 Fiscal Year



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim final rule with request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim final rule authorizes expenditures and establishes an assessment rate for the Tokay Grape Industry
Committee (committee) under Marketing Order (M.O.) No. 926 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Authorization of this
budget enables the committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds
to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This interim final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 926 [7 CFR Part 926] regulating the handling
of Tokay grapes grown in San Joaquin County, California. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674], hereinafter referred to as the Act. 


The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing
order provisions now in effect, Tokay grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the
assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable Tokay grapes handled during the 1994-95
fiscal year, beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This interim final rule will not preempt any state or
local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
There are three handlers of Tokay grapes regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 15 Tokay
grape producers in San Joaquin County, California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service
firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers
may be classified as small entities. 
The Tokay grape marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular
fiscal year apply to all assessable grapes handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are
prepared by the committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted
to the Department for approval. The members of the committee are grape handlers and producers. They are familiar with
the committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
The assessment rate recommended by the committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of grapes. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the committee's expected expenses. 
The committee met on April 29, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenditures of $5,150 with an assessment
rate of $0.07 per carton for the 1994-95 fiscal year. In comparison, the expenditure amount and the assessment
rate are remaining unchanged from the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994-95 fiscal year, estimated at $4,500, will be within the maximum permitted
by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted
by the committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend
to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis;
(2) the fiscal year for the committee began April 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
for the fiscal year apply to all assessable grapes handled during the fiscal year; (3) handlers are aware of this action
which was unanimously recommended by the committee at a public meeting and which is similar to budgets issued in past
years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered
prior to finalization of this action.

Olives Grown in California; Expenses and Assessment
 Rate for 1994 Fiscal Year





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim
final rule that authorized expenditures and established an assessment rate for the California Olive Committee (Committee)
under Marketing Order (M.O.) No. 932 for the 1994 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee
to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program
are derived from assessments on handlers.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 148 and Marketing Order No. 932 (7 CFR Part 932), as amended,
regulating the handling of olives grown in California. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the
Act.



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, olives grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate specified
herein will be applicable to all assessable olives handled during the 1994 fiscal year, beginning January 1, 1994,
through December 31, 1994. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.

Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 5 handlers of olives regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 1,350
olive producers in California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration
(13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. None of the handlers may be classified as small entities.
The majority of the producers may be classified as small entities.

The marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year
apply to all assessable olives handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by
the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department
for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of California olives. They are familiar with
the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position
to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus,
all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.

The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of olives. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient
income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.

The California Olive Committee met on December 14, 1993, and unanimously recommended a total expense amount of $3,748,290,
for its 1994 budget. This is $928,530 more in expenses than the previous year. The increase is primarily due to additional
funding for market development.

The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $27.21 per ton for the 1994 fiscal year, which is
$1.46 more in the assessment rate from the 1993 fiscal year. The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments
of 101,000 tons, would yield $2,748,210 in assessment income. This, along with approximately $1,000,000 from the
Committee's authorized reserves will be adequate to cover estimated expenses.

Major expense categories for the 1994 fiscal year include $1,150,000 for the market expansion program, $990,860
for consumer affairs, and $173,730 for salaries. Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $300,000
will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.

While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

An interim final rule was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12526, March 17, 1994) and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.

It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the
declared policy of the Act.

It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 

Federal Register

 (5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994 fiscal year for the program began January 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment
apply to all assessable olives handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which
was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the 

Federal Register

 as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action
as a final rule without change.

Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of extension of compliance date.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is announcing an extension of the date for enforcing compliance with
its nutrition labeling regulations. The effective date of the final nutrition labeling regulations published on
January 6, 1993, will remain July 6, 1994. However, FSIS will not take enforcement action on such meat and poultry product
labeling until August 8, 1994. In addition, FSIS is providing notice that temporary label approvals, granted by the
Food Labeling Division in conjunction with the July 6, 1994, rule, will now expire on August 8, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 6, 1993, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 a final rule titled ``Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products'' (58 FR 638). Corrections and technical amendments
to this final rule were published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43787), and on September 10, 1993 (59 FR 47624), respectively.
The technical amendments, which were issued as an interim final rule, were confirmed as final on March 16, 1994 (59
FR 12157). The effective date of the final rule is July 6, 1994. 


The final rule amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to permit voluntary nutrition
labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products, and establishes a mandatory nutrition labeling program
for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations are designed
to parallel, to the extent possible, the nutrition labeling regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for all other foods. Both agencies cooperated closely in the development and timeframe for implementation
of their respective rules. 
FDA's final nutrition labeling regulations became effective on May 8, 1994. However, Congress recently amended
the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) to extend the compliance date for certain FDA-regulated food
products packaged prior to August 8, 1994, to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements. The legislation (S.
2087) was passed by both houses of Congress, and signed into law by the President on May 27, 1994. Although it is not subject
to the NLEA, FSIS has decided not to take any enforcement action on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products
until August 8, 1994. FSIS believes that this date is reasonable and practical, and reflects its continued cooperation
with FDA on nutrition labeling issues. FSIS also believes that the extended timeframe further minimizes the cost
of complying with the regulations and allows for a more orderly and uniform compliance implementation for nutrition
labeling of all foods. 
In anticipation of the July 6, 1994, effective date, the Food Labeling Division has granted temporary label approvals
under 9 CFR 317.4(d) and 381.132(b) of the regulations. These temporary approvals were granted for labels which comply
with current regulations, but which would not comply with the regulations when the final rule issued on January 6,
1993, is effective. These temporary approvals are automatically extended until August 8, 1994. 
FSIS encourages manufacturers to revise their labels as soon as possible. On and after August 8, 1994, products with
labeling that does not comply with the nutrition labeling regulations will be misbranded and subject to enforcement
action by FSIS.

Indiana Regulatory Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule; approval of amendment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 OSM is announcing the approval of a proposed program amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The amendment
( Program Amendment 93-5) consists of changes to the Indiana Administrative Code (IAC) rules at 310 IAC 12. The
proposed amendment pertains to definitions of terms used in the Indiana program. The amendment is intended to revise
the Indiana program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



I. Background on the Indiana Program.

II. Submission of Amendment.

III. Director's Findings.

IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments.

V. Director's Decision.

VI. Procedural Determinations.



I. Background on the Indiana Program



On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition
of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found in the July
26, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 32071). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at
30 CFR 914.10, 914.15, and 914.16.



II. Submission of the Amendment



By letter dated July 2, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND-1272), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) submitted proposed program amendment number 93-5. Program amendment 93-5 consists of proposed
changes to the Indiana program definitions at 310 IAC 12-0.5.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 5, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41669), and, in the same notice, opened the public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearing
on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The comment period closed on September 7, 1993. The scheduled public hearing
was not held as no one requested an opportunity to provide testimony.



III. Director's Findings



Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17 are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program. Revisions not specifically discussed below concern nonsubstantive
wording changes, or revised cross-references and paragraph notations to reflect organizational changes resulting
from this amendment.



A. Revisions to Indiana's Rules That Are Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Federal Regulations






Because the above proposed revisions are identical in meaning to the corresponding Federal regulations, the Director
finds that Indiana's proposed rules are no less effective than the Federal regulations.



B. Revisions to Indiana's Rules That Are Not Substantively Identical to the Corresponding Federal Regulations



1. 310 IAC 12-0.5-6 Affected Area

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00023 </DOCNO>

In the introductory paragraph, Indiana has deleted the word ``each'' and added the word ``any'' in its place. With
this change, Indiana has clarified that ``affected area'' means any one or more of the specified examples at subsection
6 (1) through (7). The Director finds that the proposed change is substantively identical to the counterpart Federal
regulations at 30 CFR 701.5 concerning the definition of ``affected area.'' The Director notes that the Indiana definition
of ``affected area'' continues to be the subject of a required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 914.16(n) (see
58 FR 43260, August 16, 1993).



2. 310 IAC 12-0.5-53 Ground Cover



The term 

ground cover

 is defined to mean the area of ground which is covered by the combined aerial parts of vegetation and the litter that
is produced naturally onsite, expressed as percentage of the total area of measurement. At least 95 percent of the
species present must be species listed in the revegetation plan.

The first sentence of the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``ground cover''
at 30 CFR 701.5. Indiana added the second sentence to establish a standard guideline for all to follow. The Director
finds that the second sentence is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations.



3. 310 IAC 12-0.5-139 Valid Existing Rights (VER)



Indiana has proposed the following language for the definition of VER:

(a) 

Valid existing rights

 means, for the purposes of 310 IAC 12-1-1, 310 IAC 12-2-1, and 310 IAC 12-2-5 the
following:

(1) Except for haul roads:

(A) Those property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, that were created by a legally binding conveyance, lease,
deed, contract, or other document which authorized the applicant to conduct surface coal mining operations; and

(B) The person proposing to conduct surface coal mining operations on such lands:

(i) Had been validly issued or exercised good faith effort to obtain, on or before August 3, 1977, all state and federal
permits necessary to conduct operations on those lands;

(ii) Can demonstrate to the director that the coal is both needed for and immediately adjacent to, an ongoing surface
mining operation for which all permits were obtained prior to August 3, 1977; or

(iii) Can demonstrate that the operation was in existence or operation at the time an area became protected under IC
13-4.1-14-1 or at the time of the coming into existence, within the prohibited distance of a structure,
road, cemetery, or other activity listed in IC 13-4.1-14-1.

(2) For haul roads:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(A) A recorded right-of-way, recorded easement, or a permit for a coal haul road recorded as of August 3, 1977;

(B) Any other road in existence as of August 3, 1977; or

(C) Any haul road that was in existence or operating at the time an area became protected under IC 13-4.1-14-1,
or at the time of the coming into existence, within the prohibited distance of a structure, road, cemetery, or other
activity listed in IC 13-4.1-14-1.

(b) The interpretation of the terms of a document used to establish a valid existing right is based upon the common law
concerning the interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights. If there is no applicable common law, the interpretation
is based upon the following:

(1) The usage and custom at the time and place where a document came into existence.

(2) A showing by the applicant that the parties to the document contemplated the right to conduct the same underground
or surface activities for which the applicant claims a valid existing right.

(c) ``Valid existing rights'' does not mean the mere expectation of a right to conduct surface coal mining operations
or the right to conduct underground coal mining. Examples of rights which alone do not constitute valid existing rights
include, but are not limited to, coal exploration permits or licenses, applications or bids for leases, or where a
person has only applied for a federal or state permit.

(d) If an area comes under the protection of IC 13-4.1-14-1 after August 3, 1977, valid existing rights
are present if a validly authorized surface coal mining operation exists on that area on the date the protection comes
into existence.

The Federal definition of VER at 30 CFR 761.5 has been affected by judicial decision and parts have been suspended by
OSM (see 51 FR 41954, November 20, 1986). Specifically, 30 CFR 761.5 paragraphs (a) and (c) are suspended, and subparagraph
(d)(2) is suspended insofar as it incorporates the takings test of suspended paragraph (a). Additionally, OSM has
proposed that the Federal VER definition be amended (see 56 FR 33152, July 18, 1991).

In the November 20, 1986, 

Federal Register

 notice which suspended 30 CFR 761.5(a), OSM stated that the suspension of 30 CFR 761.5(a) has the effect of undoing
that provision and leaving in its place the VER test in use before the suspended language was promulgated (the 1979
test) (51 FR 41954). That 1979 test consists of language approved on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15342). A suspension and interpretation
of the 1979 test was published in the August 4, 1980, 

Federal Register

 (45 FR 51547). This suspension resulted from judicial review of the 1979 test, wherein the court remanded to the Secretary
that portion of the 1979 test which required the property owner to have obtained all permits necessary to mine (``all
permits'' test, 30 CFR 761.5(a)(2)(i)). [In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation, No. 79-1144
(D.D.C. 1980)]. Specifically, the court indicated that a good faith attempt to obtain all permits before the August
3, 1977, cut-off date should suffice for meeting the ``all permits'' test. In Re: Permanent (I), Mem. op. at 20. To comply
with the court's 1980 opinion, OSM suspended the definition only insofar as it required that to establish VER, all
permits must have been obtained prior to August 3, 1977. (45 FR 51547, 51548, August 4, 1980)

The November 20, 1986, notice of suspension restated OSM's position that, pending further rulemaking, OSM would
interpret the regulation as including the court's suggestion that a good faith effort to obtain all permits would
establish VER. Consequently, in Federal program States and on Indian lands, OSM will make VER determinations on a
case-by-case basis, and will consider property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which by that date
had made a good faith effort to obtain all permits, as one class of circumstances which would invariably entitle the
property owner to VER. This is referred to as the 1980 test. VER would also exist when there are property rights in existence
on August 3, 1977, the owner of which can demonstrate that the coal is both needed for and immediately adjacent to a mining
operation in existence prior to August 3, 1977 (51 FR 41954, 41955).

Indiana's proposed VER language at subsection 139(a)(1)(A) and (B)(i) and (ii) is substantively identical to the
two classes of VER contained in the 1979 rule, at former 30 CFR 761.5(a)(1) and (2). Because these portions of the 1979
rule, including the ``good faith, all permits'' interpretation of the ``all-permits test'' contained in former
30 CFR 761.5(a)(2)(i) have been upheld by the court, the Director is approving the proposed language at subsection
139(a)(1)(A) and (B)(i) and (ii).

The proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) is substantively identical to the Federal language at 30
CFR 761.5(d)(1). The Director notes, however, that the proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) duplicates
the intent of the proposed language at subdivision 139(d). In response to a comment from OSM about this duplication,
Indiana stated the duplicative language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) will be deleted at the next available
opportunity. The Director agrees that, for clarity, the duplicative language should be removed at Indiana's earliest
opportunity. The Director finds that the proposed language at subdivision 139(A)(1)(B)(iii), while duplicative,
is no less effective than the Federal regulations.

The Director finds the proposed provisions for haulroads at subdivisions 139(a)(2) (A) and (B) are substantively
identical to and no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(b) (1) and (2). The proposed
provision at subdivision 139(a)(2)(C) does not have a direct Federal counterpart. The Director finds the Indiana
language to be consistent with the Federal provision at 30 CFR 761.5(d)(1) which provides for VER if, on the date an
area comes under protection pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, a validly authorized surface coal mining operation
exists on that area. The Director is, therefore, approving the proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(2).

The proposed Indiana language at subdivisions 139(b) and (b)(1) is similar to the counterpart Federal language at
30 CFR 761.5(e). The Federal language, however, provides that the interpretation of the terms of the document relied
upon to establish the VER shall be based on either applicable State statutory or case law concerning interpretation
of documents conveying mineral rights. Also, the Federal language provides that where no applicable State law exists,
the interpretation of the terms of the document relied upon to establish VER shall be based upon the usage and custom
at the time and place that it came into existence. The counterpart Indiana language at subdivision 139(b) is silent
concerning applicable State statutory law. The proposed language only provides that if there is no applicable common
law the provisions at subdivisions 139(b) (1) and (2) apply. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed language
at subdivision 139(b) no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(e) except to the
extent that the proposed Indiana rule is silent concerning the applicability of State statutory law. In addition,
the Director is requiring that Indiana further amend 310 IAC 12-0.5-139(b) to provide that the interpretation
of the terms of the document used to establish a valid existing right shall be based either upon applicable State statutory
or case law concerning interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights, or where no applicable State statutory
or common law exists, the interpretation is based upon the provisions at subdivisions 139(b) (1) and (2).

Proposed subdivision 139(b)(2), concerning a required showing by the applicant that the parties to the document
contemplated the right to conduct the same mining activities for which the applicant claims VER, has no direct Federal
counterpart.

The proposed language, however, is not inconsistent with the Federal requirements contained in the 1979 VER rule,
at former 30 CFR 761.5(c) and is, therefore, approved.

Proposed subsection 139(c) has no direct Federal counterpart. The Director finds the proposed language to be a valuable
clarification of VER and not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal VER regulations. In addition, the language is
substantively identical to the language contained in the 1979 VER rule at former 30 CFR 761.5(d). Therefore, proposed
subsection 139(c) is approved.

Proposed subsection 139(d) is substantively identical to the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5(d)(1)
and is, therefore, approved.

The Director finds the proposed definition of VER, except as discussed above, to be consistent with an no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 761.5 and the 1980 test (the 1979 VER rule with the ``good faith, all permits test''
interpretation) as discussed in the November 20, 1986, 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 41954).



C. Revisions to Indiana's Regulations With No Corresponding Federal Regulations



1. 310 IAC 12-0.5-72 Litter



The term 

litter

 is defined to mean the detached recognizable portions of the plants under evaluation that cover the ground surface.
The Federal regulations use the term 

litter

 in definition of 

ground cover

, but a Federal definition of the term 

litter

 is not provided. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana stated that its definition of the term 

litter

 is based on the terms 

litter

 and ``crop residue found in the ``Resource Conservation Glossary,'' Third edition, Soil Conservation Society of
America, 1982, page 188, and the needs and conditions of the Indiana program. The Director finds the proposed definition
to be consistent with and no less effective than the Federal use of the term 

litter

 as it appears in the definition of ``ground cover'' at 30 CFR 701.5.



2. 310 IAC 12-0.5-111 Shelter Belt



This term is defined to mean an area used for protection from wind or snow and which is subject to proof-of-productivity
standards for fish and wildlife habitat. In its submittal of this definition, Indiana stated that its definition
of the term 

shelter belt

 is modeled after the definition of the same term as found in the ``Resource Conservation Glossary,'' Third edition,
Soil Conservation Society of America, 1982, page 145. There is no direct Federal counterpart to this definition.
However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3) use the term ``shelter belts'' in the regulations for
the standards for success for postmining land use of fish and wildlife habitat. The Director finds the proposed definition
to be consistent with and no less effective than the Federal use of the term ``shelter belts'' at 30 CFR 816/817.116(b)(3).

3. 310 IAC 12-0.5-116 Soil Productivity


This term is defined to mean the capacity of a soil for producing a specified plant or sequence of plants under a physically
defined set of management practices. In its submittal of this definition, Indiana stated that its definition of the
term ``soil productivity'' is modeled after the definition of the same term as found in the ``Resource Conservation
Glossary,'' Third edition, Soil Conservation Society of America, 1982, page 159. There is no direct Federal counterpart
to this definition. However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.15 use the term soil productivity in the regulations
on prime farmland revegetation and restoration. The Director finds the proposed definition to be consistent with
the Federal use of the term ``soil productivity'' at 30 CFR 823.15.


IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments


Agency Comments


Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested
Federal agencies. No agency comments were received on the proposed amendments.


Public Comments


The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the August 5, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 41669). The comment period closed on September 7, 1993. No comments were received during the comment period,
and no one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearing so no hearing was held.


V. Director's Decision


Based on the above findings, and except as noted below, the Director is approving Indiana's proposed amendment 93-5
as submitted by Indiana on July 2, 1993. As discussed in Finding B-3, the Director is approving 310 IAC 12-0.5-139(b)
except to the extent that the proposed language is silent concerning the applicability of State statutory law. In
addition, the Director is requiring that Indiana further amend 310 IAC 12-0.5-139(b) to provide that
the interpretation of the terms of the document used to establish a valid existing right shall be based either upon
applicable State statutory or case law concerning interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights, or where
no applicable State statutory or common law exists, the interpretation is based upon the provisions at subdivisions
139(b)(1) and (2).
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are being amended to implement
this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process
and to encourage the State to conform its program with the Federal standards without delay. Consistency of State and
Federal standards is required by SMCRA.


Effect of Director's Decision


Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
his oversight of the Indiana program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Indiana of only such provisions.


Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence


Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate
to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.

) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.


VI. Procedural Determinations


Executive Order 12866


This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.


Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts
730, 731, and 732 have been met.


National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.

Bridge Worker Safety Rules 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT.


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final Rule; correction and petition for reconsideration.

 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 24, 1992, FRA published safety standards for the protection of those who work on railroad bridges (49 CFR Part
214). FRA now corrects certain sections of that regulation, and changes or clarifies certain requirements in response
to a petition for reconsideration filed by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). First, three sections have
been corrected by adding citations to reflect the most recent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards
for personal protective equipment. Second, the rule now sets forth conditions under which employees specially-designated
as bridge inspectors may work without fall protection. Third, the rule no longer requires toeboards on walkways,
and in certain instances permits work without fall protection on roadways attached to a railroad bridge. Finally,
FRA clarifies that railroads and their contractors must require the use of protective footwear, but need not necessarily
furnish it, which reflects current practice in the railroad, construction, and other industries where such equipment
is necessary. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On June 24, 1992, FRA published the Bridge Worker Safety Rules (57 FR 28116) that established requirements for the
protection of those railroad and railroad contractor employees who work on railroad bridges. The rule included provisions
for personal fall arrest systems, safety nets, personal protective equipment (head, face, eye, and foot equipment),
contingencies for working adjacent to water, and standards for walkways, railings, and scaffolds. The regulations
went into effect on September 24, 1992. However, in order to provide the industry additional time to obtain complying
equipment and adequately train workers, FRA suspended the effective date of the sections requiring fall protection
(

i.e.,

 sections 214.103 and 214.105) until November 24, 1992. (57 FR 45326.) 



On August 10, 1992, the AAR filed a petition seeking reconsideration (petition) of the bridge worker safety rules.
In that petition, the AAR sought reconsideration of 49 CFR 214.101(d), 214.103(b), and 214.103(c). After careful
consideration and for the reasons set forth below, FRA denied the AAR's request with respect to section 214.101(d),
partially granted the request with respect to section 214.103(b), and granted the request with respect to section
214.103(c). (FRA formally responded to the petition by letter to the AAR dated January 11, 1993, a copy of which is in
the docket of this matter.) 

The AAR petition first suggests that section 214.101(d) violates the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988 (RSIA) and
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and therefore should be withdrawn. Section 214.101(d) states that ``[A]ny
working conditions involving the protection of railroad employees working on railroad bridges not within the subject
matter addressed by this Chapter'' shall be governed by the regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA). This section is merely a restatement of the law as it stands with respect to occupational safety and health
matters in the railroad environment, and was added to the final rule in order to alleviate the jurisdictional confusion
expressed by rail labor and management prior to promulgation of the rule. FRA has explained the complementary jurisdiction
it shares with OSHA with respect to health and safety matters in the railroad industry in its Statement of Policy (Policy
Statement) (43 FR 10583) published in 1978, more recently in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (56 FR 3434)
in this proceeding, and on numerous other occasions. However, a discussion of the statutory jurisdiction each agency
possesses and the exercise of that authority is necessary to explain the basis for FRA's response to this aspect of
the AAR's petition.

The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) vests OSHA with responsibility for promulgating and enforcing workplace
safety and health standards. However, in recognition that other Federal agencies possess parallel, industry-specific
authority over occupational safety and health, section 4(b)(1) provides that no OSHA rules 






shall apply to working conditions of employees with respect to which other Federal agencies . . . exercise statutory
authority to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting occupational safety or health. 






29 U.S.C.  653(b)(1). The exercise of authority contemplated by this provision is one that results in a Federal
regulation for 
on-the-job protection of worker safety or health or a determination that a particular form of regulation is not appropriate.




The Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (``FRSA'') grants FRA broad authority to prescribe standards in ``all areas
of railroad safety.'' 45 U.S.C.  431(a). Pursuant to that authority, in 1975, FRA published an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking indicating its intention to develop its own set of occupational safety and health standards
that would, 

in toto,

 displace OSHA's regulatory program. 40 FR 10693 (March 7, 1975). After consideration of the record developed, however,
FRA reduced the scope of its efforts. 


In 1976, FRA published in that docket a notice of proposed rulemaking stating its intention to issue specific occupational
safety and health standards on only three subjects for railroad employees (egress from structures, general environmental
controls, and fire protection) that would displace otherwise applicable OSHA standards. 41 FR 29153 (July 15, 1976).
FRA also indicated its intention to incrementally issue a comprehensive code of such standards for railroad employees
that would gradually displace OSHA standards. FRA contemplated that these FRA standards would apply on a territorial
instead of a hazard-specific basis. 

In 1978, FRA sharply changed course: it terminated the regulatory proceeding and issued a Policy Statement instead
of pursuing a comprehensive code of FRA occupational safety and health standards. 43 FR 10583 (March 14, 1978). In
explaining its action, FRA stated: 





* * * Written comments in response to [the 1976] proposal were received, and a public hearing was conducted.
The FRA has reviewed not only these comments, but also the entire original concept as to the adoption of a comprehensive
code of occupational safety and health standards for the railroad industry paralleling the existing OSHA regulations.




* * * * *



* * * [G]iven the present staffing level for field investigation and inspection, the FRA has determined
that, at this time, it would not be in the best interests of the public and of railroad safety for this agency to become
involved extensively in the promulgation and enforcement of a complex regulatory scheme covering in minute detail
as do the OSHA standards, working conditions which, although located within the railroad industry, are in fact similar
to those of any industrial workplace. Rather, we believe that the proper role for FRA in the area of occupational safety
in the immediate future is one that will concentrate our limited resources in addressing hazardous working conditions
in those traditional areas of railroad operations in which we have special competence. 









Id. 

at 10584-85. 



Thus, contrary to its original intent, FRA's determination in 1978 was generally to leave OSHA standards in place
in the railroad industry. 

The Policy Statement defined ``railroad operations'' as the ``movement of equipment over rails'' (

Id.

), and rejected a ``territorial'' approach to delineating those working conditions over which FRA would exercise
its jurisdiction from those that would remain under OSHA's control. 

Id.

 at 10587. FRA did not want to duplicate capabilities ``already possessed by OSHA'' and stated: 






FRA recognizes that OSHA is not precluded 
from exercising jurisdiction with respect to 
conditions not rooted in railroad operations nor so 
closely related to railroad operations as to require 
regulation by FRA in the interest of controlling 
predominant operational hazards. 







Id. 

Therefore, until FRA exercises its statutory authority with respect to given working conditions through promulgation
of a standard or through an expression that regulation is unnecessary or would be counterproductive, existing OSHA
standards apply in the railroad workplace.

In support of its claim to withdraw section 214.101(d), the AAR alleges that because section 19 of the RSIA requires
FRA to issue rules, as necessary, for the protection of maintenance-of-way employees on railroad bridges, FRA is
the exclusive Federal agency to regulate this subject matter. Also, the AAR states that FRA does not have the discretion
``to delegate to OSHA a portion of its responsibility to regulate bridge worker safety.'' FRA has not delegated any
authority to OSHA through publication of section 214.101(d); characterizing section 214.101(d) as a delegation
is simply a misstatement of FRA's relationship with OSHA and OSHA's existing authority to regulate occupational
safety and health matters in every American workplace. Rather, FRA has purposefully chosen not to exercise its authority
over certain working conditions that OSHA also has the authority to regulate, and over which OSHA has comprehensively
exercised its authority. 

The AAR also argues that FRA violated the APA by not seeking public comment on section 214.101(d), and that this section
represents ``a radical departure'' from the NPRM and long-standing policy. On the contrary, this section accurately
reflects an extensive discussion in the preamble of the NPRM and its inclusion in the rule text is in direct response
to written comments submitted to the docket during the rulemaking. Clearly, those commenters knew the matter was
at issue. Notice and comment would be required if section 214.101(d) represented a new regulatory scheme for the enforcement
of occupational safety and health standards in the railroad workplace. Clearly, that is not the case. Section 214.101(d)
is a statement of FRA's interpretation of the law and is wholly consistent with FRA's previous interpretive statements.


From as long ago as publication of the Policy Statement in 1978, FRA has stated that it will exercise authority over
working conditions intrinsic to or closely related to railroad operations requiring FRA's unique expertise, and
has exercised its authority in some of those areas. All other occupational safety and health matters continue to be
governed by OSHA where that agency has exercised its authority over a specific working condition. The AAR concludes
that the Policy Statement makes ``the regulation of areas along railroad operating rights-of-way * * *
exclusively the province of FRA.'' This conclusion is incorrect, as it embodies the very ``territorial'' approach
to jurisdiction FRA rejected in 1978. The AAR chooses to misconstrue the functional distinction drawn by the Policy
Statement as a territorial division of jurisdiction (``fixed facilities such as offices and shops'' as OSHA's versus
``areas along railroad operating rights-of-way'' as FRA's), which it explicitly is not. For instance, as the NPRM
in this proceeding clearly states (56 FR 3435), the Policy Statement divested OSHA of authority to regulate the 

surfaces

 on railroad bridges, such as track and signal structures, but did not oust OSHA entirely from regulating any working
condition that arises on a railroad bridge, as the AAR argues. Also, the plain language of the Policy Statement left
the regulation of personal protective equipment with OSHA until FRA chose to exercise its authority in that regard.
43 FR 10583, 10588 (March 14, 1978). 

In promulgating the initial final rule, FRA methodically considered the hazards bridge work poses; exercised its
authority to regulate the use of certain personal protective equipment; and left other working conditions (for instance,
exposure to airborne toxins and attendant respirator use) under existing applicable OSHA standards. The areas left
to OSHA are those in which FRA neither has, nor can quickly acquire, the expertise necessary for effective implementation
of relevant standards. Were FRA to include such matters within its rule without the ability to enforce the relevant
standards, it would, as a practical matter, be creating a gap in the protection of railroad workers, which it does not
want to do. Moreover, but for respiratory protection, which FRA proposed to include in its rule but ultimately decided
to leave to OSHA, FRA never even proposed standards on the matters section 214.101(d) specifies as being included
within the areas left to OSHA (

i.e.,

 hazard communications, hearing protection, welding and lead exposure standards). 

Section 214.101(d) merely states the relationship between FRA's substantive standards and OSHA's; it does not impose
a new substantive burden. Whatever substantive burdens OSHA's rules place on railroads are the result of OSHA's exercise
of its authority prior to issuance of FRA's rule. This section only attempts to clarify which of those pre-existing
standards still apply even after the issuance of FRA's final rule, which displaces some of them. Section 214.101(d)
imposes no new substantive burdens and, accordingly, notice and comment was not necessary prior to issuance of this
essentially interpretive rule. 

Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the NPRM invited comment on where the jurisdictional lines should be drawn
and demonstrated FRA's intent to clarify it. FRA stated:




Thus, one question is whether the occupational safety issues presented by work on railroad bridges are so inherent
to the railroad environment that FRA alone should regulate them, or whether they cut across industry lines without
raising special concerns in the railroad context and thus are properly addressed by general OSHA standards.




56 FR 3434. FRA noted that there was considerable confusion about which OSHA standards applied and that it had placed
in the docket various legal memoranda from railroads and railroad associations on this issue. FRA then stated: ``[T]he
appropriate federal standards for personal protection, and the identity of the agency responsible for their enforcement,
must be crystal clear.'' 56 FR 3435. No participant in the rulemaking can be heard to complain about FRA's having provided
the clarification it promised. Therefore, although notice of this interpretive rule was not required, it was effectively
provided.

Section 214.101(d) does not reverse long-standing policy or law, does not violate the RSIA or APA and, therefore,
will not be withdrawn. 

Second, the AAR's petition asserts that the exemption in section 214.103(b) for instances where the installation
of fall protection poses a greater risk than working without protection should be expanded to include instances where
the installation and use of fall protection poses a greater risk. FRA does not believe there are compelling reasons
to enlarge this exception to the fall protection requirement with respect to all railroad bridge workers. The examples
cited by the AAR in their petition (fire fighting, re-railing cars, working with moving equipment) as instances where
the use of fall protection equipment may pose a greater risk than completing the work without fall protection are not
persuasive. FRA believes that for each of these situations installation of fall protection equipment is the most
difficult part of the process, and that once installed does not interfere in the work to be done. In other words, if installation
can be accomplished, the duties to be performed once protection is in place can also be accomplished. The AAR states
that workers need to be able to move away from these hazards quickly and easily. However, once installed, safety nets,
walkways, and fall arrest systems provide ample freedom of movement. The only fall protection device that may present
questions in this regard is the personal fall arrest system, and given new designs that encompass the peculiarities
of railroad bridge structures and points of attachment, these devices can be installed to allow prompt and careful
movement. Therefore, FRA is not willing to expand the fall protection exception set out in section 214.103(b) for
all bridge workers. However, FRA does believe that this exception should be broadened to permit railroad bridge inspectors
to work without installing or using fall protection systems, so long as certain criteria are met. 

Employees performing inspections of railroad bridges must climb to all points above and below the bridge deck, as
well as along the deck, and must be free to reach points on the structure that are accessed infrequently and with difficulty,
and then only for inspection purposes. FRA believes that in some instances the use of fall protection could heighten
the chance of injury for the inspector. Also, a blanket fall protection requirement could result in incomplete bridge
inspections, a fact that raises additional safety concerns for fellow employees and the public. Therefore, persons
who are capable of climbing on bridges, and who have been specifically qualified and designated by the railroad or
railroad contractor, may perform bridge inspections without the installation and use of fall protection required
under this regulation, provided the conditions set forth below are met. 

In order to qualify for the installation and use exception now set forth in section 214.103(b)(2), the railroad or
contractor using the exception must have a comprehensive written program in place that addresses pertinent climbing
techniques and applicable safety equipment. The employee to whom the exception applies must be trained and qualified
according to that program to conduct bridge inspections. Also, this employee must be formally designated by the railroad
or contractor as one who will perform bridge inspections and voluntarily accepts the designation. The reason for
this requirement is to prevent an employer from maintaining an informal bridge inspection program typified by on-the-spot
designations of employees who lack training and who are uncomfortable working at heights without protection. Section
214.103(b)(2)(D) requires that the employee must actually be engaged in the inspection of the bridge or its components
while the exception applies. Should this employee move to another duty on the bridge, fall protection would be required.
Finally, the employee to whom the exception applies must be familiar with the appropriate climbing technique needed
to scale safely the structure involved, and must be provided any generic, alternative or specialized equipment needed
to complete the climb efficiently and safely. For instance, some railroads are training their bridge inspectors
in rock climbing techniques and systems. If rock climbing techniques are used by a bridge inspector during the inspection,
the appropriate equipment must also be provided. 

The AAR also requests that FRA eliminate the requirement of toeboards on bridge walkways found in section 214.103(c).
In support of its request, the AAR states that toeboards are not normally found on railroad bridges, and because they
would permit snow, ice, and debris to accumulate on walkways, will present tripping or falling hazards. FRA agrees,
and is removing the toeboard requirement from section 214.103(c). Therefore, fall protection will no longer be required
where a bridge is equipped with secure walkways and railings that meet the remaining criteria set forth in section
214.103(c). Toeboards are used traditionally as a method to prevent tools from falling rather than as a fall protection
device. Recognizing that falling tools present hazards to those who work at levels below the walkway, FRA believes
that the dangers created by the presence of toeboards exceed those associated with not requiring them. Also, nearly
all railroad bridges equipped with secure walkways and railings do not also possess toeboards. Therefore, the substitution
of walkways for personal fall arrest systems and safety nets permitted by section 214.103(c) as originally written
is largely unusable.

<TEXT>
 

FRA also makes a clarification with respect to walkways in section 214.103(c). Many railroad bridges now include
vehicular roadways replacing second or multiple railroad tracks that have been removed. For the purposes of this
rule, FRA views these roadways as walkways. These roadways are at least as stable as the typical walkway built beside
track on a railroad bridge, and footing and movement on these roadways is as secure as on a walkway or on the track portion
of the railroad bridge. Because of these safety factors, FRA believes that employees working or moving at least six
feet from the edge of such a roadway are not at risk of falling over the side of the bridge. Therefore, where employees
are six or more feet from the edge of a vehicle roadway, fall arrest systems, safety nets, railings and handrails are
not required. Section 214.103(c)(2) now permits work without fall protection on roadway bridges so long as employees
remain at least six feet from the edge of the roadway.

Also, FRA is clarifying the rule with respect to personal protective equipment. FRA has received questions from the
regulated community concerning the interplay of sections 214.111 and 214.115. To alleviate any confusion, section
214.111 has been clarified by stating that railroads and their contractors must require the use of protective footwear,
but need not necessarily furnish that equipment. As written, section 214.115 of the final rule clearly states that
employers must require workers to wear foot protection, but does not contain the requirement present in the other
personal protective equipment sections stating the ``employees shall be provided'' such equipment. Section 214.111,
which sets out personal protection standards generally, appears to contradict section 214.115 by stating that the
railroads and contractors ``must provide and require the use of'' the equipment required by Subpart B of the rule,
including footwear. That contradiction is now removed. The practical difference involved here, as in other industries,
is that footwear is a personal item that the employer cannot reasonably be required to retain in stock, while other
safety items are easily supplied with a store of backup units should they be required. Therefore, section 214.111
is amended to exclude protective footwear from the group of personal protective devices that the railroads and their
contractors must provide. This change reflects the status of protective footwear in the railroad, construction,
and other industries where the equipment is needed, reiterates FRA's original intent, and does not in any way interfere
with collective bargaining agreements that address who ultimately bears the expense for personal protective equipment.

Finally, FRA is correcting sections 214.113, 214.115, and 214.117 by replacing outdated ANSI references with the
most recent standards for head, foot, and eye and face protection. As noted by commenters to the NPRM, these new standards
were generally used in industry when the NPRM and final rule were published, but FRA erroneously printed outdated
standards.



Regulatory Impact



E.O. 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



This correction of the final rule has been evaluated in accordance with existing policies and procedures and is not
considered significant under Executive Order 12866 or under DOT policies and procedures. The minor technical changes
made in this amendment will not increase the costs or alter the benefits associated with this regulation to any measurable
degree.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires a review of rules to assess their impact on small entities. This amendment to the final rule removes a requirement
originally placed on railroads and their contractors and clarifies an existing requirement. The changes will have
no new direct or indirect economic impact on small units of government, businesses, or other organizations. Therefore,
it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.



Paperwork Reduction Act



There are no paperwork requirements associated with this amendment of the final rule.



Environmental Impact



FRA has evaluated this amendment in accordance with its procedures for ensuring full consideration of the environmental
impact of FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and DOT Order 5610.1c. The amendment meets criteria establishing
this as a nonmajor action for environmental purposes.

Federalism Implications



This amendment will not have a substantial effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted.

(b)(1) This section shall not apply if the installation of the fall arrest system poses a greater exposure to risk than
the work to be performed. In any action brought by FRA to enforce the fall protection requirements, the railroad or
railroad contractor shall have the burden of proving that the installation of such device poses greater exposure
to risk than performance of the work itself.

(2) This section shall not apply to employees engaged in inspection of railroad bridges conducted in full compliance
with the following conditions:

(i) the railroad or railroad contractor has a written program in place that requires training in, adherence to, and
use of safe procedures associated with climbing techniques and procedures to be used;

(ii) the employee to whom this exception applies has been trained and qualified according to that program to perform
bridge inspections, has been previously and voluntarily designated to perform inspections under the provisions
of that program, and has accepted the designation;

(iii) the employee to whom this exception applies is familiar with the appropriate climbing techniques associated
with all bridge structures the employee is responsible for inspecting;

(iv) the employee to whom this exception applies is engaged solely in moving on or about the bridge or observing, measuring,
and recording the dimensions and condition of the bridge and its components; and

(v) the employee to whom this exception applies is provided all equipment necessary to meet the needs of safety, including
any specialized or alternative systems required.

(c) This section shall not apply where employees are working on a railroad bridge equipped with walkways and railings
of sufficient height, width, and strength to prevent a fall, provided that the employee does not work beyond the railings,
over the side of the bridge, on ladders or other elevation devices, or where gaps or holes exist through which a body
could fall. Where used in place of fall protection as provided for in  214.105, this paragraph (c) is satisfied
by:

(1) Walkways and railings meeting the standards set forth in the American Railway Engineering Association's Manual
for Railway Engineering; and

(2) Roadways attached to railroad bridges, provided that employees on the roadway deck work or move at a distance of
six feet or more from the edge of the roadway deck, or from an opening through which a person could fall.



* * * * *



3. By revising  214.111 to read as follows:



 214.111


Personal protective equipment, generally.



With the exception of foot protection, the railroad or railroad contractor shall provide and the employee shall use
all appropriate personal protective equipment described in this subpart in all operations where there is exposure
to hazardous conditions, or where this subpart indicates the need for using such equipment to reduce hazards to railroad
employees. The railroad or railroad contractor shall require the use of foot protection when the potential for foot
injury exists.

I. Introduction


1. By this 

Report and Order,

 the Commission adopts rules to implement section 9 of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 159, providing
for the annual assessment and collection of regulatory fees by the Commission.
 The 

Report and Order

 establishes the amounts of the regulatory fees for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 and the rules for the payment of such fees for
fiscal years 1994 and thereafter.
 Also, we are amending several of the rules governing the collection of the fees to be filed with applications and other
filings pursuant to section 8 of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 158.







2. The rules we adopt below are designed to ensure that (1) collection of fees does not adversely affect the Commission's
regulatory activities, (2) the most effective means possible are employed in the collection and deposit of fees,
and (3) the paperwork (and financial burden) on the public resulting from our collection process is kept to an absolute
minimum. The accomplish this goal, we have, to the extent possible, modeled our regulatory fee rules upon the rules
that we previously established to govern the collection of fees filed with applications and other filings. See 47
CFR 1.1101 

et seq.

 Moreover, in the course of fashioning rules to govern regulatory fees, we have revised several rules in order to improve
the collection process related to these fees and, wherever possible, to ease the burden on those entities subject
to the payment of these fees. Implementation of rules governing the collection of regulatory fees also furthers the
National Performance Review goals of reinventing government by requiring beneficiaries of the Commission's services
to pay the costs associated with these activities.


II. Background


3. Section 9(a) of the Communications Act requires the Commission to collect regulatory fees to recover the annual
cost of its enforcement activities, policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international
activities. 47 U.S.C. 159(a). 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(A). The Schedule of Regulatory Charges sets forth in section 9(g)
the categories of regulated entities subject initially to the regulatory fee requirement and designates the fees
to be collected for each subject category of regulatee. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). The Schedule of Fees sets forth annual regulatory
fees for specific categories of regulatees in Private Radio, Mass Media, Common Carrier and Cable Services.





4. Section 9(f)(1) requires the Commission to adopt rules to implement the assessment and collection of the annual
regulatory fees. 47 U.S.C. 159(f)(1). On March 4, 1994, we adopted a 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 (``

NPRM

'') to implement section 9 of the Act.
 In the 

NPRM,

 we concluded that Congress intended the Commission to rely upon the Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted in section
9(g) to recover costs for FY 1994.




5. In addition, the 

NPRM

 proposed rules providing for: (1) Exemptions from the regulatory fee requirements for governmental entities, nonprofit
entities, amateur licensees, noncommercial educational broadcasters, and licensees in the public safety services,
(2) standards for waiver, reduction and deferment of regulatory fees, (3) procedures for the payment of regulatory
fees, including the timing and method of payments, and the location for submission of payments, and (4) procedures
to assure timely payment of regulatory fees, including announcements in the 

Federal Register

 of the filing times for the fee payments, and penalties for late payment and nonpayment of fees.


III. Discussion


A. Assessment of Regulatory Fees for FY 1994


6. The 

NPRM

 proposed that for FY 1994, the Commission would utilize the Schedule of Regulatory Fees established by Congress in
section 9(g) of the Act. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). In response to this proposal, several commenters suggest that we amend the
Schedule of Fees for FY 1994. They contend that fees in the Schedule are too high, that the schedule provides the wrong
mechanism for assessing fees, and that additional services should be included in the fee schedule.

7. In particular, Fireweed Communications Corp.
 (Fireweed) argues that the regulatory fees impose an unfair and confiscatory financial burden on broadcast stations
in small markets, and impinge on the constitutional right of freedom of speech of Fireweed and its listeners. Fireweed
contends that the financial burden imposed by the regulatory fee would cause it to reduce its programming or even to
cease its operations. The Joint Commenters, consisting of several cable television interests,
 argue that we have authority to modify the Fee Schedule for FY 1994, to add classes of services that Congress did not
include in section 9(g)'s fee schedule. In addition, the Joint Commenters assert that the Commission is authorized
to modify the fee schedule for FY 1994 because section 9(b)(3), which governs permissive adjustments to the fee schedule,
including addition of services to the schedule, does not restrict our authority for making changes to fiscal years
after 1994. In particular, the Joint Commenters contend that Direct Broadcast Satellite, if available later this
fiscal year, Instructional Television Fixed Service, if used for commercial purposes, and Multi-channel Multipoint
Distribution Services, because it is not expressly enumerated as a service subject to the fee requirement, should
be added to the fee schedule and assessed a fee for FY 1994. The Joint Commenters also assert that adopting a fee requirement
for these services in this proceeding will avoid the necessity for immediately initiating a new rulemaking to include
these services in the fee schedule for FY 1995 and thereafter.







8. Other parties including Sprint, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association (CTIA), Comsat, and the Utilities
Telecommunications Counsel (UTC), support our conclusion in the 

NPRM 

that Congress intended that the Schedule set forth in section 9(g) would govern the assessment and collection of fees
for FY 1994. UTC states that Congress' inclusion in section 9(g) of the fee schedule, as well as other language in the
Act, clearly demonstrates that Congress did not intend that the Commission revise the fee schedule so soon after its
enactment.

9. We are not persuaded by the arguments urging a reduction in the statutory fees or amendment of the service categories
subject to the regulatory fees. In the 

NPRM, 

we concluded that Congress did not intend that we change the amounts or the services established by the statutory fee
schedule for 1994. Our conclusion is supported by the Conference Report, which states that we have authority to review
and adjust the fees after one year.
 Congress also enacted the fee schedule after reviewing information that we provided concerning the services subject
to the fees. We do not believe that Congress would have enacted section 9(g) intending that we immediately amend the
service classifications or fee amounts in its schedule.






10. In addition, other provisions of section 9 support our interpretation. Section 9(i) requires that, before making
adjustments to the services included in the fee schedule, we must develop accounting systems and provide an opportunity
for public comments on proposed cost allocations. 

NPRM 

para. 9. Section 9(b)(4)(B) requires that any amendment to the services contained in the statutory fee schedule not
be effective until 90 days after Congress is notified of those revisions. See 47 U.S.C. 159. As a practical matter,
the Commission could not possibly meet these requirements in time to permit section 9 fee collections in FY 1994. Given
these statutory requirements, we conclude that Congress did not intend that we make any changes to the services subjected
to the regulatory fee requirement or the amounts contained in the schedule for FY94.

11. Also, we do not agree with Joint Commenters that this is the appropriate proceeding to amend the Schedule of Fees
for future years. Such amendments would be premature because we do not now have the information necessary to establish
regulatory fees for FY 1995. As we stated in the 

NPRM

, we intend to commence a separate proceeding in connection with the assessment of fees for FY 1995. We will seek in that
proceeding comment concerning the allocation of costs of our enforcement, policy and rulemaking, information services,
and international services, including any necessary adjustments to the classes of services set forth in section
9(g)'s fee schedule. See 47 U.S.C.  159(i). 


12. Therefore, as we proposed in the 

NPRM

, in order to meet the congressional directive to implement the collection of regulatory fees in Fiscal Year 1994,
we are adopting without modification the Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted by Congress in section 9(g). See 47 U.S.C.
159(b)(1)(C). The Schedule provides a listing of the specific categories of regulatees in the Private Radio, Mass
Media, Common Carrier and Cable services that are required to pay a regulatory fee. We have incorporated the schedule
into our rules and we have established separate sections of the rules to provide the payment schedules for the Private
Radio Services ( 1.1152), Mass Media Services ( 1.1153), Common Carrier Services ( 1.1154) and
Cable Services ( 1.1155). In Appendix A of this 

Report and Order,

 we have included guidelines for the payment of fees for each service subject to the regulatory fee requirement. 



B. Exemptions From Regulatory Fees



13. In the 

NPRM

, we proposed to exempt certain discrete categories of regulatees from the requirement of file annual regulatory
fees. Section 9(h) explicitly provides and exemption from the fees for governmental entities, nonprofit entities
and amateur radio licensees. 47 U.S.C. 159(h). We concluded that Congress also intended to exempt all public safety
licensees and noncommercial educational broadcasters from the regulatory fee requirements. In the paragraphs
below, we review each of these categories and consider the comments that address each exemption.



1. Governmental Entities 



14. As provided in section 9(h) and proposed in the 

NPRM

, governmental entities will exempt from the regulatory fee requirement. As proposed, our rule implementing the
governmental exemption will conform to existing  1.1112(f) of the rules, which provides an exemption for governmental
entities from the fee requirements for applications and other filing fees. See 47 CFR 1.1112(f); see 

also 

47 U.S.C. 158(d)(1) (A), (B). Section 1.1112(f) broadly defines the term ``governmental entity'' to include ``any
state, possession, city, county, town, village, municipal corporation or similar political organization or subpart
controlled by publicly elected officials exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities
or programs.'' The comments generally support our proposals with regard to the exemption for governmental entities.


15. Cellular Communications of Puerto Rico (CCPR) contends that we should limit the government exemption so that
only usual and customary governmental functions would be exempt. In particular, CCPR argues that the Puerto Rico
Telephone Company (PRTC) which is controlled by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and operates a cellular telephone
system, should be required to pay a regulatory fee to the extent that it engages in for profit or competitive operations.
Further, CCPR argues that exempting PRTC from the regulatory fees for cellular telephone systems would give PRTC
an unfair competitive advantage. In opposition, PRTC argues that Congress did not distinguish between different
activities, and that as a result all of its operations are subject to the governmental exemption.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

16. The governmental exemption is mandated by Congress. Congress did not distinguish between various governmental
functions, nor did it restrict the exemption's availability for any specific governmental entities. Therefore,
we do not accept CCPR's proposal.



2. Nonprofit Entities


17. Section 9(h) also exempts nonprofit entities from the requirement to file regulatory fees. In the NPRM, we tentatively
found that Congress intended its exemption for nonprofit entities to cover any entity possessing nonprofit, tax
exempt status pursuant to section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 501. Congress' exemption of nonprofit
entities from regulatory fees is substantially broader than the limited exemption from the payment of application
filing fees that Congress afforded in section 8(d)(1) to nonprofit entities licensed in the Public Safety Radio Services
and tax exempt under section 501(c)(3). See 47 U.S.C. 158(d)(1); see also 47 CFR 1.1112(b). The comments generally
support our interpretation of the exemption, and we will adopt the exemption as proposed in the 

NPRM

. The nonprofit exemption will be available only to those licensees who have established their nonprofit status under
section 501.


3. Amateur Licensees


18. Pursuant to section 9(h), we proposed to establish an exemption from regulatory fees for amateur radio operators
licensed under part 97 of our rules. However, Congress included in the Schedule of Fees an annual regulatory fee covering
vanity call signs, and we proposed to establish a fee for amateur vanity call signs. We proposed that this fee would
be assessed if our proposed rules to establish vanity call signs become effective. See 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

, 9 FCC Rd 105 (1993).
19. We will adopt the exemption for amateur licensees as set forth in 

NPRM

. If our proposal to issue vanity calls signs is adopted, we will also assess a regulatory fee in FY 1994 upon persons
filing applications, pursuant to the charges listed in Congress' fee schedule.





4. Noncommercial Educational Broadcasters


20. In the NPRM, we concluded that regulatory fees are not applicable to noncommercial educational broadcasters.
Congress included commercial television and AM and FM radio broadcast licensees and permittees in its Schedule of
Fees. In contrast, Congress omitted the noncommercial educational stations from the category of stations subject
to the regulatory fee. In addition, and consistent with existing section 1.1112(d) of the rules governing application
fees, we proposed to exempt from the regulatory fee requirement any secondary and auxiliary broadcast services,
such as low power television (``LPTV'') stations, television translators and boosters, remote pickup stations
and intercity relay stations and other Mass Media, Common Carrier, and Private Radio facility authorizations used
with noncommercial radio, television and instructional services qualifying for the exemption. See 47 CFR 1.1112(d).
The comments supported the exemption for nonprofit educational broadcast stations and we will adopt the exemption
as set forth in the 

NPRM

.
21. Further, we affirm the tentative conclusion of the 

NPRM

 that noncommercial international short-wave will be subject to the regulatory fees. Congress did not provide an
express exemption for these stations and none of the commenters urged us to exempt the international short-wave stations.
In addition, unlike noncommercial LPTV and translator stations, the government does not provide financial support
to noncommercial international short wave stations through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) or the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Thus, the considerations that led us to conclude
that Congress intended to exempt noncommercial educational LPTV and translator stations are not present with respect
to international short-wave stations. See 

Fee Collection Program

, 6 FCC Rcd 5919, 5925 (1991).

5. Public Safety Services



22. We have received no comments opposing our proposal to exempt all licensees in the Special Emergency Radio and Public
Safety Radio services from regulatory fees even where the licensee does not qualify for an exemption as a governmental
or nonprofit entity. In the 

NPRM,

 we noted that the legislative history states that Congress intended to exempt public safety licensees from regulatory
fees. APCO, in supporting our proposal, urges that we limit the public safety exemption to entities eligible for Public
Safety Radio Service licenses pursuant to the provisions of part 90, subpart B, and not exempt licensees merely because
they are authorized to operate on a public safety channel. We agree with APCO that only entities eligible to operate
as public safety licensees should be entitled to an exemption. Therefore, we will restrict the public safety exemption
to entities eligible to operate in the Special Emergency Radio or Public Safety Radio Services.
 Under this definition, the fact that a licensee is authorized to use a frequency allocated to these services is insufficient
to gain an exemption as a public safety entity.





6. Certification of Exempt Status



23. In order to implement our congressional mandate concerning exemptions, the 

NPRM

 asked the parties to comment on the appropriate method for establishing exemptions from regulatory fees. Our goal
is to minimize the burden on applicants and licensees seeking exemption from the regulatory fees. See 

NPRM

 at   13, 16, and 21. The commenters supported our efforts and urged reporting and exemption certifications
designed to minimize their paperwork burdens.

24. Forest Industries Telecommunications (FIT) proposed that the Commission allow nonprofit entities to establish
their exempt status by submitting a Determination Letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that
the applicant has qualified for tax exempt status under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Act. The Utilities Telecommunications
Council (UTC) urges that we reduce the burden on entities seeking to obtain a nonprofit exemption by requiring only
that they file their employer identification numbers (EINs). UCC asserts that EINs are sufficient to permit verification
of an entity's nonprofit status. The National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA) urges that we also exempt
entities that have applied for IRS Determination Letters so that IRS administrative delays do not result in the denial
of exemption from the regulatory fee requirement. NTCA requests that our determination of nonprofit status remain
effective until a change in such status is determined by the IRS.

25. PRTC urges us to rely upon existing exemptions from application fee payments held by governmental entities rather
than require these entities to provide additional certifications to obtain exemptions from the regulatory fee requirement.
Similarly, UCC contends that no additional certification of exempt status should be required from governmental
applicants in the Private Radio services since applications for these services require information disclosing
their exempt status.

26. We agree with PRTC and UCC that we can rely on the data in private radio service applications and in the Commission's
files to determine a regulatee's exempt status. Further, licensees and other regulatees for whom we have such data
will not be required to file documentation to support their exempt status. If, after reviewing the information already
on file, we are unable to determine a regulatee's exempt status we will issue a request that an applicant or licensee
further document its claim of exempt status. With respect to amateur, noncommercial educational broadcast stations
and public safety licensees, we do not anticipate any problem in establishing their eligibility for exempt status
because their exempt status is based on the nature of their licenses.

27. When our records contain no evidence of a governmental entity's exempt status, we will accept a certification
of its governmental status. Nonprofit licensees may submit section 501 Determination Letters. Because these documents
are readily available in the files of nonprofit entities, we decline at this time to establish a mechanism to verify
nonprofit status through EINs. We will also require that an entity with a pending request for an IRS Determination
Letter submit a regulatory fee because the IRS may deny the request for tax exempt status. However, we will refund the
fee for the period covered by a subsequently issued Determination Letter.






28. We caution that we expect regulatees to act in good faith. In any instance in which payment is overdue, and the licensee
or permittee cannot establish its entitlement to an exemption, we will assess a 25 percent penalty for late payment
as authorized by Congress.



C. Waivers, Reductions and Deferments



29. Section 9(d) provides that ``[t]he Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance
for good cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(d). Section 9(d) is similar
to, if not identical with section 8(d)(2) of the Act related to waivers and deferments of application fees. 47 U.S.C.
158(d)(2). Pursuant to section 8(d)(2), we have permitted waivers only on a case-by-case basis following a demonstration
that the public interest clearly overrides the private interest of the requester. Thus, in our 

NPRM,

 we proposed to restrict similarly waivers to encompass only those requests unambiguously articulating ``extraordinary
and compelling circumstances'' outweighing the public interest in recouping the cost of the Commission's regulatory
services from a particular regulatee.

30. For those entities required to file regulatory fees with their applications, such as licensees in the private
radio service, we proposed procedures for filing waiver, deferral and reduction requests similar to those we have
fashioned for application fee waiver requests. See 47 CFR 1.1115(e). Persons seeking waiver or reduction of a regulatory
fee would submit the required fees and forms along with their requests for waiver or reduction. We noted that this procedure
assures efficient collection of necessary fees and avoids the possible imposition of a late fee in the event that the
licensee's request for waiver or reduction is denied. In the case of standard regulatory fees, we further proposed
that the required fee accompany any request for waiver or reduction. In either case, we proposed to return or modify
the tendered fee upon grant of the waiver or reduction request. Finally, we proposed that a request for deferred payment
of the required fee should be submitted 60 days in advance of the date established for the payment of the fee in order
to permit review and action prior to the fee's due date.

31. Several state broadcasting associations (State Broadcasters) in their joint comments, suggest that the public
interest would be served by granting permanent or temporary waivers or reduction or deferment of fees to Mass Media
licensees who can demonstrate that payment of the fees would impair their service to the public. The State Broadcasters
contend that our authority to waive, reduce or defer fee payments in such cases is clear if a showing is made that payment
of the fee would result in degradation of service to the public, citing 

NBC 

v. 

United States, 

319 U.S. 190 (1943); 

FCC 

v. 

Sanders Bros. Radio Station

, 309 U.S. 470 (1940). In order to demonstrate financial hardship, the State Broadcasters urge that they be allowed
to submit any relevant evidence, including tax records, unaudited balance sheets or any other financial statements.
Further, the State Broadcasters argue that the fee should be automatically waived if a Mass Media licensee is in bankruptcy,
receivership or trusteeship because this status is a clear signal of financial hardship.

32. The Broadcasters, joined by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), contend further that the requirement
to file the regulatory fee payment with a request for waiver is irrational where the basis for the waiver request is
the financial hardship of the licensee. Further, the NAB states that it will be impossible to dispose of waiver requests
before the fee payments are due for FY 1994 because of the short period between the completion of this proceeding and
the date for submission of fees. Moreover, the NAB stresses that Congress contemplated that there would be situations
where the financial burden imposed by the fee requirement would be so onerous that payment should be waived. According
to the NAB, if Congress' purpose in providing for waiver, reduction or deferment is to have any practical effect, according
to NAB, we should not require applicants requesting waivers for financial hardship to suffer additional financial
burden that they cannot afford.

33. We are not persuaded that we should modify our proposal to generally require the filing of the regulatory fee with
each waiver or reduction request. Rather, we continue to believe that our current procedure will help ensure efficient
collections.

34. Nevertheless, we recognize that there may be exceptional instances in which requiring payment of the regulatory
fee along with a waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community or other financial
hardship to the licensee or other regulatee. In those instances, the licensee should submit, together with its waiver
request, a petition to defer payment until the waiver request is resolved. In order to reduce the burden on regulatees,
we will accept petitions for waiver, reduction and deferment so long as they are filed no later than by the date payment
is due. The filing of the deferment request will toll the requirement to pay the regulatory fee until disposition of
the deferment request.






35. Petitioners seeking a waiver, deferral or reduction of a regulatory fee based upon financial hardship may submit
any relevant information in support of their request. We will review the supporting documents and base our ruling
upon the information submitted and any additional information available in our records. If a petitioner presents
a compelling case of financial hardship, no payment of the regulatory fee will be due. If the supporting materials
do not present sufficient evidence of hardship, we will deny the petition. If the fee has not already been submitted,
the petitioner will then have 30 days to file its regulatory fee in order to avoid the assessment of penalty charges
and the invocation of any other available remedy. The filing of a petition for reconsideration will not toll this 30-day
period.

1. Categories of Payors



36. Pursuant to section 9(f), we proposed to establish three classes of regulatory fee payments, standard, small
and large, based upon the size of the payment required by the Schedule. The time for submitting the fee would be determined
by the class of fee payment. Persons making ``large'' fee payments for Fiscal Year 1994 would be eligible to complete
their fee payment in two installments. Moreover, we stated that consideration would be given to allowing four installment
payments for Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter. We proposed, however, that small fee payments be remitted when an application
for a license of a facility subject to the fee is filed and the payment amount is the fee due for the entire term of the license
or other authorization. We proposed that regulatees subject to a standard fee are to submit the fee in a single, annual
payment. The specific date for the payment of a standard fee would be announced by public notice and published in the


Federal Register

 well before the payment's due date.






37. Brown and Schwaninger (B&S) states that Congress intended to establish only two, not three, categories of
regulatory fees_large fees and small fees_because section 9(f) enumerates only two such categories of fee payments.
B&S contends that Congress would have included in section 9 explicit authority to establish a third category
if it had intended to provide such authority. In the absence of any language in section 9 indicative of a third category,
B&S contend that we are precluded from adopting a standard fee category and collecting standard fees. Instead,
B&S reasons that our authority under section 9 is limited to determining that a particular fee is either large,
and establishing an installment plan, or the fee is small and collecting it in advance for a number of years not to exceed
the term of the license.
38. We reject B&S's interpretation of section 9(f). In section 9(a), the general authority provision, Congress
broadly empowered us ``to assess and collect regulatory fees. . . .'' Subsection 9(f) requires
only that our rules include specific provisions providing for advance payments in the case of small fees and installment
payments for larger ones. Nothing in that section, or in logic, compels a conclusion that every fee must necessarily
fall within a category of either ``large'' or ``small.'' Section 9(f) is simply silent regarding any other substantive
aspect of our fee collection system, including whether other categories of fee payments may be established. Moreover,
our conclusion that some regulatees are subject to payment of neither large nor small fees and, consequently, are
only subject to a single annual regulatory ``standard'' fee payment, in no way conflicts with Congress' directive
to include specific consideration of those payors of large and small fees. Therefore, we adopt our proposal to establish
three categories of regulatory fees.


2. Installment Payments



39. In the NPRM, we proposed that some fees would be classified as ``large'' fees and, therefore, eligible for payment
by installment. For FY 1994, we identified the following fee amounts in the specified categories as eligible for payment
on the installment plan.





40. Several parties urge that we expand significantly our proposed installment payment eligibility standards.
GTE and Sprint request that we establish an installment fee benchmark of $250,000 for all classes of services that
are not allowed to make installment payments under our proposal. The Broadcasting Association argues that all mass
media licensees should be eligible for installment payments and the New Jersey Broadcasting Association (New Jersey
Association) argues that all radio broadcasting licensees, or in the alternative, licensees encountering financial
hardship should be permitted to make installment payments. GE American Communications, Inc. contends that licensees
of satellite space stations should be afforded installment payment eligibility.

41. For FY 1994, we intend to permit installment payments by a reasonable number of regulatees whose fees greatly exceed
the average fee in a particular service category. Through this means we can ensure that we are able to structure a fee
collection system that can be fairly and efficiently administered, given our available resources and our relative
inexperience with the regulatory fee program and its installment component.






42. Since little time is left in which to collect fees for FY 1994, the practical impact of permitting licensees to make
installment payments this year should be minimal in any event. In these circumstances, we thus find it both fair and
prudent to decline to expand significantly installment payment eligibility for FY 1994. Also, we decline to permit
installment payments for radio licensees, since no fee greater than $900.00 is imposed on these licensees.

43. As we gain experience with the regulatory fee program and, in particular, with its installment payment component,
we will consider increasing eligibility to make installment payments. Therefore, with a limited exception, we will
adopt our proposed installment fee standards. As discussed above, if a licensee concludes that payment of a fee in
its entirety would constitute a financial hardship or if it cannot otherwise submit a full payment, the licensee may
submit a partial payment of the fee with a petition to defer payment of the remaining portion of the fee. Interested
parties may renew their arguments for increased installment opportunities in their comments concerning the assessment
and collection of regulatory fees for 1995.

44. Notwithstanding our decision not to expand significantly installment payment eligibility this year, we have
decided to permit space station and system licensees to submit their fees in installments. These licensees are relatively
few in number, and the uniform fee structure for this service does not lend itself to the mechanism we used to establish
installment payments in categories of services with progressive fee structures. Thus, we will permit licensees
of geosynchronous satellite space stations and low earth orbit satellite systems to file their fee payments in installments.

45. As proposed, regulatees qualifying for installment payments for FY 1994 may make their fee payments in two separate
and equally divided payments with the first payment due on the date set for paying standard annual fees. The date for
each installment will be announced by Public Notice and in the 

Federal Register

. For future fiscal years, we plan to permit four installments annually. We have decided not to impose an administrative
fee with each installment payment. However, any late filed installment payment will be subject to a 25 percent late
fee and the payment of interest for the delinquent amount. Further, any regulatee paying its fees by installment will
automatically lose its eligibility to pay by installments if it fails to make any of its payments in a timely fashion.



3. Advance Payments



46. FIT and UTC support our proposal to require that regulatory fee payments in the Private Radio services be made in
advance. We will require that full payment for Private Radio service regulatory fees due over the entire term of the
authorization be submitted at the time an applicant in the Private Radio service submits its new, renewal or reinstatement
application.
 For example, regulatees in the private, shared use services would submit a one time regulatory fee of $35.00 per license
to cover the entire five-year term of their license or authorization. Moreover until expiration of that authorization,
we will not subject regulatees submitting advance fee payments to submit another (supplementary) fee payment for
the same authorization until expiration of that authorization, notwithstanding any subsequent increase in the
applicable annual fee. In instances in which a license is transferred to another service and, therefore, becomes
subject to a different annual fee, as in the case of Private Radio licensees as they become Commercial Mobile Radio
Service licensees, we have generally decided to apply any advance payment to the new annual fee requirement resulting
from that reclassification. Thus, the licensee would become subject to payment of the difference between its initial
fee payment and the amount required under the fee schedule for its new service.





47. For FY 1994, no Mass Media or Common Carrier regulatory fees will be subject to collection as small fees. However,
in future years, we may decide to collect advance payments of fees in these services in the event that we conclude that
the fee required is small and our experience shows that it is inefficient to collect the fee on an annual basis.

4. Timing of Payment



48. As noted, the date for payment of standard fees will be announced by public notice and published in the 

Federal Register

. For licensees, permittees and holders of other authorizations in the Common Carrier, Mass Media and Cable Services
whose fees are not based on a subscriber, line or circuit count, fees should be submitted for any authorization held
as of October 1, 1993. We have selected October 1 as the date for calculating these fees since October 1 is the first day
of the fiscal year and, therefore, current licensees subject to the fees would have benefited from out regulatory
activities since the beginning of the period covered by their payment.






49. In the case of regulatees whose fee payments are based upon a subscriber, line or circuit count, we have decided
that the number of a regulatee's subscribers, lines or circuits on December 31, 1993 will be used to calculate the fee.
We have selected the last date of the calendar year because many of these entities file reports with us as of that date.
Others calculate their subscriber numbers as of the last day of the calendar year for internal purposes. Therefore,
calculation of the subscriber fee as of that date will facilitate both an entity's computation of its fee payment and
our verification that the correct fee payment has been submitted. Cable systems should calculate their FY 1994 regulatory
fees using the subscriber data that was provided to the Commission for the 1993 Annual Report of Cable Television Systems
(FCC Form 325A) submission. Accordingly, the number of subscribers will not necessarily be based on December 31,
1993, but rather on ``a typical day in the last full week of December 1993.'' (

See 

FCC Form 325 Instructions at page 1). Finally, since entities in the Private Radio services pay their fees when applying
for an new, renewal or reinstatement license, we will require Private Radio applicants to submit a regulatory fee
with new, renewal and reinstatement applications filed following the effective date of these rules.



5. Method and Location of Payment



50. We proposed to adopt generally the same methods of payment for regulatory fees as we established for application
fees. See 47 CFR 1.1108(a). In addition, we proposed to establish a process to permit the electronic filing of fee payments,
initially on an experimental basis. Further, we proposed to permit payment of fees by credit card (VISA and Mastercard)
in some circumstances subject to the requirement that, when a credit card payment is made, the entire fee payment must
be made in a single credit card transaction.

51. Several parties have requested clarification of our requirements for multiple fee payments by Private Radio
licensees.
 Other parties support our proposals concerning payment methods, particularly our decision to accept credit cards
and electronic payments.







52. We have designed FCC Forms 159 (Remittance Advice) and 159-C (Continuation sheet) to replace Form 155. We
are satisfied that the forms, and our rules, provide sufficient clarification of our requirements concerning multiple
fee payments. These forms are to be submitted with any regulatory fee payment in the mass media, common carrier and
cable services. Payors, in the Private Radio services making a single regulatory fee payment, other than by electronic
means or credit card, are not required to file a Form 159 as long as their accompanying application form provides the
information necessary to accomplish the payment.



6. Multiple Payments



53. Generally, we will permit any entity, including licensees in the private radio services, to make multiple section
9 regulatory (and section 8 application) fee payments within the same lockbox, including, where applicable, installment
payments. Under this procedure, a single payment form and a single instrument of payment may be used to cover multiple
regulatory fee payments.
 A multiple regulatory fee payment also may cover payments by more than a single regulatee. Regulatees making combined
payments of regulatory fees and application fees within the same lockbox for the Private Radio services may make payment
with a single payment instrument and are to submit with the multiple payment a Form 159 and, if needed, a Form 159-C.
Also, any regulatee making payment by credit card, including licensees in the private radio services, must submit
a Form 159. See the specific instructions concerning the use of Forms 159 and 159-C. A copy of the forms and instructions
may be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission, Forms Distribution Center, 2803 52d Avenue, Hyattsville,
MD 20781.





54. Each regulatee will remain solely responsible for assuring that its applications and authorizations are properly
accounted for and listed, and for submitting the full, cumulative payment covering each of its licenses and authorizations.
 As described below, payment deficiencies could lead to penalty charges, dismissal of applications and revocation
of authorizations. 





55. As proposed in our 

NPRM, 

we are establishing a single lockbox at our lockbox bank for the receipt of mass media, common carrier and cable regulatory
fees. The single lockbox will accept Mass Media, Common Carrier and Cable Services regulatory fee payments, and will
enable regulatees to submit fee payments for these services to the same lockbox and to combine their fee payments for
these service categories. However, Private Radio fees will not be accepted at this lockbox and, instead, should be
submitted to the lockbox designated for application fees covering the category of license or authorization for which
the payment is made. See sections 1.1152 through 1.1155 for the address, including lockbox number regarding payment
of regulatory fees for the specific categories of service.

7. Electronic Payments



56. We have decided to proceed cautiously with our implementation of electronic fee payments. We require that regulatees
intending to make fee payments electronically submit a written request to the Managing Director and obtain his written
authorization or that of his designee prior to making their initial electronic payment.
 Following authorization by the Office of the Managing Director, a payor may either instruct its bank to make payment
of a regulatory fee directly to our lockbox bank or authorize us to direct our lockbox bank to withdraw funds directly
from the payor's bank account. It is the responsibility of the entity subject to the regulatory fee payment to assure
compliance with our electronic payment procedures. We will announce specific procedures for electronic payment
by public notice. Failure to comply with these procedures will result in the return of the fee payment and a penalty
of 25 percent if the subsequent refiling of the payment is late. Any late payment resulting from a failure to comply
with our electronic fee payment procedures will also subject the payor to the penalties set forth in  1.1163
of the rules.





57. Credit card payments may be made only with Mastercard and Visa since at this time these are the only credit cards
authorized for payments to the United States Treasury. Credit card payments must be accompanied by a Form 159. Failure
to accurately enter an authorized signature and the credit card name, number and date of expiration in blocks 22 and
23 of Form 159 will result in the return of the credit card payment and any associated filing.



E. Enforcement



58. As provided in section 9(c) of the Act, we proposed to enforce payment of regulatory fees by: (1) Assessing monetary
penalties for late payment, (2) dismissal of applications and, (3) in egregious cases, revocation of existing licenses
and authorizations. 47 U.S.C. 159(c). In addition, we proposed to pursue delinquent regulatees under the Debt Collection
Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711 

et seq., 

and related statutory provisions.



1. Penalties for Late Payment



59. Any regulatee that fails timely to pay its regulatory fee or make an installment payment shall be assessed a 25 percent
penalty. See 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(1). A regulatory fee is untimely paid when it is not received at the lockbox bank by the
date we establish for payment.
 A fee payment is also considered late filed if an instrument of payment is not collectible. A 25 percent penalty will
be assessed against any outstanding amount due on a fee, including any amount past due on an installment payment.





2. Dismissal of Application


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00047 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

60. We will dismiss any application, group of applications or other filings in the private radio services when a regulatee
fails timely to submit any regulatory fee or associated penalty. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(2). A fee payment will be considered
to be late filed if a timely filed instrument of payment is uncollectible and the deficiency is not the result of bank
error.
 Thus, an application required to be submitted with a regulatory fee will be returned without action if the fee is not
filed with the application. Moreover, if the returned application is mutually exclusive and must be filed by a date
certain (or is required to be filed by a date certain for any other reason), the application will be dismissed as untimely
if resubmitted subsequent to the filing deadline.







3. Revocation



61. Section 9(c)(3) provides the Commission with authority to revoke an existing license or other authorization
for nonpayment of a regulatory fee. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(3). We proposed to reserve our revocation remedy for egregious
cases of nonpayment. Section (9)(c)(3) does not require a finding of ``willful or repeated'' failure to make payment
before a license or authorization may be revoked. Further, the section affords the right to a hearing only if a regulatee's
response to our notice of revocation presents a ``substantial and material question of fact.''

62. Consistent with the statutory framework for revocation, any revocation hearing will be resolved by written evidence
only and the burden of proceeding and the burden of proof will be on the respondent. As proposed, we will provide a period
of 60 days for a regulatee to respond to our notice of revocation in order to assure that the subject regulatee will have
a full opportunity to obtain the funds needed to make payment and to prepare its case. Further, we will assess the regulatee
for the costs for the conduct of any revocation proceeding unless the regulatee ``substantially'' prevails at the
hearing. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(3). Finally, pursuant to section 9(c)(3), an order of revocation will not become final
until the respondent regulatee has had an opportunity to exhaust its rights to judicial review under section 402(b)(5)
of the Act. 47 U.S.C. 402(b)(5).

63. MCI recognizes that we should use our authority to revoke licenses and assess penalties as tools to enforce payment
of fees. However, MCI urges that we restrict their use to cases where a licensee ``willfully'' has acted in bad faith
in not paying the required fee. MCI states that this is particularly important for licensees with large and complex
operations in services where licensing information currently is not included in our records since licensees with
numerous authorizations may have no other way to confirm existing licenses. In these instances, according to MCI,
we should attempt to resolve nonpayment issues informally since most fee payment disputes should be quickly and easily
resolved.

64. We agree with MCI that our revocation powers should not be lightly invoked. We stated in the NPRM that we would reserve
the right to revoke licenses held by a delinquent regulatee, but that we did not foresee the need for revocation, except
in egregious circumstances. We will not consider a failed payment to be egregious as long as the regulatee demonstrates
that its deficiency was not due to gross neglect in maintaining its records or in preparing to meet its obligation to
make the fee payments. However, we intend to automatically assess delinquent payors a 25 percent penalty for late
or missing payments, and such assessments will be strictly enforced.



4. Debt Collection Act Remedies



65. In addition to those specific remedies for nonpayment or untimely payment of regulatory fees provided in section
9, we will invoke our powers under the Debt Collection Act against any regulatee failing to pay a regulatory fee. See
31 U.S.C. 3711 

et seq.

 We will afford a regulatee a 30-day period to respond to our notice of delinquency before invoking the procedures provided
in the Debt Collection Act. Moreover, when necessary, we will refer outstanding debts of delinquent regulatees to
the Internal Revenue Service for offset. See 31 U.S.C. 3720A. Included in the recovery of any delinquent fee will be
an assessment of interest on the debt due, a penalty for nonpayment, and the allowable cost incurred due to the federal
government in the collection process. See 31 U.S.C. 3717.



IV. Regulatory Fee Categories



66. In our NPRM, we provided an explanation of the regulatory fee categories subject to the payment of a fee under the
schedule established by Congress. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). Where a regulatory fee category required additional interpretation
or clarification, we relied on the legislative history of section 9 and our experience in establishing and regulating
the various services. The categories and amounts set out in the schedule may, by the next fiscal year and in subsequent
fiscal years, be amended, adjusted, or modified to reflect changes in our appropriations, costs and changes in the
nature of our regulated services. See 447 U.S.C. 159(b) (2), (3).

67. Several parties have submitted comments regarding the regulatory fee categories. Generally, the comments addressed
issues concerning possible adjustment of the required fees, the absence of certain services from the fee schedule,
and definitions of terms important to payment of the fees. We address these comments below. In certain instances,
we have clarified our explanation of a fee category based upon the comments of the parties. See Appendix B.



A. Private Radio Services



68. The two basic levels of statutory fees allocated for Private Radio Services, exclusive use and shared use services,
were established on the premise that those licensees who generally receive a higher quality communications channel,
due to exclusive or lightly shared frequency assignments, will pay a higher fee than those who share channels of marginal
quality.
 

House Report

 at 17. In addition, because of the relatively small fee amounts levied in the Private Radio Services, as we proposed
in the Notice, applicants for new licenses, reinstatement and renewal licenses will be required to pay a regulatory
fee covering an entire license term. Applications for modification or assignment of an existing authorization do
not require payment of a regulatory fee since the expiration date of modified or assigned licenses will not reflect
a new license term.




1. Exclusive Use


69. B&S disputes our interpretation of the fee schedule's requirement for Private Radio Service fees. Essentially,
B&S contends that the term ``shared use services,'' as it appears in the Schedule of Regulatory Fees, applies
to systems that share use of their licensed facilities with others. According to B&S, an 800 MHz Specialized Mobile
Radio Service licensee providing service to end users is an example of a shared use service because the SMRs customers
are sharing the same base station facility. B&S argues that their analysis is consistent with 47 CFR 90.179 and
precedent interpreting that provision of our rules. According to B&S, it follows that ``exclusive use services''
are comprised of licensed facilities that are used only by the licensee. An example of what B&S considers an exclusive
use service is a licensee in the Taxicab Radio service that operates an internal communications system in the 470-512
MHz band.
70. B&S confuses the concept of shared use of a particular licensed facility with that of shared channel assignments.
Under 47 CFR 90.179, a licensee or group of licensees may choose to share base station facilities on a non-profit or
not-for-profit basis. In contrast, shared channel assignments require licensees to be licensed for the same channel
for the same geographic area, and it is this latter concept that the Schedule of regulatory fees clearly addresses.
As we have recently explained in our 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 in PR Docket No. 92-235,
 the private land mobile radio services licensed below 470 MHz
 do not enjoy exclusive use of their channel assignments in a particular geographic area, and must accept a greater
degree of co-channel interference.
 In contrast, channel assignments above 470 MHz, including the SMR service, are granted on either an exclusive basis,
with no other co-channel use authorized in a geographic area, or are licensed on an ``earned exclusivity'' basis,
where co-channel use is capped. Thus, licensees of services above 470 MHz enjoy a lesser degree of interference than
those below 470 MHz, and, accordingly, are required to pay the higher regulatory fee. To accept B&S's interpretation
would ignore the established demarcation point between ``shared'' and ``exclusive'' channel assignments that
470 MHz represents.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

71. RAM Mobile Data USA Limited Partnership (RMD) states that 900 MHz SMR licensees should be required to pay a fee based
upon their total number of licensed Designated Filing Areas (DFA) rather than their number of base station and frequencies
individually licensed with a DFA. RMD contends that an assessment based upon total DFAs licensed is more consistent
with Congress' intention that regulatory fees be ``reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the
fee by the Commission's activities.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(b)(1)(A). Further, RMD states that section 9(g)'s fee requirements
will compel a consolidation of its licenses in order to minimize its fee payments. Similarly, the Utilities Telecommunications
Council (UTC) objects to the requirement that 220 MHz licensees submit fees on a per license basis.
72. We decline to consider amending the section 9(g) fee schedule for FY 1994. As we have stated, Congress did not intend
that we adjust any aspect of the fee schedule for FY 1994. RMD and UTC may submit their proposals for amending the fee
schedule in our proceeding to establish regulatory fees for FY 1995.





Of course, RMD and any other licensee may surrender or modify their licenses and other authorizations in order to minimize
their regulatory fee burden.


2. Marine (Coast and Ship Stations)


73. Numerous formal and informal commenters, including the United States Coast Guard, raise concerns about our proposal
to collect a regulatory fee from licensees in the marine service, including licensees using radio equipment voluntarily
installed on small vessels, such as recreational boats.
 These parties contend that a waiver, or exemption, for vessels that voluntarily carry radio equipment would enhance
maritime safety and promote the public interest. As support, the parties state that marine radio provides a vital
link between recreational boaters and emergency safety entities, as well as an important source for weather and navigational
information. Further, they contend that the regulatory fee, added to the existing application fee, will act as a substantial
disincentive for recreational boaters to carry, maintain and operate marine communications equipment.




74. We recognize that radio communication between recreational boaters and various emergency safety entities provides
an important public service. However, our authority to waive a fee requirement is limited to ``narrow'' and ``compelling
circumstances.'' 2 FCC Rcd 947, 961 (1987); H.R. 3128, H.R. Rep. No. 453, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 39-42, 423 (1985).
In view of this strict Congressional limitation, we do not believe that a ``blanket waiver'' granted to boaters operating
marine radios is permissible, absent legislative amendment.


3. General Mobile Radio Service


75. The Personal Radio Steering Group (PRSG) requests that we lower the annual fee for licensees in the General Mobile
Radio Service (GMRS). PRSG states that, because the Schedule of Regulatory Fees does not explicitly include a fee
for GMRS, we have authority to reduce its fee. Moreover, PRSG contends that the service should be subject to a lower
fee than that for other shared use services because it is intended primarily for personal communications, similar
to the Amateur Radio Service.
76. We agree with PRSG that section 9(g)'s fee schedule contains no explicit terms regarding the GMRS. However, that
section does require the payment of a fee by ``shared use'' services in the private radio service. GMRS is within that
category of service and was explicitly mentioned in the House Report as a service that would be subject to a fee. Therefore,
we conclude that GMRS licensees are subject to a $7.00 fee for each year of the license term, payable in advance upon
the filing of a GMRS application. We decline to rule on the merits of PRSG's argument that its fees should be lowered
because, as discussed above, we conclude that Congress for FY 1994 intended us to assess fees in accordance with its
Schedule.


B. Mass Media Services


1. Broadcast Stations


77. The regulatory fees in the Schedule for Mass Media services generally include broadcast licensees, permittees
and other regulatees. As discussed above, we have exempted noncommercial educational broadcasters from regulatory
fees. To the extent possible, we intend to use the Bureau's computer data bases to verify the identity of regulatees
subject to regulatory fees in the Mass Media services.

78. Several commenters contend that the statutory fee schedule is unfair to certain categories of licensees in the
Mass Media services and complain that the schedule fails to impose a fee on other categories of regulatees. De La Hunt
Broadcasting Corporation and the Broadcasting Associations believe that radio broadcaster licensees should be
assessed regulatory fees on a market-size basis, in a manner similar to the fees mandated for television stations.
The NAB urges that we adjust the schedule for radio broadcast licensees when we consider appropriate fees for future
years. Further, the Broadcasting Associations contends that we should not include a television station as being
in a major market unless that station serves the metropolitan area of that particular market.

79. We decline to consider any adjustments to the schedule for FY 1994 for radio and television stations. As we explained
above, we believe that Congress did not intend that we adjust any aspect of the fee schedule it established for FY 1994.
Interested parties may submit comments, however, addressed to modifying the method for assessment of radio and television
broadcasting fees at the time we issue our proposed schedule of fees for FY 1995.



2. Television Stations



80. Section (9)(g) provides that the regulatory fee charged a television licensee will be determined by the size of
its market. We recognized in our 

NPRM

 that Arbitron no longer provides television rating information. However, no party has proposed that we rely on another
mechanism for determining market size. Therefore, we will utilize Arbitron's ADI rankings for 1993-1994 for
the determination of television markets for assessing our FY 1994 regulatory fees since it appears, at this time,
that these are the most familiar and readily available tools for determining the relative ranking of television markets.

81. KBS License L.P. (KBS) and the NAB argue that satellite television stations should not be subject to the same regulatory
fee payment as fully powered television stations. The NAB contends that satellite television stations should be
assessed as if they were television translator stations. KBS argues that our proposal to assess fees for satellite
stations at the same level as full powered stations is inconsistent with section 9. First, in KBS's view, Congress
established regulatory fees for commercial television stations, and did not set any fee requirement for satellite
television stations. Second, according to KBS, Congress intended the Commission to charge licensees fees based
on the regulatory burden they impose, yet satellite stations require much less regulatory oversight than full powered
stations. Also, KBS contends that the fee would place an unfair and illogical burden on small market licensees who
use satellite television stations to reach remote areas in their markets.

82. Section 9(g)'s fee schedule establishes specific fees for commercial television stations. These fees are to
be assessed against a licensee solely on the basis of the market in which the station operates. The text of the schedule
makes no distinction between commercial stations that are fully operational and those that are satellite stations.
It is also clear that these satellite stations are not ``translator stations,'' which are also listed in the schedule.
TV translator stations are low-powered facilities that rebroadcast the signals of a full service television broadcast
station, including a satellite station, and are afforded secondary status vis-a-vis full service television stations.
Also, unlike satellite stations, they are not subject to the technical, operational and program service obligations
that are imposed on all full service broadcast stations, including satellite stations.
 Consequently, we find that in establishing fees for commercial stations, Congress assessed the same fee for both
commercial fully operational and commercial satellite television stations. We therefore reject KBS's argument
that Congress failed to establish a fee for television satellite stations. However, there are anomalies concerning
the treatment of satellite stations that are a matter of concern to us and that we believe would be appropriate for consideration
on a case-by-case basis. First, where a licensee would be required under the fee schedule to pay a higher fee for its
satellite station than for the parent station, we will entertain petitions to reduce the satellite station's fee
to the same amount as the fee due for the parent station. In such a case, the licensee would be required to submit with
its request an amount no greater than the fee due from the parent station. Second, in any situation in which payment
of the fee would cause a diminishment of a licensees ability to continue to serve the public, we will entertain requests
for waiver or reduction of the fee upon an appropriate showing. In this instance, the licensee would not be obligated
to pay the fee until resolution of its waiver request.

83. KBS and the NAB may submit comments in our future proceeding to establish regulatory fees for FY 1995, supporting
their positions concerning the need to distinguish between satellite and fully operational stations when assessing
regulatory fees. As explained above, for FY 1994, we shall make no adjustments to Congress' fee schedule pursuant
to section 9(b).


3. Broadcast Auxiliary Stations


84. The Society of Broadcast Engineers, Inc. (SBE) believes that broadcast auxiliary facilities, such as remote
pick-up stations, and aural, television and low power auxiliary stations, should not be subject to any regulatory
fee. SBE explains that there is no justification to apply a regulatory fee to these facilities since they are essentially
self-regulating and impose little burden on our resources. As indicated above, we shall not modify any of section
9(g)'s fee requirements for FY 1994, but SBE may raise these issues in future proceedings.


4. ITFS and DBS


85. Finally, the Joint Parties contend that we should amend the fee schedule to add several services not subject to
fees for FY 1994. These services include the commercial offering of Instructional Television Fixed Services (ITFS)
and Direct Broadcast Satellite Service (DBS). We decline the Joint Parties' request to add these services to the schedule
for 1994 since Congress did not provide us the authority to add any service to the schedule for FY 1994. Moreover, we
are aware that ITFS is a predominantly nonprofit service with limited commercial use and, further, that DBS is not
expected to become operational prior to the time for calculating fee payments for FY 1994.
 To the extent that the Joint Parties wish to renew their arguments concerning the inclusion of these services for future
years, they may do so when we consider our fee payment schedule for FY 1995.




C. Common Carrier Bureau


86. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communications operation as determined
by its number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas. We intend to rely upon the Common Carrier Bureau's
licensing data bases to confirm the identity and fee amount for most radio common carriers to the extent possible.
We also intend to perform periodic, random audits to determine whether individual regulatees have reported the correct
multiplier.


1. Cellular and Public Mobile Licensees


87. The Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA) states that we should define the term ``subscriber''
as it applies to Part 22 and personal communications services licensees. PCIA suggests that we require Part 22 licensees
to pay their fees based on the number of customers on their billing lists and urges that we permit Part 22 licensees to
submit their fee payments pursuant to systemwide aggregations of subscribers. Also, PCIA contends that we should
permit paging licensees to calculate their fees by aggregating their total subscribers, rather determining their
fee payments by call sign, as required by section 9(g), and to submit one instrument of payment per carrier system.





88. Our rules do not define a mobile service subscriber. For purposes of calculating regulatory fees, we will define
a subscriber to a mobile service as an individual or entity authorized by the mobile service provider to operate under
its blanket license in exchange for monetary consideration. Further, any Part 22 licensee may submit a single, aggregate
payment to cover the regulatory fees due for each of its individual systems. However, each individual system and service
should be clearly enumerated on the payor's FCC Form 159 accompanying the fee payment. PCIA may submit its proposal
to modify the method for calculating fee payments by paging licensees in our proceeding for establishing fees for
FY 1995.


2. Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service


89. Claircom Communications Group, L.P., GTE and In-Flight Phone Corporation request clarification of the definition
of ``subscriber'' in section 9(g) when applied to the payment of regulatory fees for the Air-Ground Telephone Service.
Unlike conventional telephone service, subscribers to that service, usually operators of commercial aircraft,
lease their service for the purpose of making it available to their own customers. There is no contractual relationship
between the air-ground service operator and the end user of its service. Consequently, as suggested by the parties,
we will treat the operator of an aircraft in which its service is installed as the subscriber to the service and charge
the fee based upon the number of transceivers leased by the operator. Similarly, licensees in the air-ground service
should include in their total fee a payment on a transceiver basis for service they provide to users other than commercial
aircraft, such as private aircraft.


3. Space Stations


90. Comsat General Corporation (Comsat), GE American Communications, Inc. (GE American), Orbital Communications
Corporation (Orbital), PanAmSat, L.P. (Panamsat) and Starsys Global Postioning, Inc. (Starsys) have submitted
comments addressed to our proposals concerning the requirements of satellite licensees to submit regulatory fees.
Comsat and GTE state that the regulatory fee for a geosynchronous orbit space station is excessive. Comsat argues
that the fee requirement should be lowered for FY 1994 because these systems no longer require the regulatory attention
they received in their earlier developmental stage. It argues that the fee also is a disincentive to maintaining older
and underutilized satellites in orbit for back-up purposes and is anticompetitive and anticonsumer. As we have stated
earlier, we shall not adjust the schedule of fees that Congress has enacted for the assessment of fees for FY 1994. Comsat
may submit its comments in the future proceeding that we will initiate in order to establish appropriate fees for FY
1995.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00052 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

91. We also received comments from Orbital and a reply comment from Starsys concerning when a satellite space station
becomes subject to the fee requirement. Section 9(g) requires that the payment of a regulatory fee by the operator
of any ``operational'' space station in geosynchronous orbit. We agree with the commenters that a satellite does
not become ``operational'' immediately upon its launch. Therefore, as proposed by the commenters, we will consider
a space station in geosynchronous orbit to be subject to the fee when it has been certified by its operator to be operational
in accordance with section 25.120(d) of the rules. This certification indicates that the satellite has been placed
in its authorized orbit and is operating in the authorized frequency bands at the authorized power levels. Similarly,
a space station or system will be considered to have terminated its operation when its licensee certifies to us that
the satellite has ceased to operate.

92. Also, we will consider a space system in low earth orbit (LEO) subject to the fee payment when its first satellite
becomes operational even though all its space stations are not yet operational. Similar to our treatment of geosynchronous
satellites, the system will become subject to a fee payment upon the certification by the licensee that the operations
of the first satellite in its system conform to the terms and conditions of its authorization pursuant to 47 CFR 25.120(d).



4. Earth Stations



93. AMSC Subsidiary Corporation contends that no payment of regulatory fees for earth stations and mobile terminals
should be required until their related satellite system is operational.
 However, we observe that the licensing of satellite earth stations is entirely separate from the licensing of space
stations and that fixed-satellite earth stations are generally licensed to operate with any and all domestic satellite
systems located in that portion of the geostationary orbit for which the earth station has been frequency coordinated.
It is common practice for a satellite system to provide preliminary service via unrelated space stations before its
own stations are launched and operational.





94. We will require the licensee of an earth station to pay a fee once it has certified that the earth station's construction
is completed. However, in those rare instances in which a license limits an earth station's operational authority
to a particular satellite system and that system is not operational on the date for calculating the fee, the fee will
not be due until the first satellite of the related system becomes ``operational'' within the meaning of our fee rules.

5. Interexchange and Local Exchange Services



95. Generally, the comments of local exchange carriers (LECs) and interexchange carriers (IXCs) raise issues concerning
the basis upon which they are to calculate their fee payments, the need for a definition of the term ``subscriber,''
and a date for calculating their fee payments.






96. We will adopt our proposal to permit the holding company of local exchange carriers to aggregate fee payments due
by its operating companies and submit a single payment to cover the fee requirements of its subsidiaries.
 We have considered the proposals of several commenters, including Ameritech, Nynex and SWB, that LECs submit fees
based upon ARMIS data. However, ARMIS data is required from comparatively few LECs and we would still need a mechanism
to calculate the fees due from the vast majority of LECs. Therefore, we have decided that all LECs are to calculate the
amount of their regulatory fees based upon the number of working loops as described in section 36.611 of our rules,
governing the submission of Information to the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA).
 We believe that this definition will be simple to administer since the LECs currently compile subscriber loop data,
and it will provide a consistent formulation for the assessment of fees from all LECs.
 As noted, for FY 1994, we will require LECs to calculate their fee payments for FY 1994 as of December 31, 1993.









97. In the 

NPRM,

 we invited comments concerning section 9(g)'s assessment of regulatory fees from IXCs on a subscriber basis. In response,
AT&T, opposed by Wiltel, Inc., argues that fee payments by IXCs should be based on gross revenues, not by the number
of a carrier's subscribers. We decline to reach the merits of AT&T's argument at this time because, as indicated
above, we shall not adjust the fee schedule for FY 1994. Any reformulation of the basis upon which IXCs are to base their
fee payments would constitute a substantial adjustment to the fee schedule that Congress enacted. IXCs shall file
fees based on the total number of common lines presubscribed to that IXC as determined pursuant to section 69.116 of
the rules. 47 C.F.R.  69.116. AT&T may submit its views concerning the appropriate method of assessing
fees from IXCs in our proceeding to establish regulatory fees for FY 1995.



6. International Bearer Circuits



98. Panamsat requests clarification concerning the assessment of regulatory fees for international circuits.
Section 9(g)'s Schedule provides that the fee is to be computed ``per 100 active 64 KB circuits or equivalent.'' The
fee is to be paid by the facilities-based common carrier activating the circuit in any transmission facility for the
provision of service to an end user or resale carrier. Private submarine cable operators also are to pay fees for circuits
sold on an indefeasable right of use (IRU) basis or leased in their private submarine cables to any customer of the private
cable operator. In the 

NPRM,

 we stated that the fee would be based upon active 64 KB circuits, or equivalent circuits. Under this formulation, 64
KB circuits or their equivalent will be assessed a fee. Equivalent circuits include the 64 KB circuit equivalent of
larger bit stream circuits. For example, the 64 KB circuit equivalent of a 2.048 MB circuit is 30 64 KB circuits. Analog
circuits such as 3 and 4 KHz circuits used for international services are also included as equivalent 64 KB circuits.
However, circuits derived from 64 KB circuits such as circuits derived by the use of digital circuit multiplication
systems are not equivalent 64 KB circuits. Such circuits are not subject to fees. Only the 64 KB circuit from which they
have been derived will be subject to payment of a fee.

For analog television channels we will assess fees as follows:






D. Cable Services



99. Several commenters contend that the fee prescribed for cable television services should be paid on an exact per
subscriber count rather than per 1,000 subscribers, as we proposed.
 These commenters argue that the latter formulation would cause small cable systems to pay a disproportionately high
regulatory fee. For example, a cable system with 100 subscribers would be subject to the same fee as a system with 1,000
subscribers.





100. The text of section 9(g)'s fee schedule provides for the assessment of a fee for cable television systems at the
rate of $370.00 per 1,000 subscribers. Upon further consideration, we agree with the commenters that Congress did
not intend that this provision required that a system pay its fee as if it served 1,000 subscribers when in fact it provides
services to fewer than 1,000 subscribers.
 Following this formulation to its logical extreme would impose on small cable systems a disproportionate burden
of the aggregate cable service regulatory fee since it would result in the assessment of larger fees upon small systems,
particularly those with fewer than 1,000 subscribers. Thus, we believe Congress' purpose was to require cable systems
to formulate their fee based on the schedule's assessment of $370.00 per 1000 subscribers, but to pay the fee on an exact
per subscriber count. Payment of the cable fee on the basis of the exact count of a system's subscribers will eliminate
the inequity perceived by the commenters.




101. NCTA and Nationwide support our proposal to permit cable systems to submit their regulatory fees on the basis
of the aggregate fee payable by commonly owned systems.
 Therefore, we will permit commonly-owned cable systems to combine their fee payments for submission to our lockbox
bank. Finally, for purposes of calculating the fee due from cable operators, we will adopt the definition of a cable
subscriber, including bulk rate subscriber, used for FCC Form 325. See FCC Form 325 Instructions (Page 3).






V. Amendments to Application Fee Rules



102. In addition to the new rules for regulatory fees, we are revising several sections of our rules governing fees
associated with applications and other filings. Filing fees are required pursuant to section 8 of the Communications
Act and are administered separately from the regulatory fees authorized under section 9.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. Fees for Resubmitted Applications



103. We have amended  1.1107(d) of the rules, as proposed. Section 1.1107(d) governs fee payments relating
to applications and other filings when resubmitted in the appropriate timeframe following a staff request for additional
or corrected information. We have amended  1.1107(d) to require persons submitting applications or other
filings that have been returned for additional information or corrections and that do not require any additional
fees to submit these applications and other filings directly to the Bureau/Office making the request. Applications
requiring additional fees must be filed at our lockbox bank with the remittance for the entire additional amount due.
In the event that the staff discovers, within 30 days after the resubmission, that the additional fee payment was not
submitted, the application or other filing will be dismissed as deficient and the previously submitted section 8
fee payment will be retained under this proposal. A new fee payment (covering the entire amount of the revised fee)
will be required with any future filing of the application or other filing. However, if the staff discovers the fee
payment deficiency more than thirty days subsequent to the resubmission, the application or other filing will be
retained, but a 25 percent late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if we have completed our action on the
application or other filing involved.



B. Stale Checks



104. Our lockbox bank will not process a personal or business check dated more than six months prior to its submission.
Therefore, we have revised  1.1108(a) of the rules to make clear that these ``stale'' checks will not be accepted
as fee payments. Under this revision, we will not accept any instrument of payment dated more than six months prior
to the date of its filing with the lockbox bank, and we will return to the filer any application or other filing submitted
with a stale payment instrument. Further, we will not accept any third party checks (

i.e.

, checks with the name of any third party as the maker or endorser).



C. Receipts



105. Our practice with regard to stamped receipts for application fee payments is to furnish receipts only upon specific
request of the submitter rather than to provide receipts automatically for all fee payments received. We are clarifying
these procedures by amending  1.1108 of the rules. In order to obtain a receipt for a fee payment, section 1.1108
will require that the application and fee package include a copy of the first page of the application or other filing,
clearly marked ``copy,'' submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should
be the top document in the fee payment package. The staff will date-stamp the copy immediately and provide it to the
bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return
mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain
the date-stamped copy of the application. We will provide a receipt for regulatory fee payments, upon request, if
we are furnished with a copy of Form 159 or the first page of an application in the private radio services accompanying
the fee payment and the request otherwise conforms with the procedures we have adopted for receipts of application
fees.



D. Electronic Application Fee Payments



106. We are adopting rules regarding the submission of regulatory fee payments by electronic means. Revised   1.1107
and 1.1108 of the rules allow the payment of application and other filing fees by electronic means, although our system
for electronic payment is not yet fully in place. In our 

NPRM

, we stated our concern about matching electronically paid fees with submitted hard-copy applications.
 If a party chooses to pay its application filing fee electronically, we will require that the entity follow existing
procedures for filing its application at the lockbox bank. However, in lieu of the current payment methods, the party
will indicate on its remittance advice (FCC Form 159 or the underlying application form with fee information incorporated
therein) that payment is being sent to the bank electronically. The electronic payment must be made on or before the
day the application is filed. Upon receipt of an application, the bank will confirm that a fee payment has been received
electronically. If the electronic payment is not received on the filing date, the application or request will be returned
without processing. We believe these procedures are necessary to ensure the most efficient processing of electronic
fee payments (when authorized) and applications or other filings. Finally, during the pilot phase of our electronic
payment program, regulatees will be required to obtain our prior authorization before making electronic fee payments.
(See paragraphs 56 and 57, above.)





E. One Check/One Application Rule



107. We are modifying our rules to allow the use of a single payment instrument or method to cover multiple applications
for the same or different applicants, so long as all the applications are filed at the same time at the same lockbox.
Any applicant desiring to pay for multiple regulatory/application filings in the same lockbox with a single payment
instrument, or when paying by credit card, must also complete FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance Advice. Each item must be
listed separately on the form with its own Payment Type Code. If another space is needed for multiple filings, the applicant
must use FCC Form 159-C, FCC Remittance Advice Continuation Sheet.






F. Payment by Cashier's Check



108. To ensure that payment instruments will result in a final payment being made to the Commission, we believe that
our cashier's check safeguard should be strengthened. Accordingly, as proposed, when a person or organization has,
on one or more occasions, submitted a payment instrument on which final payment is not received (and is not excused
by bank error), we will immediately notify the party that future fee payments must be made by cashier's check until
further notice. If, subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by a cashier's check (or cash), that party's other
payment instrument will not be accepted and its application or other filing will be returned. 47 CFR 1.1108(d)(1)(i);
see also 47 CFR 1.1110(a).

G. Filing Locations for Petitions and Applications for Review



109. We have revised   1.1109(a)(3) and 1.1115 to clarify that any petition for reconsideration, application
for review, and any petition for waiver or deferral of a fee payment, accompanied by an application or regulatory fee
payment, must be submitted to our lockbox bank. If no fee payment is required and the matter is within the scope of either
the application or regulatory fee rules, the request should be filed with the Secretary and clearly marked to the attention
of the Managing Director.



VI. Confidentiality



110. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, GTE and Southwestern Bell Corporation urge that we
amend  0.457 of our rules to safeguard the confidentiality of data submitted with regulatory fees, including
fee amounts that are calculated on a per line or subscriber basis. 47 CFR 0.457. At this time, we will not amend our rules
to include a provision affording automatic confidentiality for information submitted with regulatory fees. Generally,
regulatees are required to submit very little data with their fee payments and it is premature for us to determine whether
the disclosure of any information submitted, including the fee amounts calculated on a per subscriber basis, will
warrant the protection afforded by  0.457. Payments of regulatory fees may be accompanied by requests for confidentiality
pursuant to  0.459 of the Commission's rules. 47 CFR 0.459.



VII. Final Regulatory Analysis



111. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission's final analysis is as follows:



A. Need and Purpose of This Action



112. This 

Report and Order

 adopts the Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted by Congress for the assessment and collection of the Commission's
regulatory fees for FY 1994 and adopts rules to govern the assessment and collection of regulatory fees for FY 1994
and future years. The rules, as required by Congress, include provisions for the advance payment of small fees, the
payment of large fees by installment, and procedures for waiver, reduction and deferral of fees by regulatees that
demonstrate that payment of the fee would be a financial hardship, as well as penalties for late or nonpayment of fees.



B. Summary of Comments Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



113. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) filed comments urging
that cable television system operators be permitted to pay their fees on a per subscriber basis ($.37) rather than
in increments of 1,000 subscribers ($370.00) or any portion thereof. The 

Report and Order

 adopts the SBA's proposal.



C. Significant Alternatives Considered



114. The 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 in this proceeding offered many proposals, including reliance on the Schedule of Regulatory Fees as established
by Congress in section 9(g) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 159(g), exemptions from regulatory fees, installment
payments for large fees, advance payments for small fees, payment procedures, including payment by electronic transfer
and credit card, procedures for waiver, reduction and deferment of fees, and penalties for late or nonpayment of fees.
Our proposals to adopt the service categories and fee amounts in Congress' fee schedule and for waiver, reduction
and deferment of fees were discussed by many commenters. Fireweed and the Joint Commenters urged that we amend the
fee schedule to reduce the fees and add services subject to a fee payment. NAB and the State Broadcasters urged that
we modify our proposed procedures for requesting a waiver, reduction or deferment of a fee payment. Upon review, we
affirmed that Congress intended that we utilize section 9(g)'s fee schedule for FY 1994. However, we adopted more
flexible procedures for obtaining a waiver, reduction or deferment of the fees in order to afford more regulatees
the opportunity to obtain a waiver, reduction or deferment of the fees and we clarified the showing required for adjustment
of a fee based on financial hardship.



VIII. Ordering Clauses



115. Accordingly, 

it is ordered

 that the rule changes as specified below 

are adopted.



116. 

It is further ordered

 1.742


Place of filing, fees and number of copies.



All applications which do not require a fee shall be filed at the Commission's main office in Washington, DC., Attention:
Office of the Secretary. Hand-delivered applications will be dated by the Secretary upon receipt (mailed applications
will be dated by the Mail Branch) and then forwarded to the Common Carrier Bureau. All applications accompanied by
a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's lockbox bank in accordance with  1.1105, Schedule of Fees.
The number of copies required for each application and the nonrefundable processing fees and any applicable regulatory
fees (see subpart G of this part) which must accompany each application in order to qualify it for acceptance for filing
and consideration are set forth in the rules in this Chapter relating to various types of applications. However, if
any application is not of the type covered by this Chapter, an original and two copies of each such application shall
be submitted.

5a. Sections 1.1106 through 1.1117 are redesignated as   1.1107 through 1.1118, respectively.

5b. In the list below, for each newly designated section indicated in the left column, remove the reference indicated

 1.1108



Payment of charges.



(a) Electronic fee payments do not require the use of a FCC Form 159, Remittance Advice. An electronic fee payment must
be made on or before the day the application and appropriate processing form are filed.

(b) The schedule of fees for applications and other filings lists those applications and other filings that must be
accompanied by a FCC Form 159, Remittance Advice. A separate FCC Form 159 will not be required once the information
requirements of that form (payor information) is incorporated into the underlying application form.

(c) Applications and other filings that are not submitted in accordance with these instructions will be returned
as unprocessable.






Note: 

This requirement for the simultaneous submission of fee forms with applications or other filings does not apply to
the payment of fees for which the Commission has established a billing process. See  1.1118 of this subpart.




(d) Applications returned to applicants for additional information or corrections will not require an additional
fee when resubmitted, unless the additional information results in an increase of the original fee amount. Those
applications not requiring an additional fee should be resubmitted directly to the Bureau/Office requesting the
additional information. The original fee will be forfeited if the additional information or corrections are not
resubmitted to the appropriate Bureau/Office by the prescribed deadline. If an additional fee is required, the original
fee will be returned and the application must be resubmitted with a new remittance in the amount of the required fee
to the Commission's lockbox bank. Applicants should attach a copy of the Commission request for additional or corrected
information to their resubmission.


(1) If the Bureau/Office staff discovers within 30 days after the resubmission that the required fee was not submitted,
the application will be dismissed.

(2) If after 30 days the Bureau/Office staff discovers the required fee has not been paid, the application will be retained
and a 25 percent late fee will be assessed on the deficient amount even if the Commission has completed its action on
the application. Any Commission actions taken prior to timely payment of these charges are contingent and subject
to recession.

(a) Fee payments should be in the form of a check, bank draft, on money order denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on
a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications Commission or by a Visa or MasterCard
credit card. No other credit card is acceptable. Fees for applications and other filings paid by credit card will not
be accepted unless the credit card section of FCC Form 159 is completed in full. The Commission discourages applicants
from submitting cash and will not be responsible for cash sent through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated
more than six months prior to their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and postdated checks will not be accepted
and will be returned as deficient. Third party checks (

i.e., 

checks with a third party as maker or endorser) will not be accepted.

request to the Commission for authorization to make electronic payments of a fee for applications and other filings,
as follows. 

(2) No electronic payment of an application fee will be accepted unless the payor has obtained the written authorization
of the Commission to submit application fees electronically. It is the responsibility of the payor to insure that
any electronic payment is made in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures
will result in the return of the application or other filing and the fee payment. 

(3) Payments by wire transfer will be accepted. Prior to making a payment by wire, the payor shall obtain the approval
of the Managing Director or his designee. A completed FCC Form 159 shall be submitted to the Managing Director or his
designee prior to initiating the wire transfer. 



* * * * *



(d) The Commission may require payment of fees with a cashier's check upon notification to an applicant or filer or
prospective group of applicants under the conditions set forth below in paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section.


(1) Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or organization has made payment, on one or more occasions
with a payment instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and such failure is not excused by
bank error. 

(2) The Commission will notify the party in writing that future payments must be made by cashier's check until further
notice. If, subsequent to such notice, payment is not made by cashier's check, the party's payment will not be accepted
and its application or other filing will be returned.

(f) The Commission will furnish a stamped receipt of an application only upon request. In order to obtain a stamped
receipt for an application (or other filing), the application package must include a copy of the first page of the application,
clearly marked ``copy'', submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt of the filing. The copy should
be the top document in the package. The copy will be date-stamped immediately and provided to the bearer of the submission,
if hand delivered. For submissions by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached
to the receipt copy a stamped self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the date stamped copy of the application.
No remittance receipt copies will be furnished.

subpart must be accompanied by the required fee for the application or other filing being considered or reviewed.

or  1.1113 of this subpart shall file their applications in the appropriate location as set forth in the rules

(a) Payments of regulatory fees shall be submitted with the filing of any application for a new, renewal or reinstatement
of a license or other authorization in the private radio services.

(1) Any regulatory fee submitted with an application in the private radio services shall include an advance payment
of the total annual regulatory fee payment due for the entire term of the license or other authorization. The amount

any subsequent increase or decrease in the annual amount of a fee required under the Schedule of Regulatory Fees.

(2) Failure to file the appropriate regulatory fee with an application in the private radio service will result in
the return of the accompanying application, including an application for which the Commission has assigned a specific
filing deadline.

(b)(1) Payments of standard regulatory fees, applicable to mass media, common carrier and cable services, shall
be filed in full on an annual basis at a time announced by the Commission or the Managing Director, pursuant to delegated
authority, and published in the 

Federal Register.

(c) Standard regulatory fee payments, as well as any installment payment, must be filed with a FCC Form 159, FCC Remittance
Advice, and a FCC Form 159C, Remittance Advice Continuation Sheet, if additional space is needed. Failure to submit

16. Section 1.1157 is added to read as follows:



 1.1157

Form of payment for regulatory fees.



Any regulatory fee payment must be submitted in the form of a check, bank draft or money order denominated in U.S. dollars
and drawn on a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications Commission or by
Visa or Mastercard credit cards only. The Commission discourages applicants from submitting cash payments and will
not be responsible for cash sent through the mail. Personal or corporate checks dated more than six months prior to
their submission to the Commission's lockbox bank and postdated checks will not be accepted and will be returned as
deficient.

(a) Upon authorization from the Commission following a written request, electronic payment of a regulatory fee may
be made as follows:

(1)(i) The payor may instruct its bank to make payment of the regulatory fee directly to the Commission's lockbox bank;
or

(ii) The payor may authorize the Commission to direct its lockbox bank to withdraw funds directly from the payor's
bank account.

(2) No electronic payment of a regulatory fee will be accepted unless the payor has obtained the written authorization
of the Commission to submit regulatory fees electronically. Procedures for electronic payment of regulatory fees
will be announced by Public Notice. It is the responsibility of the payor to insure that any electronic payment is made
in the manner required by the Commission. Failure to comply with the Commission's procedures for electronic fee payment
will result in the return of the fee payment, and a penalty fee of 25 percent if the subsequent refiling of the fee payment
is late. Failure to comply will also subject the payor to the penalties set forth in section 1.1163.

(b) Multiple payment instruments for a single regulatory fee are not permitted, except that the Commission will accept
multiple money orders in payment of any fee where the fee exceeds the maximum amount for a money order established by
the issuing entity and the use of multiple money orders is the only practicable means available for payment.

(c) Payment of multiple standard regulatory fees (including an installment payment) due on the same date, may be made
with a single payment instrument and cover mass media, common carrier and cable service fee payments. Each regulatee
is solely responsible for accurately accounting for and listing each license or authorization and the number of subscribers,
access lines, or other relevant units on the accompanying FCC Form 159 and, if needed, FCC Form 159C and for making full
payment for every regulatory fee listed on the accompanying form. Any omission or payment deficiency of a regulatory
fee will result in a 25 percent penalty of the amount due and unpaid.

(d) Any regulatory fee payment (including a regulatory fee payment submitted with an application in the private radio
service) made by credit card or money order must be submitted with a completed FCC Form 159. Failure to accurately enter
the credit card number and date of expiration and the payor's signature in blocks number 22 and 23 of FCC Form 159 will
result in rejection of the credit card payment.




17. Section 1.1158 is added to read as follows:



 1.1158

for matching fees, forms and applications submitted at different times or locations. 

(b) Petitions for reconsideration or applications for review of fee decisions submitted with a standard regulatory
fee payment pursuant to   1.1153 through 1.1155 are to be filed with the Commission's lockbox bank in the
manner set forth in   1.1153 through 1.1155 for payment of the fee subject to the petition for reconsideration
or the application for review. Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review that are submitted with
no accompanying payment should be filed with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Attention: Managing
Director, Washington, DC 20554.

(c) Any request for exemption from a regulatory fee shall be filed with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission,
Attention: Managing Director, Washington, DC 20554, except that requests for exemption accompanied by a tentative
fee payment shall be filed at the lockbox set forth for the appropriate service in   1.1152 through 1.1155.

(d) The Commission will furnish a receipt for a regulatory fee payment only upon request. In order to obtain a receipt
for a regulatory fee payment, the package must include an extra copy of the Form FCC 159 or, if a Form 159 is not required
with the payment, a copy of the first page of the application or other filing submitted with the regulatory fee payment,
submitted expressly for the purpose of serving as a receipt for the regulatory fee payment and application fee payment,
if required. The document should be clearly marked ``copy'' and should be the top document in the package. The copy
will be date stamped immediately and provided to the bearer of the submission, if hand delivered. For submissions
by mail, the receipt copy will be provided through return mail if the filer has attached to the receipt copy a stamped
self-addressed envelope of sufficient size to contain the receipt document.




18. Section 1.1159 is added to read as follows:



 1.1159

Refunds of regulatory fees.



(a) Regulatory fees will be refunded, upon request, only in the following instances:

(1) When no regulatory fee is required or an excessive fee has been paid. In the case of an overpayment, the refund amount
will be based on the applicants', permittees', or licensees' entire submission. All refunds will be issued to the
payor named in Block Number 3 of the FCC Form 159.

(2) In the case of advance payment of regulatory fees, subject to  1.1152, a refund will be issued based on unexpired
full years:

(i) When the Commission adopts new rules that nullify a license or other authorization, or a new law or treaty renders
a license or other authorization useless;

(ii) When a licensee in the private radio service surrenders the license or other authorization subject to a fee payment
to the Commission; or

(iii) When the Commission declines to grant an application submitted with a regulatory fee payment.

(3) When a waiver is granted in accordance with  1.1165 of this subpart.

(d) No refunds will be processed without a written request from the applicant, permittee, licensee or agent.




19. Section 1.1160 is added to read as follows:



 1.1160

Conditional license grants and delegated authorizations.



(a) Grant of any application or an instrument of authorization or other filing, for which a regulatory fee is required
to accompany the application or filing, will be conditioned upon final payment of the regulatory fee. Final payment
shall mean receipt by the U.S. Treasury of funds cleared by the financial institution on which the check, bank draft,
money order, credit card, wire or electronic payment is drawn.

(1) If, prior to a grant of an instrument of authorization, the Commission is notified that final payment of the regulatory
fee has not been made, the application or filing:

(i) Will be dismissed and returned;

(ii) Shall lose its place in the processing line; and

(iii) Will not be treated as timely filed if resubmitted after the relevant filing deadline.

(2) If, subsequent to a grant of an instrument of authorization or other filing, the Commission is notified that final
payment has not been made, the Commission will:

(i) Automatically rescind that instrument of authorization;

(ii) Notify the grantee of this action; and

(iii) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the original deadline for filing the application.

(3) Upon receipt of a notification of rescission of the authorization, the grantee will immediately cease operations
initiated pursuant to the authorization.

(b) In those instances where the Commission has granted a request for deferred payment of a regulatory fee, further
processing of the application or filing or the grant of authority shall be conditioned upon final payment of the regulatory
fee and any required penalties for late payment prescribed by the deferral decision. Failure to comply with the terms
of the deferral decision shall result in the automatic dismissal of the submission or rescission of the Commission
authorization. Further, the Commission shall:

(1) Notify the grantee that the authorization has been rescinded. Upon such notification, the grantee will immediately
cease operations initiated pursuant to the authorization; and

(2) Treat as late filed any application resubmitted after the original deadline for filing the application.

(c) Where the procedures described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section would not provide a meaningful incentive
to pay a regulatory fee that is due or would not be a meaningful sanction for failure to pay such a fee, the Commission
may, in its discretion, whether the regulatory fee is required to be paid with an application for an instrument of authorization
or otherwise, withhold processing and/or grant of any application or filing made by a person or organization who has
failed to make full payment of any regulatory fee due.

(1) Before taking such action, the staff will make a written request for the fee, together with any penalties that may
be rendered under this subpart. Such request shall inform the regulatee that failure to pay may result in the Commission
withholding action on any application or request filed by the applicant. The staff shall also inform the regulatee
of the procedures for seeking Commission review of the staff's fee determination. 

(2) If, after final determination that the fee is due, payment is not made in a timely manner, the staff may terminate
processing and/or withhold any grant or petition requested by the person or organization subject to the fee payment
requirement, until the matter is resolved.

Adjustments to the fees established for any category of regulatory fee payment shall include of projected cost increases
or decreases of the in volume of licensees or units upon which the regulatory fee is calculated.

(c) The fees assessed shall:

(1) Be derived by determining the full-time equivalent number of employees performing enforcement activities,
policy and rulemaking activities, user information services, and international activities within the Private
Radio Bureau, Mass Media Bureau, Common Carrier bureau, Cable Services Bureau and other offices of the Commission,
adjusted to take into account factors that are reasonably related to the benefits provided to the payor of the fee by
the Commission's activities, including such factors as service coverage area, shared use versus exclusive use,
and other factors that the Commission determines are necessary in the public interest;

(2) Be established at amounts that will result in collection, during each fiscal year, of an amount that can reasonably
be expected to equal the amount appropriated for such fiscal year for the performance of the activities described
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(d) The Commission shall by rule amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees by proportionate increases or decreases that
reflect, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section changes in the amount appropriated for the performance
of the activities described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for such fiscal year. Such proportionate increases
or decreases shall be adjusted to reflect unexpected increases or decreases in the number of licensees or units subject
to payment of such fees and result in collection of an aggregate amount of fees that will approximately equal the amount
appropriated for the subject regulatory activities.

(e) The Commission shall, by rule, amend the Schedule of Regulatory Fees if the Commission determines that the Schedule
requires amendment to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In making such amendments,
the Commission shall add, delete or reclassify services in the Schedule to reflect additional deletions or changes
in the nature of its services as a consequence of Commission rulemaking proceedings or changes in law.

(f) In making adjustments to regulatory fees, the Commission will round such fees to the nearest $5.00 in the case of
fees under $1,000.00, or to the nearest $25.00 in the case of fees of $1,000.00 or more.

22. Section 1.1163 is added to read as follows:



 1.1163

Penalties for late or insufficient regulatory fee payments.



Any late payment or insufficient payment of a regulatory fee, not excused by bank error, shall subject the regulatee
to a 25 percent penalty of the amount of the fee or installment payment which was not paid in a timely manner. A timely
fee payment or installment payment is one received at the Commission's lockbox bank by the due date specified by the
Commission or by the Managing Director. A payment will also be considered late filed if the payment instrument (check,
money order, bank draft or credit card) is uncollectible.

(a) The Commission may, in its discretion, following one or more late filed installment payments, require a regulatee
to pay the entire balance of its regulatory fee by a date certain, in addition to assessing a 25 percent penalty.

(b) In cases where a fee payment fails due to error by the payor's bank, as evidenced by an affidavit of an officer of the
bank, the date of the original submission will be considered the date of filing.

(c) If a regulatory fee is not paid in a timely manner, the regulatee will be notified of its deficiency. This notice
will automatically assess a 25 percent penalty, subject the delinquent payor's pending applications to dismissal,
and may require a delinquent payor to show cause why its existing instruments of authorization should not be subject
to rescission. 

(d)(1) Where a regulatee's new, renewal or reinstatement application is required to be filed with a regulatory fee
(as is the case with private radio services), the application will be dismissed if the regulatory fee is not included
with the application package. In the case of a renewal or reinstatement application, the application may not be refiled
unless the appropriate regulatory fee plus the 25 percent penalty charge accompanies the refiled application.

(2) If the application that must be accompanied by a regulatory fee is a mutually exclusive application with a filing
deadline, or any other application that must be filed by a date certain, the application will be dismissed if not accompanied
by the proper regulatory fee and will be treated as late filed if resubmitted after the original date for filing the
application.

(e) Any pending or subsequently filed application submitted by a party will be dismissed if that party is determined
to be delinquent in paying a standard regulatory fee or an installment payment. The application may be resubmitted
only if accompanied by the required regulatory fee and by any assessed penalty payment.

(f) In instances where the Commission may revoke an existing instrument of authorization for failure to file a regulatory
fee, the Commission will provide prior notice to the regulatee of such action and shall allow the licensee no less than
60 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the payment assessed is inapplicable or should otherwise be waived or
deferred.

(1) An adjudicatory hearing will not be designated unless the response by the regulatee to the Order to Show Cause presents
a substantial and material question of fact.

(2) Disposition of the proceeding shall be based upon written evidence only and the burden of proceeding with the introduction
of evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the respondent regulatee.

(3) Unless the regulatee substantially prevails in the hearing, the Commission may assess costs for the conduct of
the proceeding against the respondent regulatee. See 47 U.S.C. 402(b)(5).

(4) Any regulatee failing to submit a regulatory fee, following notice to the regulatee of failure to submit the required
fee, is subject to collection of the fee, including interest thereon, any associated penalties, and the full cost
of collection to the Federal government pursuant to section 3720A of the Internal Revenue Code, 31 U.S.C. 3720A and
to the provisions of the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3711. See 47 CFR 1.1901-1.1952. The debt collection processes
described may proceed concurrently with any other sanction in this section.

23. Section 1.1164 is added to read as follows:



 1.1164 

Payment by cashier's check for regulatory fees.



Payment by cashier's check may be required when a person or organization makes payment, on one or more occasions, with
a payment instrument on which the Commission does not receive final payment and such error is not excused by bank error.

24. Section 1.1165 is added to read as follows:



 1.1165 

Waivers, reductions and deferrals of regulatory fees.



The fees established by   1.1152 through 1.1155 of this subpart may be waived, reduced or deferred in specific
instances, on a case-by-case basis, where good cause is shown and where waiver, reduction or deferral of the fee would
promote the public interest. Requests for waivers, reductions or deferrals of regulatory fees for entire categories
of payors will not be considered.

(a) Requests for waivers, reductions or deferrals will be acted upon by the Managing Director with the concurrence
of the General Counsel. If the request for waiver, reduction or deferral is accompanied by a fee payment, the request
must be submitted to the Commission's lockbox bank at the address for the appropriate service set forth in  1.1152
through 1.1155 of this subpart. If no fee payment is submitted and the matter is within the scope of the fee rules in this
subpart the request should be filed with the Commission's Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing
Director. 

(b) Deferrals of fees will be granted for a period of six months following the date that the fee is initially due. 

(c) Petitions for waiver of a regulatory fee must be accompanied by the required fee and FCC Form 159. Submitted fees
will be returned if a waiver is granted. Waiver requests that do not include the required fees or forms will be dismissed
unless accompanied by a petition to defer payment due to financial hardship, supported by documentation of the financial
hardship. 

(d) Petitions for reduction of a fee must be accompanied by the full fee payment less the amount of the requested reduction
and FCC Form 159. Petitions for reduction accompanied by a fee payment must be addressed to the Federal Communications
Commission, Post Office Box 358835, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15251-5835.

25. Section 1.1166 is added to read as follows:



 1.1166 

Error claims related to regulatory fees.



(a) Challenges to determinations of an insufficient regulatory fee payment should be made in writing. Challenges
submitted with a fee payment must be submitted to the same location as the original fee payment, marked ``Attention:
Fee Supervisor''. Challenges not accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the Commission's Secretary and
clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director.

(b) The filing of a petition for reconsideration or an application for review of a fee determination will not toll the
requirement that full and proper payment of the underlying fee payment be submitted, as required by the Commission's
action, or delegated action, on a request for waiver, reduction or deferment. Petitions for reconsideration and
applications for review submitted with a fee payment must be submitted to the same location as the original fee payment.
Petitions for reconsideration and applications for review not accompanied by a fee payment should be filed with the
Commission's Secretary and clearly marked to the attention of the Managing Director.

(1) Failure to submit the fee by the date required will result in the assessment of a 25 percent penalty.

(2) If the fee payment should fail while the Commission is considering the matter, the petition for reconsideration
or application for review will be dismissed.

Appendix A


Guidelines for Regulatory Fee Categories


1. The guidelines below provide an explanation of regulatory fee categories established by the Schedule of Regulatory
Fees in section 9(g) of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. 159(g). Where regulatory fee categories need interpretation
or clarification, we have relied on the legislative history of Section 9, our own experience in establishing and regulating
the various services subject to a fee requirement and the comments of the parties in our proceeding to adopt fees for
Fiscal Year 1994 and establish rules to implement the regulatory fee program. The categories and amounts set out in
the schedule might, by the next fiscal year and in subsequent fiscal years, be amended, adjusted, or modified to reflect
changes in the Commission's appropriations, our costs of providing the regulatory services to be recovered by the
fee program, and additions, reductions and changes in the services subject to the fee requirement. See 47 U.S.C. 159(b)
(2), (3).


1. Private Radio Bureau


2. The two levels of statutory fees for Private Radio services, exclusive use service and shared use services, were
established on the basis that those licensees who generally receive a higher quality communications channel, due
to exclusive or lightly shared frequency assignments, will pay a higher fee than those who share marginal quality
channels. House Report at 17. In addition, because of the relatively small annual fee amounts in the Private Radio
Services, applicants for new licenses and reinstatements and for renewal of their current licenses will be required
to pay a regulatory fee covering an entire license term, with only a percentage of all licensees paying a regulatory
fee in any one year.
3. Applications for modification or assignment of an existing authorization do not require payment of a regulatory
fee. The expiration date of these authorizations will not reflect a new license term when either modifications or
assignments are processed. In an effort to reduce public confusion, the Commission has provided separate post office
box addresses for these actions.


a. Exclusive Use Services


4. 

Land Mobile.

 Regulatees covered under this category include those authorized under Part 90 of the Commission's Rules to provide
limited access private radio service that allows high quality voice or digital communications between vehicles
or to fixed stations to further the business activities of the licensee. These services, using the 220-222 MHz
band and frequencies at 470 MHz and above, may be offered on a private carrier basis in the Specialized Mobile Radio
Services (SMRS). These land mobile licensees are subject to a regulatory fee of $16 per license per year. They will
pay either a $80 or $160 regulatory fee (depending whether their license term is 5 or 10 years).





5. 

Microwave

. Private microwave systems, authorized under part 94 of the Commission's Rules, provide telecommunications services
between fixed points and are often used to relay data and to control railroad, pipeline and utility equipment. Microwave
licensees are required to pay the total regulatory fee for the entire term of their license when filing their initial
or renewal application. The annual fee is $16 for a total of $80 to be filed with the application.

6. 

Interactive Video Data Service (IVDS)

. IVDS is a two-way point-to-multi-point radio service which provides information about products and services,
and allows subscribers to respond through their television sets. IVDS is offered on a private carrier basis and is
authorized under Part 95, Subpart F of the Commission's Rules. IVDS licensees will be assessed a regulatory fee of
$80 per license to cover each five year license term ($16 per year).

b. Shared Use Services and Other Authorizations


7. The specific categories of shared-use services listed below are not on the statutory schedule but were listed in
the House Report. As discussed above, we propose that emergency and public safety services would be exempted from
regulatory fees.
8. 

Aviation (Aircraft and Ground Stations)

. The aircraft radio service provides communications between aircraft or from aircraft to ground stations and includes
frequencies used to communicate with air traffic control facilities. See generally 47 CFR Part 87. Aviation aircraft
transceiver stations are subject to a regulatory fee of $7 per year per station (the total fee of $70 per station for
ten year license term is to be paid at the time a renewal or new application is filed). Aviation ground stations provide
communications to aircraft for weather or landing information, or for logistical support to aircraft operations.
These stations are subject to a regulatory fee of $7 per year per license (the total fee of $35 per license for five year
license term is to be paid at the time a renewal or new application is filed).
9. 

Marine (Coast and Ship Stations)

. Marine coast stations are land-based stations in the maritime services, authorized under Part 80 of our rules, which
provide communications services to ships and other watercraft in coastal and inland waterways. Coast stations are
subject to a $35 regulatory fee for each license, covering the five year license term ($7 per year). Marine ship stations,
also authorized under Part 80, provide telecommunications between watercraft or between watercraft and shore-based
stations. Shipboard radio installations are required by domestic and international law for large passenger or cargo
vessels. Radio equipment may be voluntarily installed on smaller vessels, such as recreational boats. Ship stations
are assessed a $70 regulatory fee per station, covering the ten year license term ($7 per year) and is to be paid at the
same time a license renewal application or new application is filed.
10. 

General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)

. GMRS, authorized under Part 95 of the Rules, is a land mobile radio service that provides personal and limited business
communications between vehicles or to fixed stations for short-range, two-way communications. Each GMRS license
is subject to a $35 regulatory fee, which covers the five year license term ($7 per year) and is to be paid at the same time
a license renewal application or new application is filed.
11. 

Other Land Mobile

. Licensees in the land mobile services not covered in the exclusive use category provide one or two way communications
between vehicles, persons or to fixed stations on a shared basis. These services, authorized under Part 90 of the Rules,
include radiolocation services, private carrier paging, industrial radio services and land transportation radio
services. Regulatory fees will be assessed on a per license basis with the $35 fee covering the five year license term
($7 per year) and is to be paid at the same time a license renewal application or new application is filed.


c. Amateur Vanity Call-Signs


12. If Part 97 of the Rules is amended by the Commission to authorize the use of vanity call-signs, amateur radio operators
would be able to request a specific call-sign. 

See Notice of Proposed Rule Making

 in PR Docket No. 93-305, 9 FCC Rcd 105 (1993). Each amateur licensee with a vanity call-sign will be assessed a
regulatory fee of $7 per year. The total fee of $70 will cover the ten year license term during which the call sign will
be in use. The first 10-year fee must be paid at the time a request for a vanity call-sign(s) is made. If a requested vanity
call-sign is not available or otherwise cannot be issued to the requestor, the regulatory fee will be refunded since
amateurs are expressly exempt under the statute from regulatory fees, unless they have received their vanity call-sign.


2. Mass Media Bureau


13. The regulatory fees for Mass Media services generally apply to broadcast licensees and permittees and to other
regulatees.
 We have exempted noncommercial educational broadcasters from regulatory fees.




a. AM Radio Stations


14. 

Class A

. Class A AM radio stations are unlimited time stations operating on a clear channel and designed to render primary
and secondary service over an extended service area and at relatively long distances from their transmitters. Class
A stations' primary service areas are protected from objectionable interference from other stations on the same
and adjacent channels, with secondary service areas protected from interference from other stations on the same
channel. The operating power shall not be less than 10 kW nor more than 50 kW. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class A AM
station will be assessed a $900 annual regulatory fee.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

15. 

Class B. 

Class B AM radio stations are unlimited time stations rendering service only over a primary service area. These stations
are authorized to operate with a minimum power of 0.25 kW (or, if less than 0.25 kW, an equivalent RMS antenna field of
at least 141 mV/m at 1 km) and a maximum power of 50 kW (or 10kW for stations that are authorized to operate in the 1605-1705
kHz band). For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class B AM station will be assessed a $500 annual regulatory fee.

16. 

Class C.

 Class C AM radio stations operate on local channels and are designed to render service only over a primary service area
that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. These stations are authorized to operate at not less than 0.25
kW, nor more than 1 kW. Class C stations that were previously licensed to operate with 0.1 kW may continue to do so under
our rules. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class C AM station will be assessed a $200 annual regulatory fee.

17. 

Class D.

 Class D AM radio stations operate either daytime, limited time or unlimited time with nighttime power less than 0.25
kW and an equivalent RMS antenna field of less than 141 mV/m at one km. Class D stations operate with daytime powers not
less than 0.25 kW nor more than 50 kW. Nighttime operations of Class D stations are not afforded protection and must
protect all Class A and Class B operations during nighttime hours. For FY 1994, each licensee of a Class D AM station
will be assessed a $250 annual regulatory fee.

18. 

AM Construction Permits.

 For FY 1994, persons holding a construction permit for a any class of a new am station are subject to a $100 annual regulatory
fee for each outstanding permit. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction permit, this fee
is no longer applicable. Instead, licensees will pay a regulatory fee amount based upon the designated class of the
licensed station, as described above, as of the date the regulatory fee payment is due.



b. FM Radio Stations



19. 

Licensed Stations. 

FM radio stations must meet the location, power and antenna height requirements for stations designated as Classes
C, C1, C2, or B, as set forth in sections 73.205, 73.210 and 73.211 of the Commission's Rules. For FY 1994, each commercial
licensee of a Class C, C1, C2, or B FM station will be assessed a $900 annual regulatory fee per license. FM radio stations
meeting the location, power and antenna height requirements for stations designated as Classes A, B1, or C3, as set
forth in the Commission's rules, have a smaller coverage area. Thus, for FY 1994, each commercial licensee for a Class
A, B1, or C3 FM Station will be assessed a $600 annual regulatory fee per license.

20. 

FM Construction Permits.

 Persons holding a construction permit for any class of a new FM station, except Class D, are subject to a $500 annual
regulatory fee per outstanding permit in FY 1994. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction
permit, this fee is no longer applicable. Instead licensees will pay a regulatory fee based upon the designated class
of the licensed station, as described above, as of the regulatory fee payment is determined.



c. Television Stations



21. 

VHF and UHF Commercial Licenses. 

Commercial VHF and UHF television licensees, including licensees of satellite stations, will be assessed a regulatory
fee amount based on the ranking of the station's market. Specifically, for FY 1994 these annual regulatory fees are
as follows:







Stations authorized as ``satellite'' television stations pursuant to note 5 of Section 73.3555 of the Commission's
Rules (47 CFR 73.3555 note 5) will be assessed a fee on the same basis as other full power stations in the same market.

23. Television licensees subject to a regulatory fee above $12,000 will be automatically eligible to make two equal
installment payments.

<TEXT>
 

24. We have decided to rely upon the latest Arbitron market data to determine a television station's market ranking
for purposes of assessing regulatory fees. These rankings may be found in the Television and Cable Factbook published
by Warren Publishing. Changes in market rankings may affect regulatory fee amounts for the following fiscal year.

25. 

Television Construction Permits. 

For FY 1994, persons holding a construction permit for a new VHF television station, in any size market, are subject
to a $4,000 annual regulatory fee per outstanding permit. UHF construction permits for stations in any size market
will be assessed a $3,200 annual regulatory fee. Upon issuance of an operating license to cover the construction permit,
this construction permit fee is no longer applicable. Instead, licensees will pay a regulatory fee amount based upon
the licensed station's market ranking, as described above.



d. Low Power TV, TV Translator, and TV Booster Stations



26. Under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, low power UHF and VHF TV stations operate with a transmitter power output
limited to 0.01kw for a UHF facility and, generally, 1kw for a VHF facility, and may retransmit the programs and signals
of a full-power TV broadcast station, originate programming, and/or operate as a subscription service. TV translator
stations are authorized to retransmit the programs and signals of TV broadcast stations without significantly altering
the characteristic of the original signal other than its frequency and amplitude, for the purpose of providing TV
reception to the general public.

27. TV booster stations are operated by the licensee of a full service TV broadcast station to retransmit the programs
and signals of the licensee's station by amplifying and reradiating such signals, without significantly altering
the characteristics of the original signal other than its amplitude. For FY 1994, licensees of these secondary television
broadcast stations will be assessed a $135 annual regulatory fee per license.



e. Broadcast Auxiliary Stations



28. Licensees of remote pickup stations, aural broadcast auxiliary stations, television broadcast auxiliary stations,
and low power auxiliary stations, authorized under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, will be assessed a $25 per license
annual regulatory fee for FY 1994. These auxiliary stations are associated with a particular television or radio
broadcast station. Hence, those licensees will be required to pay the required regulatory fees for each auxiliary
license they hold. Individual users under 47 CFR subpart D, F and H will similarly have to pay the required regulatory
fee for each auxiliary license they hold.



f. International (HF) Broadcast Stations



International broadcast stations are licensed to operate on frequencies in the 5,950 khz to 26,100 khz band to provide
service to the general public in foreign countries. For FY 1994, each international broadcast licensee will be assessed
an annual regulatory fee of $200 per license.



3. Cable Services Bureau



a. Cable Antenna Relay Service



30. Cable television antenna relay service (``CARS'') stations are used to transmit television and related audio
signals, signals of AM and FM broadcast stations and cablecasting from the point of reception to a terminal point from
where the signals are distributed to the public by cable television systems. 

See

 47 C.F.R. Part 78. For FY 1994, each CARS licensee will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $220 per license.



b. Cable Television Systems



31. For FY 1994, each cable television system, as that term is defined in section 76.5 of our rules, will be assessed
an annual regulatory fee of $.37 per subscriber.






32. We will allow installment payments for these regulatory fees if the annual fee of a cable television system or a
group of commonly owned systems aggregating their regulatory fees exceeds $18,500.

<TEXT>
 

4. Common Carrier Bureau


32. Most common carrier regulatory fees are based on the size of a regulatee's communication operation as determined
by number of stations, subscribers, access lines, or antennas.


a. Mobile Services


33. 

Cellular and Public Mobile Licensees.

 Under Part 22 of our rules, common carriers are authorized to offer land-based or air-to-ground mobile telephone
or paging services to the public. In addition to cellular telephone service, these services include those using radio
to provide telephone services at fixed locations, such as Basic Exchange Telecommunications Radio Services, Rural
Radio and Offshore Radio. For FY 1994, each common carrier license authorized under Part 22 will be assessed an annual
regulatory fee of $.06 per subscriber.

34. 

Personal Communications Services.

 Licensed personal communications services (``PCS'') will consist of a wide variety of commercial or private mobile
communications services, including advanced paging, microcellular telephone communications, portable facsimile
and other video and data transmission services. See generally, 

First Report and Order, 

Gen. Docket No. 90-314 and ET Docket No. 92-100, 8 FCC Rcd 7162 (1993) (narrowband PCS); 

Second Report and Order,

 Gen. Docket No. 90-314, 8 FCC Rcd 7700 (1993) (broadband PCS). The statutory Schedule of Regulatory Fees enacted
in the 1993 Budget Act established an annual fee of $60 per 1,000 subscribers for PCS licensees. At the same time, the
1993 Budget Act recognized that PCS licenses have not yet been issued. In particular, Congress directed the Commission
to conclude its PCS rulemaking proceedings (Gen. Docket No. 90-314 and ET Docket No. 92-100) by February
6, 1994, and to commence the PCS licensing process by May 7, 1994.
 In addition, our new PCS service rules provide licensees five years to meet minimum construction requirements.
 Accordingly, since it is unlikely that any PCS licensee will have a significant number of subscribers in the immediate
future, no regulatory fees will be collected from PCS licensees during the 1994 fiscal year. We intend to begin assessing
and collecting regulatory fees for PCS in the 1995 fiscal year.






b. Space Stations



35. 

Space Stations in Geosynchronous Orbit.

 Domestic and international satellites, positioned in orbit to remain approximately fixed relative to the earth,
are authorized to provide communications between satellites and earth stations on a common carrier and/or private
carrier basis. For FY 1994, entities authorized to operate these space stations in accordance with  25.120(d),
will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $65,000 for each operational station in geosynchronous orbit on the date
for calculating fees. 47 CFR 25.120(d). Payment may be made in two installments.

36. 

Space Stations in Low-Earth Orbit.

 Domestic and international non-geostationary satellites, positioned in a low-earth orbit (``LEO''), may be authorized
to transmit to satellites and fixed or mobile earth stations. These services include the new non-voice, non-geostationary
mobile-satellite service, see 

Report and Order,

 CC Docket No. 92-76, 8 FCC Rcd 8450 (1993). Entities authorized to operate LEO systems will be assessed an annual

' gulatory fee of $90,000 for each such system. For purposes of assessing regulatory fees, a LEO operator is
required to submit its annual regulatory fees in the fiscal year in which it commences operating its first satellite,
pursuant to  25.120(d), even though all the space stations specified in its application or instrument of authorization
have not become operational. 47 CFR 25.120(d). While it appears unlikely that a LEO system will be operational by the
date for calculating fees for the 1994 fiscal year,
 should a LEO system be operational on the date for calculating fees during that period, we will require payment of a
regulatory fee for such operational systems. The entire annual fee amount will be required. Payment may be made in
two installments.





c. Public Fixed Radio Services



37. 

Domestic Public Fixed Services.

 Licensees in the Domestic Public Fixed Services are authorized to use microwave frequencies for video and data distribution
communications within the United States. These services, authorized under Part 21 of the Rules, include the Point-to-Point
Microwave Radio Service, Local Television Transmission Radio Service, Multipoint Distribution Service (single-channel
and multichannel) and Digital Electronic Message Service. For FY 1994, these licensees will be assessed an annual
regulatory fee of $55 per call-sign.

38. 

International Public Fixed Service.

 Licensees in the International Public Fixed Service are authorized as common carriers to provide radio communications
between the United States and a foreign point via microwave, HF, troposcatter systems (other than satellites and
satellite earth stations). This does not include service between the United States and Mexico and the United States
and Canada using frequencies above 72 MHz. See 47 CFR part 23. For FY 1994, these licensees will be assessed an annual
regulatory fee of $110 per call-sign.

39. 

VSAT and Equivalent C-Band Antennas.

 Earth station systems comprising very small aperture terminals make up authorized networks operating in the 12 and
14 GHz bands and provide a variety of communications services to other stations in the network. Each system, authorized
pursuant to blanket licensing procedures in Part 25 of the Rules, consists of a network of technically-identical
small fixed-satellite earth stations which often includes a larger hub station. For FY 1994, entities holding VSAT
authorizations will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with less than 100 antennas
will be subject to a minimum $6 fee.

40. 

Mobile Satellite Earth Stations.

 Under Part 25 of the Rules, mobile satellite service providers operate under blanket licenses for mobile antennas
(transceivers), which are smaller than one meter and provide voice or data communications, including position location
information, for mobile platforms such as cars, buses or trucks. For FY 1994, licensees will be assessed an annual
regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with fewer than 100 antennas will be subject to a minimum $6 fee.

41. 

Earth Station Antennas Less Than 9 Meters.

 Persons authorized or registered under Part 25 to operate fixed-satellite earth station antennas that are less than
9 meters in diameter are private and public carriers that provide telephone, television, data, and other forms of
communications. This category includes antennas used to transmit and receive, transmit only, or receive only. Also
included in this category are telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C) earth stations. For FY 1994, we will assess
an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per antenna. Entities with less than 100 antennas will be subject to a minimum $6 fee.

42. 

Earth Station Antennas 9 Meters or Greater.

 This category covers fixed-satellite earth station antennas authorized under Part 25 that are equal to or greater
than 9 meters in diameter. These earth stations are operated by private carriers and common carriers to provide telephone,
television, data, and other forms of communications. Included in this category are telemetry, tracking, and control
(TT&C) earth stations equal to or greater than 9 meters in diameter. For FY 1994, persons authorized to operate
transmit/receive and transmit-only antennas will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $85 per meter; receive-only
antennas will be assessed a regulatory fee of $55 per meter. All measurements will be to the tenth of a meter.



e. Interexchange and Local Exchange Carriers



43. For FY 1994, interexchange carriers (long distance telephone companies) (``IXCs'') will be assessed an annual
regulatory fee of $.06 per presubscribed line. Similarly, local exchange carriers (local telephone operating companies)
(``LECs'') will be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per access line. A holding company may combine the fee
payments of its operating companies and pay their fees for a particular service in a single combined payment or by installments,
if the aggregate of their fees in a single service qualifies the holding company to make installment payments. For
IXCs we have identified regulatory fee payment amounts greater than $500,000 as large. For LECs, we have identified
$700,000 as a large amount. Thus, we will permit IXCs whose annual regulatory fee exceeds $500,000 and LECs whose fee
payments exceed $700,000 to make installment payments.



f. Competitive Access Providers



44. Competitive access providers (``CAPs'') are companies, other than the traditional local telephone companies,
that provide interstate access services to long distance carriers and other companies. For FY 1994, each CAP will
be assessed an annual regulatory fee of $.06 per subscriber.



g. International Bearer Circuits



45. The Schedule of Regulatory Fees provides that the fee for international bearer circuits is to be computed ``per
100 active 64 KB circuits or equivalent.'' The fee is to be paid by the facilities-based common carrier activating
the circuit in any transmission facility for the provision of service to an end user or resale carrier. Private submarine
cable operators also are to pay fees for circuits sold on an indefeasible right of use (IRU) basis or leased in their
private submarine cables to any customer of the private cable operator. The fee is based upon active 64 KB circuits,
or equivalent circuits. Under this formulation, 64 KB circuits or their equivalent will be assessed a fee. Equivalent
circuits include the 64 KB circuit of larger bit stream circuits. For example, the 64 KB circuit equivalent of a 2.048
MB circuit is 30 64 KB circuits. Analog circuits such as 3 and 4 KHz circuits used for international service are also
included as equivalent 64 KB circuits. However, circuits derived from 64 KB circuits by the use of digital circuit
multiplication systems are not equivalent 64 KB circuits. Such circuits are not subject to fees. Only the 64 KB circuit
from which they have been derived will be subject to payment of a fee. For analog television channels we will assess
fees as follows:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rule makes final a proposed rule published on May 30, 1991 which proposed to amend title 24 of the Code of Federal
Regulations to create a new part 9, that would provide for the enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, as amended, in programs or activities conducted by HUD. The rule at 24 CFR part 9 is distinguished from the rule
at 24 CFR part 8, which applies to private, State or local programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance
from HUD. This final rule at 24 CFR part 9 establishes standards for what constitutes discrimination on the basis of
mental or physical disabilities; provides definitions for ``individuals with disabilities'' and ``qualified
individuals with disabilities''; establishes a complaint procedure for resolving allegations of discrimination;
and also incorporates additional changes to reflect regulatory implementation of the Americans with Disabilities
Act.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 





Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (section 504), states in pertinent part that: 

No otherwise qualified individual with disabilities in the United States, * * * shall, solely by reason
of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance 

or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service. The head
of each such agency shall promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendments to this section
made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed
regulation shall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of the Congress, and such regulation may take
effect no earlier than the thirtieth day after the date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.


(29 U.S.C. 794 (1978 amendment italicized)). 

On May 30, 1991 (56 FR 24604), HUD published a proposed rule that would amend title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations
to create a new 
part 9, that would provide for the enforcement of section 504 as it applies to programs or activities conducted by HUD
(i.e., HUD conducted programs or activities). The part 9 rule is distinguished from the rule at 24 CFR part 8, which
applies to private, State or local programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance from HUD (HUD assisted
programs or activities). However, the substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the agency as set forth in the
part 9 rule are adapted from, and are very similar to, those contained in the part 8 rule. (See 24 CFR part 8; see also 28
CFR part 41, which is the section 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs issued by the Department
of Justice (DOJ).) This general parallelism is in accord with the intent expressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment
in House floor debate, including its sponsor, U.S. Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Government should have
the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financial assistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks
of Rep. Jeffords); 124 Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) 

id.

; 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); 

id.

 at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).

There are, however, some differences between this part 9 rule and the DOJ section 504 coordination regulations for
federally assisted programs, as well as many other agencies' implementing regulations. Many of these changes are
based on the Supreme Court's decision in 

Southeastern Community College 

v. 

Davis, 

442 U.S. 397 (1979) [

Davis

], and the subsequent circuit court decisions interpreting 

Davis 

and section 504. These differences were discussed in detail in the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule at 56 FR 24604-24605.
There are also differences between the part 9 proposed rule and the part 9 final rule. These differences are discussed
in the following section. 


II. Differences Between Part 9 Proposed Rule and Part 9 Final Rule 




The Department invited public comment on the part 9 proposed rule. During the public comment period, which expired
July 29, 1991, the Department received seven comments. The commenters included: One state agency for the visually
impaired; a not-for-profit law firm that specializes in disability and health law; an organization representing
the interests of senior citizens; two legal service organizations; and two disability advocacy organizations.




Following careful consideration of the issues raised by the commenters, and further consideration of the part 9 rule
in light of regulatory implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub.L. 101-336, approved July
26, 1990) (ADA), the Department has decided to adopt the part 9 proposed rule substantially as published on May 30,
1991. However, the Department has made some changes to the proposed rule in response to certain issues raised by the
commenters, and in response to the final rules published on July 26, 1991, implementing titles I, II, and III of the
ADA, which address, respectively, equal employment opportunity for individuals with disabilities (title I); nondiscrimination
on the basis of disability in State and local government services (title II); and nondiscrimination on the basis of
disability by public accommodations and in commercial facilities (title III). (See 29 CFR part 1630, 56 FR 35726 (title
I); 28 CFR part 35, 56 FR 35694 (title II); and 28 CFR part 36, 56 FR 3544 (title III). 


A change in terminology that has been made in the part 9 final rule (and which also will be made to the rule in 24 CFR part
8) is replacement of the term ``handicap'' with ``disability.'' The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1992 (Pub.L. 102-569,
approved October 29, 1992) amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to replace ``handicap'' with ``disability.''




The additional changes made to the part 9 proposed rule by this final rule include the following. 



Applicable Accessibility Standards 




The final rule provides that HUD will follow the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), except where the
accessibility standards issued under the ADA provide for greater accessibility than the UFAS. The accessibility
standards issued under the ADA are referred to as the ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), and are set forth in appendix
A to 39 CFR part 1191. 



The UFAS implements the accessibility standards required by the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157)
(Barriers Act), and these standards are set forth in 24 CFR part 40, appendix A for residential structures, and in 41
CFR 101-19.600 to 101.607 for non-residential structures. 


The DOJ, by memorandum dated June 30, 1993, advised all Federal agencies that at a recent meeting, the ATBCB adopted
a resolution urging Federal agencies to follow the ADAAG whenever it provides equal or greater accessibility than
UFAS. The DOJ has requested that Federal agencies which have not issued their final rules implementing section 504
in Federally-conducted programs and activities comply with the ATBCB's request. The DOJ notes that from a legal point
of view, current section 504 regulations 
do not prohibit implementation of such a policy because the regulations do not require compliance with UFAS, but,
rather they simply state that compliance with UFAS is deemed to be compliance with section 504 new construction and
alteration requirements.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, this final rule provides that HUD will follow the ADAAG whenever it provides greater accessibility
than the UFAS. Additionally, the terms ``UFAS'' and ``ADAAG'' will be added to the definition section of the part 9
rule_ 9.103. 


Revised Definition of ``Accessible'' 


A minor revision is made to each of the definitions of 

accessible 

in  9.103. Each definition includes the phrase ``complies with applicable accessibility standards'' to clarify
that the design, construction or alteration undertaken must comply with applicable accessibility standards. 


Revised Definition of ``Accessible Route'' 


This final rule revises the definition of 

accessible route

. The definition of 

accessible route

 in the part 9 proposed rule was modeled on the definition of 

accessible route

 in 24 CFR part 8. However, on further consideration, the Department finds the part 8 definition to be too limited for
purposes of part 9. 
Part 8 applies solely to HUD-assisted programs. The majority of these programs are concerned with assisting individuals
and families to obtain decent and affordable housing by providing financial assistance (through rental subsidies
or for the development and operation of public housing), or by endorsing a mortgage on a house or the mortgage note on
a housing project (or both) for insurance. Thus, the part 8 definition of 

accessible 

route reflects part 8's focus on housing facilities. 

Part 9, however, applies to all programs or activities conducted by HUD. These programs and activities, as noted in
the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule (56 FR 24605), consist of the following: (1) Employment; (2) HUD's contact
with the general public as part of ongoing agency operations; and (3) those HUD programs directly administered by
HUD for program beneficiaries and participants. Activities within category 2 include communications with the public
(telephone contacts, office walk-ins or interviews) and the public's use of the agency facilities. Activities within
category (3) include programs that provide Federal services or benefits (e.g., housing facilities in HUD's Property
Disposition Program, training at both HUD and outside facilities, contracting and policy-development). These
activities involve many types of buildings and facilities, not just housing facilities. 
Accordingly, the definition of 

accessible route

 route in part 9 is revised by replacing it with the definition of 

accessible route

 route used in the ADAAG. The definition of 

accessible route

 route in the ADAAG includes examples of interior accessible route routes and exterior accessible route routes. 


Revised Definition of ``Adaptability'' 


The definition of adaptability is also revised by this final rule. The definition of 

adaptability 

in the proposed part 9 rule was based on the definition of adaptability in 24 CFR part 8. The part 8 definition is solely
concerned with adaptability in dwelling units, and, therefore, inappropriate for part 9, for the same reasons stated
under the discussion of the revised definition of 

accessible route

 route. Accordingly, the Department is adopting the definition of 

adaptability 

based on the definition of 

adaptability 

provided in the UFAS and ADAAG, which provide the same definition for this term. 
As revised in this final rule, adaptability will mean the ability of certain elements of a dwelling unit, such as kitchen
counters, sinks and grab bars, to be added or altered so as to accommodate the needs of individuals with or without disabilities
or to accommodate the needs of persons with different types or degrees of disability. This definition differs from
the definition in the part 9 proposed rule in that it refers to ``building spaces and elements'' instead of ``certain
elements of a dwelling unit.'' Both UFAS and ADAAG use the phrase ``building spaces and elements.'' 


Replacement of Definition of ``Agency-Owned Housing Facility'' With ``PDP Housing Facility'' 


The final rule replaces the term ``agency-owned housing facility'' with 

PDP housing facility. 

PDP refers to HUD's Property Disposition Program, and a definition is also included for this term. (See discussion
below.) Since the only HUD-owned housing facilities are those in the Property Disposition Program, the Department
believed use of the term ``PDP housing facility'' is a more accurate term.

Revised Definition of ``Alteration''



The part 9 final rule replaces the definition of 

alteration

 set forth in the May 30, 1991 proposed rule with that definition provided in the ADAAG. This definition is more detailed
and therefore provides more guidance on what constitutes, and what does not constitute, an alteration. 



Revised Definition of ``Facility''



The part 9 final rule also replaces the definition of 

facility

 in the May 30, 1991 proposed rule with that definition provided in the ADAAG. As with the definition of 

alteration,

 the ADAAG definition of 

facility

 is more detailed and therefore more helpful than the definition provided in the part 9 proposed rule. 



Revised Definition of ``Individual With Disabilities''



The definition of 

individual with disabilities

 (formerly, ``individual with handicaps'') is also revised by this rule. 

Paragraph (a), which defines the term ``physical and mental impairment'' is revised to include the human immunodeficiency
virus disease. 

A new paragraph (b) is added to this definition to incorporate the provisions of former  9.131 in the proposed
rule, which addressed applicability of section 504 to current and former illegal use of drugs. The DOJ and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which reviewed the part 9 rule in accordance with Executive Order 12067
(see Section IV of this 
preamble) suggested that the exclusion of individuals currently engaged in the illegal use of drugs from the protection
provided by section 504, and the inclusion of individuals undergoing, or having successfully completed, drug rehabilitation,
are more appropriately addressed in the definition of ``

individual with disabilities.''

 Section 9.131 of the proposed rule has been removed as a result of incorporation of its provisions in the definition
of 

individual with disabilities.

 
Former paragraph (b) (paragraph (b) in the part 9 proposed rule), which addressed impairments that are not included
in the definition of ``physical or mental impairment'' is redesignated as paragraph (c) in this final rule, and is
revised to address what is excluded from the definition of 

individual with disabilities

 for purposes of employment. 

In the part 9 proposed rule, paragraph (b) provided that the term ``physical or mental impairment'' did not include
(1) an individual who has a currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reasons of such disease or infection,
would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals, and (2) an individual who is an alcoholic
and whose current use of alcohol prevents the individual from performing the duties of the job in question. Although
these exclusions are appropriate for inclusion under the definition of 

individual with disabilities,

 they are not appropriate for inclusion in the definition of ``physical or mental impairment.'' 

Accordingly, new paragraph (c) of the definition of 

individual with disabilities

 clarifies that the contagious disease and alcohol abuse exclusions are part of the definition of ``individual of
disabilities'' and also clarifies that these exclusions are limited to the employment context, in accordance with
section 504 which imposes this limitation. 



New Definition for ``Property Disposition Program''



As noted above, the final rule provides a definition for this term. 

Property Disposition Program

 is defined to mean the HUD program under which HUD administers the group of housing facilities that are either owned
by the Secretary or where, even though the Secretary has not obtained title, the Secretary is mortgagee-in-possession.
Such properties are deemed to be in the possession or control of the agency. 



Direct Threat Standard_New  9.131 



The part 9 final rule adds a new  9.131 to implement section 302(b)(3) of the ADA, which addresses the issue of
``direct threat to the health or safety of others.'' Section  9.131 provides that the agency (HUD) is not required
to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages
and accommodations of the agency where the individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Section
9.131 is similar to  36.208 of the final rule implementing title III of the ADA, published on July 26, 1991 (56
FR 35544) and codified at 28 CFR part 36. New  9.131 is not intended to imply that individuals with disabilities
pose risks to others. It is intended to address concerns that may arise in this area, and to establish a strict standard
that must be met before denying service to an 

individual with disabilities

 or excluding that individual from participation in the programs or activities conducted by the agency. 

Paragraph (b) of this section defines ``direct threat'' to mean a significant risk to the health or safety of others
that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary
aids and services. This paragraph codifies the standard first applied by the Supreme Court in 

School Board of Nassau County 

v. 

Arline, 

480 U.S. 273 (1987), in which the Court held that an individual with a contagious disease may be an 

individual with disabilities

 under section 504. In 

Arline,

 the Supreme Court recognized that there is a need to balance the interests of people with disabilities against legitimate
concerns for public safety. Although individuals with disabilities are generally entitled to the protection of
part 9, a person who poses a significant risk to others may be excluded if reasonable modifications to the agency's
policies, practices, or procedures will not eliminate or reduce that risk (i.e., reduce it so that it is below the level
of direct threat). The determination that a person poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others may not be
based on generalizations or stereotypes about the effects of a particular disability. This determination must be
based on an assessment of that individual that conforms to the requirements of paragraph (c) of  9.131.

Paragraph (c) of  9.131 establishes the test to be used in determining whether an individual poses a direct threat
to the health or safety of others. The agency is required to make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable
judgment that relies on current medical evidence, or on the best available objective evidence to determine: the nature,
duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable
modifications of policies, practices or procedures will mitigate the risk. This is the test established by the Supreme
Court in 

Arline. 

This type of inquiry is essential if section 504 is to achieve its goal of protecting individuals with disabilities
from discrimination based on prejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear, while giving appropriate weight to legitimate
concerns, such as the need to avoid exposing others to significant health and safety risks. Making this assessment
will not usually require the services of a physician. Sources for medical knowledge include guidance from public
health authorities, such as the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Institutes
of Health, including the National Institute of Mental Health. 



Additional Changes 



In addition to the above changes, and as discussed in further detail in Section III of this preamble, the final rule
also revises  9.170, which concerns the part 9 compliance procedure. A hearing procedure is not mandated by
statute, and the Department has concluded that the compliance procedure set forth in  9.170 provides an adequate
remedy. Certain editorial changes were made to  9.152 to clarify the extent of the agency's responsibility
to modify existing housing. 



II. Discussion of Public Comments 



The revisions to the part 9 proposed rule discussed in section II above are further addressed in this section III, which
addresses the issues raised by the public commenters. 



Relationship of Section 504 to the Fair Housing Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act 





Comment. 

Six of the commenters stated that the part 9 proposed rule did not incorporate the standards and requirements that
appear in the Fair Housing Act
 or in title II of the ADA. Two commenters expressed concern that the part 9 rule proposes to implement less stringent
standards than the Fair Housing Act, and requested that the part 9 final rule conform to the Fair Housing Act requirements;
thus, eliminating any conflict in program regulations. Another commenter stated that the ADA requires HUD's regulations
to ``refer to the ADA so that when HUD assumes responsibility for housing enforcement under the public services section
(title II of the ADA), HUD will be better able to ensure consistency among all of its enforcement responsibilities.''








Response. 

As noted in the preamble discussion under Section II, which discusses changes made to the part 9 proposed rule, HUD
does, in several places in the final rule, incorporate the standards and requirements of the ADA. However, it is important
to note that in enacting the Fair Housing Act and the ADA, the Congress did not override the specific provisions of section
504. While all three statutes (the Fair Housing Act, the ADA, and section 504) provide certain civil rights protection
to individuals with disabilities, the scope and mandate of each statute is different. 

Section 504 is concerned with discrimination against individuals with disabilities in federally assisted and federally
conducted programs and activities. Federal programs or activities subject to section 504 include those in the areas
of employment, education, health, social services, housing and agency facilities. Under section 504, the mandate
that a federally assisted or conducted program or activity be ``accessible'' to individuals with disabilities does
not, in every case, require structural changes. Moreover, when compliance with the ``program accessibility'' of
section 504 does require structural changes, structural changes are not required to the same extent as required under
the Fair Housing Act. Under section 504, accessibility is defined in broader terms, as discussed in the preamble to
HUD's part 8 interim rule implementing section 504 for HUD assisted programs and activities: 

For example, even though a facility in which a federally assisted program is conducted is free of architectural barriers
and thus meets requirements for facility accessibility, the program is not accessible if management policies and
procedures effectively bar [individuals with disabilities] from participating in or otherwise benefiting from
the program or activity. On the other hand, a program which is conducted in an inaccessible existing facility can be
made accessible without altering the facility, where the program or activity can be delivered or otherwise be made
available to a [disabled] beneficiary without loss of essential program benefits. 






(

See

 preamble to part 8 interim rule published on May 6, 1983, 48 FR 20638 at 20640) 



The Fair Housing Act is concerned with discriminatory housing practices, and its provisions apply to all housing,
not just federally-assisted or federally-owned housing. The Fair Housing Act is also concerned with structural
accessibility. The Fair Housing Act establishes accessible design and construction requirements for certain new
multifamily dwellings for first occupancy on or after March 13, 1991. These requirements, however, do not extend
to existing facilities (i.e., alterations to existing facilities are not required). 

The ADA is concerned with discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of employment, public accommodations,
State and local government services, and telecommunications. With respect to structural accessibility, title
II of the ADA requires that newly constructed or newly altered State or local government facilities be designed and
constructed or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. (

See

 56 FR 35574.) 

The different mandates and scopes of section 504, the Fair Housing Act and the ADA limit the extent to which the regulations
promulgated under these statutes can be uniform. Additionally, HUD's section 504 regulations are subject to the
coordinating authority of the DOJ under Executive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298.) The purpose
of DOJ's coordinating authority is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, there is uniformity in the implementation
of section 504 by all Federal agencies. Accordingly, HUD's section 504 regulations are obliged to adhere, as closely
as possible, to DOJ's prototype section 504 regulations for these types of programs, and to such other guidance as
DOJ may provide in the issuance of section 504 regulations (for example, see the discussion concerning applicable
accessibility standards in Section II of the preamble).

With respect to any conflict among the requirements or the accessibility standards of section 504, the Fair Housing
Act and the ADA, and their respective regulations, HUD notes that an individual or entity that is subject to the provisions
(including regulatory provisions) of more than one of these statutes must comply with the provisions that provide
for the greater substantive rights or the more stringent accessibility standards. 



Definition of ``Accessible'' ( 9.103) 





Comment: 

Definition Requires Clarification. Two commenters stated that the definition of ``accessible'' in the part 9 proposed
rule lacks the specific guidance provided by the definition for this term in  100.201 of HUD's Fair Housing Act
regulations (24 CFR 100.201). One of the commenters stated that the part 9 definition of ``accessible'' with respect
to individual dwelling units requires that a unit be designed to meet the specific needs of a qualified individual's
particular disability or impairment. The commenter requested that HUD clarify that for a unit to be counted toward
a program's five percent requirement for accessible units, all the accessibility requirements for dwelling units,
as provided in 24 CFR part 40, must be met and not just those which might be adequate to meet the needs of the individual's
specific disability. 



Response. 

As discussed above, section 504 and the Fair Housing Act have different purposes. The Fair Housing Act's design and
construction accessibility standards apply only to certain new multifamily housing. Section 504 is concerned with
overall ``program'' accessibility, which includes accessibility standards for multifamily housing and other
types of facilities, including Federal Government buildings. Additionally, the Fair Housing Act, unlike section
504, does not impose accessibility standards on alterations to existing housing and facilities. Accordingly, the
definition of ``accessible'' in HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations is not sufficiently broad for section 504 purposes.
However, as noted in Section II of this preamble, which discusses changes made to the proposed rule, the Department
did make some modification to the definitions of ``accessible'' for purposes of clarity. 

With respect to the question of whether an individual dwelling unit, that is altered to be accessible to a qualified
individual with a specific disability, counts toward the program's five percent requirement, the Department notes
that this issue is addressed by  9.152 of the rule. Section 9.152 provides that if HUD undertakes alterations
to a PDP multifamily housing project, that is subject to the accessibility requirements of  9.152, a minimum
of five percent of the total dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, must be made accessible for
persons with 

mobility

 impairments. (Emphasis added.) Section 9.152 also provides that if the unit is on an accessible route and is adaptable
and otherwise in compliance with  9.152(d) (which requires compliance with the definitions, requirements
and standards of the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility) the unit is accessible for purposes
of  9.152. Section 9.152 further provides that an additional two percent of the units (but not less than one unit)
in the project must be made accessible for persons with 

hearing or vision impairments. 

(Emphasis added.) Thus, whether an individual dwelling unit, which is altered for a specific qualified individual
with disabilities, counts toward the program's five percent or two percent requirement depends upon the nature of
the alterations undertaken to address the individual's disability. 



Definition of ``Accessible Route'' ( 9.103) 





Comment: 

Definition Lacks Specific Guidance. Two commenters stated that the definition of ``accessible route'' as set forth
in HUD's Fair Housing regulations provides more guidance than the definition in the part 9 proposed rule, and urged
the Department to adopt the definition in the Fair Housing Act regulation. 



Response. 

As discussed in the previous response, the differences between the mandate and scope of the Fair Housing Act and the
mandate and scope of section 504 render the definition of ``accessible route'' in HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations
inappropriate for section 504 purposes. However, as noted in section II of this preamble, the Department has revised
the definition of ``accessible route'' to require compliance with the ADAAG. The Department believes that the ADAAG
definition of ``accessible route'' provides more guidance than the definition of ``accessible route'' in the part
9 proposed rule, and should address the commenters' concerns. 



Comment: 

Definition Should Reference Architectural Barriers Act. One commenter stated that the definitions of ``accessible,''
``accessible route,'' and ``adaptability'' should reference the Barriers Act, which imposes access requirements
on all HUD-owned, leased, and managed properties. 



Response. 

As discussed in section II of this preamble, the definitions of ``accessible route'' and ``adaptability'' were revised
in this final rule to adopt the standards of the ADAAG or UFAS, as applicable. Also,   9.151 and 9.152 of
the proposed rule, and of this final rule, which establish the requirements for new construction and alterations
to existing facilities, provide that the definitions, requirements, and standards of the UFAS apply to facilities
covered by this rule, except where the ADAAG may provide for greater accessibility. 



Comment: 

Definition Should Provide Accessibility For Persons Who Are Hearing and Sight Impaired. One commenter stated that
the definition of ``accessible route'' in the part 9 rule provides that ``an accessible route that serves only accessible
units occupied by persons with hearing or vision impairments would not be required to comply with those requirements
intended to effect accessibility for persons with mobility impairments.'' The commenter requested that HUD revise
this definition to include persons who are visually impaired, blind, or deaf and blind. The commenter stated that
moving about safely in one's environment can be a major obstacle to independent living for individuals with these
disabilities.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response. 

HUD agrees with the commenter and believes that the revision made to the definition of ``accessible route'' by this
final rule, which is to adopt the ADAAG definition of ``accessible route,'' addresses the commenter's concern. 



Definition of ``Adaptability'' ( 9.103) 





Comment: 

HUD Should Adopt the Definition of Adaptability Used in Fair Housing Regulations. Two commenters urged the Department
to adopt the definition of ``adaptability'' in the Fair Housing Act regulations (24 CFR 100.205), and stated that
the part 9 rule should not use a different definition than that contained in the Fair Housing Act regulations. 



Response. 

The more explicit description of ``adaptability'' in the Fair Housing Act regulations results from the fact that
the statutory language of the Fair Housing Act is explicit as to what constitutes accessibility and adaptability
under the Act. The language in  100.205(c) of HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations is taken directly from section
804(f)(3)(C) of the Fair Housing Act. However, the features of adaptable design and construction described in  100.205(c)
do not include all the features that may be required under part 9. For example, the accessibility/adaptability requirements
of the Fair Housing Act do not require adjustable cabinetry, fixtures and plumbing. (

See

 discussion of this issue in the preamble to the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines codified at 24 CFR, Ch. I, Subch.
A, App. III.) Additionally, the Fair Housing Act does not require accessible/adaptable features for individuals
with hearing or vision impairments. The section 504 definition of ``adaptability'' includes adjustable cabinetry
and fixtures, and design features for persons with impaired hearing and vision. Thus, the Fair Housing Act definition
of adaptability, which is directed largely to individuals with mobility impairments, is inappropriate for section
504 purposes. 



Definition of ``Auxiliary Aids'' ( 9.103) 





Comment: 

Definition Should Include Devices for Persons With Impaired Cognitive Skills. Two commenters stated that the definition
of ``auxiliary aids'' in the part 9 rule limits these aids to persons with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills.
The commenters stated that auxiliary aids and services should not exclude individuals with mental disabilities,
and suggested that the definition be revised as follows: ``Auxiliary aids means services or devices that enable persons
with impaired sensory, manual, cognitive, interpersonal, or speaking skills to have equal opportunity . . . .''




Response. 

HUD's definition of auxiliary aids and services is consistent with the DOJ's definition for these terms. The DOJ interprets
auxiliary aids and services as those aids and services designed to provide effective communication, e.g., making
aurally and visually delivered information available to persons with hearing, speech and vision impairments. This
interpretation was recently reiterated in DOJ's final rules implementing title II and title III of the ADA. (

See

 28 CFR part 35 (title II); and 28 CFR part 36 (title III); see, especially discussion in preamble to title III final rule
at 56 FR 35565). To the extent that individuals with cognitive or learning disabilities have impaired sensory, manual,
or communication skills, these individuals are covered by the definition of auxiliary aids and services. 



Definition of ``Individuals With Disabilities'' ( 9.103) 





Comment: 

Definition Omits the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Four commenters stated that the definition for ``individuals
with disabilities'' in the part 9 rule omits from the list of physical and mental impairments the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). The commenters stated that it is important to clarify that individuals who test positive for the HIV are
covered because subsection (b) of the definition for ``individuals with disabilities'' excludes individuals who
currently have contagious diseases and who pose a direct health and safety threat to others, or who, by reasons of the
disease, cannot perform the duties of the job.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 As noted in section II of this preamble, HUD has revised the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' in the
final rule to clarify that persons with the human immunodeficiency virus disease (symptomatic or asymptomatic)
are covered. 


Comment:

 Direct Threat Standard Excludes Reasonable Accommodation Requirement. One commenter stated that the ``direct
threat to the health or safety of others'' exclusion derives from the case of 

School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,

 107 S.Ct. 1123 (1987), but fails to include the essential caveat that ``the direct threat not be capable of elimination
by reasonable accommodation''. The commenter stated that the Congress, in its discussion of this direct threat exclusion
in the legislative history of the Fair Housing Act, was careful to note the reasonable accommodation requirement.
The commenter requested that the reasonable accommodation requirement be explicitly acknowledged in the part 9
final rule. 


Response.

 As discussed in section II of this preamble, the Department has added a new  9.131 to address the issue of ``direct
threat to the health or safety of others.'' This new section provides that the agency must determine whether reasonable
modifications of its policies, practices or procedures will mitigate the risk posed by the individual determined
to present a direct threat to the health or safety of others. Although the commenter uses the term ``reasonable accommodation,''
which is the appropriate term within the context of the Fair Housing Act, the appropriate comparable term for section
504, generally, is ``reasonable modification,'' which reflects section 504's application to a broader range of
programs and activities. However, reference to reasonable accommodation is appropriate when discussing section
504's application to the employment. 


Comment:

 Delete Reference to ``Inability to Perform the Essential Elements of Job or Activity.'' One commenter stated that
the exclusion from the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' of the following phrase_``persons with
a contagious disease who are unable to perform the duties of the job''_was unwarranted. The commenter stated that
inquiries as to whether an individual with disabilities is able to perform the duties of a job or activity are relevant
only with respect to whether the individual is ``qualified''_and then only if the individual is unable to perform
the essential duties, not all duties, of the job or activity. The commenter stated that reasonable accommodation
must be provided, if necessary, to assist the individual in performing the essential duties. The commenter further
stated: ``Because this subsection involves the definition of `individual with disabilities,' rather than `qualified
individual with disabilities,' the reference to inability to perform the duties of job should be deleted.'' 


Response.

 The Department agrees with the commenter's statement that without reference to the essential duties and reasonable
accommodation aspects of the analysis, this particular provision of the definition is misleading. Accordingly,
the Department has revised paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of the definition of ``individuals with disabilities'' to include
the following language: ``An individual * * * is unable to perform the essential duties of the job,
with or without reasonable accommodation.'' 



Definition of ``Multifamily Housing Project'' ( 9.103) 




Comment:

 Multifamily Dwellings Covered by Section 504 Should Be the Same as Those Covered by the Fair Housing Act. Three commenters
noted that the part 9 rule defined ``multifamily housing project'' to mean ``a project 
containing five or more dwelling units,'' while the Fair Housing regulations define covered multifamily dwellings
to mean buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units, if such buildings have one or more elevators, and ground
floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units. The commenters stated that the dwellings covered
by the section 504 regulations should mirror those of the Fair Housing Act. 


Response.

 The definition of ``covered multifamily dwelling'' found in the Fair Housing Act regulations is consistent with
the definition of this term in the Fair Housing Act. The definition of ``multifamily housing project'' in the part
9 rule is consistent with the definition of this term in section 207(c) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1713),
and is the definition with which HUD program participants are familiar. The definition is also consistent with HUD's
section 504 regulations for federally assisted activities. (

See

 24 CFR 8.3) Since section 504 extends only to federally assisted and federally conducted programs and activities,
the Department believes that the definition of multifamily housing project, as set forth in the National Housing
Act, which pertains to Federal housing programs, is the appropriate definition for HUD's section 504 regulations.



Comment:

 All HUD Housing Should Be Covered by Section 504, Including Single Family Homes. One commenter stated that the occupancy
classification provision of the UFAS defines multifamily housing as apartment buildings, without reference to
a number of units, and the residential section of the UFAS occupancy classification refers to one and two family dwellings.
The commenter stated that the inclusion of the classification of one and two family dwellings in the UFAS indicates
that these dwellings are also subject to the Barriers Act. The commenter requested that HUD make all of its housing,
including single family homes, subject to the requirements of the Barriers Act. 


Response.

 The fact that the UFAS contains provisions applicable to one or two family dwellings is not determinative of whether
one or two family dwellings are subject to the requirements of the Barriers Act. Whether one or two family dwellings
are covered by the Barriers Act depends upon whether a statute subjects these types of dwellings to the requirements
of Barriers Act. One or two family dwellings are subject to the requirements of section 504, and possibly the UFAS,
to the extent that they are part of a HUD conducted program and meet the requirements of 24 CFR 9.150(e).

Definition of ``Qualified Individuals With Disabilities'' ( 9.103) 




Comment:

 Eliminate Definition. Five commenters stated that the definition for ``qualified individuals with disabilities''
should be removed from the part 9 rule. One commenter stated that HUD concedes in the preamble to the proposed part 9
rule that housing programs do not require a definition of qualified individual with disabilities (56 FR 24606). The
commenter stated that HUD included this definition so that the part 9 rule will cover all programs or activities conducted
by HUD now and in the future, and so that HUD's regulation will be consistent with the DOJ's prototype regulation and
the regulations of other Federal agencies (56 FR 24606). The commenter stated that HUD could achieve its purpose through
other ways, such as explicitly describing the HUD programs or the kinds of HUD programs to which the definition applies,
or explaining that this term does not apply to housing consumers. 


Response.

 The term ``qualified individual with disabilities'' is taken directly from the language of section 504. The protection
afforded by section 504 is restricted to ``qualified'' individuals with disabilities. As noted in the preamble to
the part 9 proposed rule, HUD does not conduct programs under which a person is required to perform services or achieve
a level of accomplishment as a part of his or her participation in a particular program or activity (e.g., educational
programs) (56 FR 24606). Notwithstanding this fact, HUD determined, as also noted in the preamble to the part 9 proposed
rule, that it is important to include a definition for this term so that HUD's regulation will cover all programs or
activities conducted by HUD now and in the future, and so that its section 504 regulation for federally conducted programs
will be consistent with DOJ's prototype regulation. However, the fact that section 504 applies only to ``qualified
individuals with disabilities'' makes it important to include a definition for this term in HUD's section 504 regulations.

The purpose in defining the term ``qualified individuals with disabilities'' is to establish a uniform standard
by which an individual with disabilities is determined to be ``qualified'' to participate in a federally assisted
or federally conducted program. The standard, as established by DOJ on the basis of Federal case law concerning section
504, is whether, with appropriate modifications, an individual with disabilities is able to participate in, or achieve
the purpose of a federally assisted or federally conducted program or activity. To be considered qualified, however,
the modifications required for the individual with disabilities may not be those which would result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the program. (

See

 preamble to DOJ's coordination regulation for federally conducted programs codified at 28 CFR part 39, Editorial
Note, 415-429 (1991) at 418; and preamble to proposed part 9 rule at 56 FR 24606.) HUD's definition of ``qualified
individuals with disabilities'' incorporates this basic test established by DOJ and Federal case law and is consistent
with the DOJ's definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' in its section 504 prototype regulation
for federally conducted programs. 


Comment: Eliminate Language Concerning Essential Eligibility Requirements 

Five commenters objected to the language concerning ``essential eligibility requirements'' set forth in paragraph
(b) of the definition. One commenter stated that the essential eligibility requirement language included ``implicit''
eligibility requirements. 


Response.

 In defining ``qualified individual with disabilities,'' HUD adheres to DOJ's guidance on the meaning and interpretation
of this term, which guidance is set forth in DOJ's preamble to the final rule implementing its section 504 prototype
regulation for federally conducted programs, codified at 28 CFR part 39, Editorial Note, 415-429 (1991). In
this preamble, DOJ advises that the concept of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' includes the notion of
``essential eligibility requirements''. 
(

Id

 at 419). Under section 504, a qualified individual with disabilities must be able to meet the essential eligibility
requirements of a federally assisted or federally conducted program, with the recognition that reasonable modification
may need to be made to the program for the individual with disabilities to meet the essential eligibility requirements
of the program. 
The inclusion of the term ``implicit requirements'' in the definition is to clarify that the essential eligibility
requirements do not include only stated program eligibility requirements, but also those requirements that are
inherent in the nature of the program. However, in including implicit requirements in the definition, HUD does not
intend a program's eligibility requirements to include requirements that are not intrinsic to the program or that
are applied solely to individuals with disabilities_and not to other tenants. 


Comment: 

``All Obligations of Occupancy'' Are Not Essential. One commenter stated that the ``essential eligibility requirements''
include the requirement to comply with ``all obligations of occupancy.'' The commenter stated that all obligations
of occupancy cannot possibly be essential. The commenter stated: ``Rather than clarifying the obligations of program
operators under section 504, this definition will mislead operators into believing that they can exclude any individual
with disabilities who cannot fully satisfy every term of the lease, however incidental or unimportant.'' 

Response.

 The phrase ``all obligations of occupancy,'' as with the phrase ``implicit eligibility requirements'' discussed
above, is intended to refer only to those requirements or obligations that are imposed on all tenants or residents,
regardless of whether the tenants or residents are individuals with disabilities. The Department believes that
it is important to retain the phrase ``all obligations of occupancy'' within the definition of ``qualified individual
with disabilities'' because it is embodied in the concept of ``essential eligibility requirements''. To be eligible
to participate in a HUD housing program, an applicant must be able to comply with all obligations of occupancy. Typical
occupancy obligations include those related to rent, security deposits, use of premises, subletting, and utility
charges. It is inappropriate for the Department to list in a regulation which obligations constitute ``important''
obligations of occupancy, because of the difficulty in ensuring the comprehensiveness of such a list, and because
certain multifamily housing projects as a result of their location or use may require the inclusion of obligations
(or terms) that are not generally found in leases for other multifamily housing projects. For the foregoing reasons,
the Department declines to state which obligations of occupancy are those with which an individual with disabilities
must comply. 


Comment:

 Definition Fails to Note the Obligation of HUD to Provide Reasonable Accommodations. Two commenters stated that
the definition fails to note the obligation of HUD to provide reasonable accommodation to individuals who would be
able to satisfy essential program requirements with such assistance. 


Response.

 HUD's definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' is consistent with the definition for this term
found in DOJ's section 504 prototype regulation for federally conducted programs and in the section 504 regulations
of other Federal agencies. The fact that the definition of qualified individual with disabilities does not explicitly
refer to the ``reasonable modification'' requirement does not mean that the requirement is inapplicable to Federal
programs covered by section 504. As noted earlier in this preamble, reasonable modification is required under section
504. The reasonable modification requirement, although not explicitly referred to in the definition of ``qualified
individual with disabilities,'' is referred to in the definition of ``individual with disabilities'' and is implicitly
referenced in the language of the definition of ``qualified individual with disabilities'' that provides that modifications
in the program or activity, which result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program, are not required.
Conversely, modifications to the program that would not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program
are required.

Comment:

 Definition Should Include Direct Threat Standard and Eliminate Standard of Significant Risk of Substantial Interference
with the Safety of Others. Five commenters supported incorporating the ``direct threat'' standard that is included
in the Fair Housing Act, rather than the standard of ``significant risk of substantial interference with the safety
or enjoyment of others or with his own health or safety,'' as set forth in the part 9 rule. One commenter stated that it
was absolutely improper to permit evaluation of whether an individual is a potential risk to his or her own health or
safety. The commenter stated that: ``In the housing context, such a concern can never be related to an essential eligibility
requirement. Where an individual may pose a risk to him or herself and to others, the Fair Housing Act standard of direct
threat to the health and safety of others is adequate.'' 



Response.

 As discussed in section II of this preamble, the Department has added a new  9.131, which addresses the direct
threat standard. 



Self-Evaluation ( 9.110) 



Section 9.110(a) provides that HUD shall, within one year of the effective date of the part 9 final rule, evaluate its
current policies and practices, and the effects of those policies and practices, including regulations, handbooks,
notices and other written guidance, that do not or may not meet the requirements of part 9, and, to the extent modification
of any such policies is required, HUD shall take the necessary corrective actions. 



Comment:

 Self-Evaluation Section Should Be Delayed by Final Rule Deadlines. Two commenters suggested that this section be
revised to state that remedial actions, which HUD has begun or is planning, will not be delayed by the ``deadlines in
this section.'' One of the commenters stated that the part 9 final rule should clearly state that HUD will complete
the self-evaluation of its policies and practices within one year of the effective date of the final rule. 



Response.

 The Department periodically reviews the requirements of its various programs, and the policies and practices of
these programs, to ensure that all HUD programs, both HUD assisted and HUD conducted, reflect existing statutory
requirements. Given this periodic review process, the Department does not intend or foresee any delay in the evaluation
of HUD 
conducted programs to ensure that these programs meet the requirements of part 9, as required by  9.110. 



Comment:

 HUD Should Review Its Federal Preference Criteria, As Part of Its Self-Evaluation Process. One commenter urged the
Department to review its Federal preference criteria for housing programs funded by the Department. The commenter
stated that the current criteria are not clear on the definition of what is not a ``regular sleeping accommodation''
and that Federal preferences should be revised to give top preference to individuals released from institutions,
such as hospitals, nursing homes and rehabilitation facilities. 



Response.

 A review of Federal preference criteria for housing programs is not appropriate in connection with the development
and implementation of this part 9 rule. This rule is concerned with the implementation of section 504 solely as it applies
to HUD conducted programs. Federal preferences in housing affect all HUD housing programs, not only housing owned
by HUD. Any changes to the list of individuals that should be given preferences in federally-assisted or federally-conducted
housing is more appropriate for proposed rulemaking that provides for advance notice to, and solicitation of comment
from, the public. 



Comment:

 Expand Public Participation in the Self-Evaluation Process to Include Comments on Fair Housing Issues. Section
9.110(b) of the part 9 rule provides that HUD shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals
with disabilities or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the self-evaluation
process by submitting comments, both oral and written. One commenter recommended that HUD expand this section of
the self-evaluation process to include fair housing issues that relate to people with disabilities. 



Response.

 As discussed throughout this preamble, the mandate and the scope of the Fair Housing Act and section 504 are different.
Accordingly, it is inappropriate for issues specifically related to the Fair Housing Act to be included in the section
504 self-evaluation process. However, to the extent that section 504 incorporates or overlaps with the Fair Housing
Act, these issues may be raised in connection with the self-evaluation process. 



Comment:

 Files Should Be Maintained Permanently. Section 9.110(c) of the part 9 rule provides that HUD shall, for a period of
at least three years following the completion of the self-evaluation, maintain on file and make available for public
inspection: (1) A list of interested persons; 
(2) a description of the areas examined and any problems identified; and 
(3) a description of any modifications made or to be made. Two commenters recommended that HUD maintain this file permanently.
The commenters stated that HUD may make progress in the implementation and enforcement of section 504 if HUD's efforts
are permanently catalogued, and that this progress is more important than maintaining consistency with the DOJ's
coordination regulation. 



Response.

 The Department believes that successful implementation and enforcement of section 504 will not be hindered by the
rule's requirement to maintain the ``self-evaluation'' files for a period of three years. The Department notes that
under  9.110, HUD is not required to discard the self-evaluation files after the three year period has expired.
Rather, HUD is required to maintain these files for a period of at least three years following the completion of the
self-evaluation. HUD may maintain these files permanently or indefinitely. Accordingly, the Department believes
that the minimum three-year requirement is sufficient.

Notice ( 9.111) 





Comment:

 This Section Should Clarify How HUD Will Communicate with People with Disabilities. Section 9.111 provides that
HUD shall make available to employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons,
information regarding the provisions of part 9. One commenter stated that although the preamble to the part 9 proposed
rule indicated that certain HUD materials will be made available on tape and in Braille, nothing in the regulation
makes that clear. The commenter requested that the part 9 proposed rule describe the specific ways in which HUD will
communicate effectively with applicants, participants, personnel or other Federal entities, and members of the
public who have disabilities. 



Response.

 To make available to individuals with disabilities the information required by  9.111, HUD will use, to the
extent necessary, the auxiliary aids and services described in  9.103. The definition of ``auxiliary aids''
in  9.103 provides in relevant part as follows: ``Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by  9.160(a)(1),
they may also be necessary to meet other requirements of the proposed regulation.'' 



General Prohibitions Against Discrimination ( 9.130) 



Section 9.130 lists the general prohibitions against discrimination under section 504. Subsection (b)(vi) of  9.130
states that it is discriminatory to: 

``Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a disability of that buyer or renter or a person
residing or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available.'' ( 9.130(b)(vi))




Comment:

  9.130 Should Include Relatives, Friends and Associates of Individuals with Disabilities. Three commenters
stated that this paragraph was similar to language in the Fair Housing Act, except that the Fair Housing Act adds a third
category of discrimination_``or because of a disability of any person associated with that person.'' The commenters
urged adoption of this category of individuals so that the section 504 regulations, like the Fair Housing regulations
(24 CFR 100.202), will prohibit discrimination against buyers and renters who have relatives, friends or associates
who have disabilities. 



Response.

 The Fair Housing Act prohibits, 

inter alia,

 discrimination against any person on the basis of disability, whether or not it is the aggrieved person or an associate
or relative of that person who is disabled. 
Because of differences in the language and structure of the Fair Housing Act and section 504, the Fair Housing Act language
is not necessarily transferable to section 504. 



Comment:

 This Section Should Incorporate Language Concerning Reasonable Accommodation. One commenter requested that HUD
incorporate the language of  100.204 of the Fair Housing Act regulations concerning reasonable accommodation
in the part 9 rule's provision establishing the general prohibitions against discrimination under section 504.




Response.

 HUD's Fair Housing Act regulation concerning reasonable accommodation is not appropriate for the section 504 regulations.
The reasonable accommodation requirements of the Fair Housing Act are narrower than the ``reasonable modification''
requirements of section 504, because the Fair Housing Act requirements only refer to reasonable modifications and
the rules, policies, practices or services associated with a dwelling unit. (

See

 24 CFR 100.204.) Under section 504, reasonable modifications will vary in the context of each Federal program or activity.
Accordingly, it is important that the interpretation of reasonable modification with respect to a program or activity
covered by section 504 not be limited to the interpretation provided by HUD's Fair Housing Act regulations. Additionally,
as noted previously, the term, ``qualified individuals with disabilities,'' used throughout the part 8 and part
9 rules implicitly incorporates the concept of reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification.

Program Accessibility: Existing Facilities ( 9.150) 





Comment:

 The Department Should Consider the Impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act on Existing Facilities. Section
9.150(b) provides that HUD is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods
are effective in achieving compliance with this section. Three commenters stated that HUD should consider the impact
of the ADA on HUD programs and activities. Two commenters stated that it would be helpful both to consumers and to HUD
and Justice enforcement personnel if these regulations referred to the ADA and to the ADA title II regulations and
standards. 



Response.

 In developing this final rule, the Department in consultation with the DOJ and EEOC, has considered the impact of the
ADA on HUD conducted programs and activities, and where appropriate, incorporated those requirements of the ADA
that are applicable to these programs and activities. 



Comment:

 Section 9.150(e) Should Clarify HUD's Responsibility to Make Reasonable Modifications in Housing Sold to Buyers
with Disabilities. Section 9.150(e) provides that HUD is not required to make alterations to existing facilities
that are part of HUD's Property Disposition Programs, unless such alterations are necessary to meet the needs of a
current or prospective tenant during the time when the Department expects to retain legal possession of the facilities
and there is no alternative method to meet the needs of that tenant. Section 9.150(e) further provides that nothing
in this section shall be construed to require alterations to make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities
who are expected to occupy the facilities only after HUD relinquishes legal possession. 

One commenter stated that this section relieves HUD of all responsibility to make any modifications for buyers with
disabilities who purchase housing through HUD's Property Disposition Program. The commenter stated that  9.150(e)
should be revised to clarify HUD'S responsibility to make reasonable modifications in housing sold to buyers with
disabilities. 

Another commenter stated that the part 9 final rule should be revised to provide that HUD will exert its best efforts
to assist a purchaser in obtaining the funding and expertise that HUD is able to provide in making the building usable
for tenants and owners with disabilities. 



Response.

 Section 9.150 requires the housing provider to demonstrate that physical alterations to make a unit accessible would
result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the program or activity or in an undue financial and administrative
burden. This section requires that where physical alterations would result in a fundamental alteration or undue
financial and administrative burden, alternative action must be taken that would not result in such an alteration
or such burdens, but nevertheless would ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services
of the program or activity. 

In the preamble to the part 9 proposed rule, HUD explained why the traditional approach to program accessibility with
respect to existing facilities is not appropriate for the Property Disposition Programs because HUD holds the properties
only temporarily and for an unpredictable amount of time (56 FR 24611). Since HUD does not know how long it will be in
possession of the property, the agency cannot identify a time period within which it can assess the needs of those who
might wish to live there in the future. However, HUD recognizes that during the time that the agency retains possession
of a housing property under this program, HUD provides a housing service to the residents and also has a section 504
obligation to those who apply for housing in the facility. 



Program Accessibility: Alterations of Property Disposition Program Multifamily Housing Facilities ( 9.152)




Section 9.152 imposes accessibility requirements on HUD when HUD undertakes alterations to multifamily housing
facilities that are part of HUD's Property Disposition Program. This section would require that once HUD undertakes
alterations that cost 75 percent or more of the replacement value of the building, HUD must make at least five percent
of the units accessible to tenants with mobility disabilities and two percent of the units accessible to tenants with
sight and hearing disabilities. 



Comment:

 Section 9.152 Should Include the Fair Housing Act Standards for New Construction. One commenter stated that HUD adopted
the 75 percent figure for its section 504 federally assisted regulations, because it purposely wanted the level of
alterations to ``be tantamount to new construction'' (53 FR 20224). The commenter stated that the Department is now
required to meet the Fair Housing Act new construction standards when altering housing facilities. The commenter
further stated that this section requires the five percent/two percent standard only in buildings with 15 or more
units that are undergoing significant alteration, and that this requirement conflicts with HUD's UFAS standards
for federally owned residential property which has no minimum 15 unit requirement. 



Response.

 As previously discussed, it is inappropriate for HUD to incorporate the standards and requirements of the Fair Housing
Act in a regulation implementing section 504 because the purposes and goals of these two statutes are not identical.
To the extent that newly constructed HUD multifamily housing is subject to the requirements of the Fair Housing Act
and section 504, HUD will adhere to the standards that provide for greater accessibility. 

The UFAS standards were promulgated under the Barriers Act. (

See

 24 CFR part 40, App. A, 4.1; 49 FR 31528; 53 FR 20228.) Because section 504 requires compliance with accessibility standards
in certain circumstances, the DOJ recommended that Federal agencies provide that new construction and alterations
comply with the ADAAG or the UFAS (that is, compliance with the ADAAG whenever the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility
than the UFAS). Compliance with the UFAS or the ADAAG therefore is deemed to be compliance with section 504. The DOJ
recommended the UFAS and the ADAAG as the applicable accessibility standards for section 504 to reduce potential
conflict between standards enforced under the Barriers Act and section 504. However, the degree of accessibility
required by the Barriers Act and that required by section 504 are not identical, and the regulations and standards
promulgated under section 504 and the Barriers Act reflect these differences. 



Comment:

 Replacement Cost Cap of Section 9.152 Should Be Lowered from 75 percent to 50 percent. One commenter recommended lowering
the replacement cost cap in  9.152 because many states and cities nationwide have a lower triggering percentage.
The commenter stated that HUD projects should not be allowed to remain inaccessible until a renovation totals 75 percent
of replacement cost when private buildings are subject to a more stringent standard. 



Response.

 The 75 percent replacement cost cap set forth in  9.152 is also contained in  8.23 of HUD's section 504 regulation
for HUD assisted programs. The replacement cost cap issue was carefully considered by the Department during development
of the final part 8 rule. The Department received 290 comments on this issue following publication of the proposed
part 8 rule (53 FR 20224). In the preamble to the final part 8 rule, the Department explained in detail the reasons behind
its decision to retain the 75 percent replacement cost cap. (

See

 53 FR 20224.) The comment made by the commenter on this issue in the context of the part 9 rule has not persuaded the Department
to revise its initial decision that the 75 percent replacement cost cap is an appropriate standard for section 504
purposes. The Department points out, however, that HUD projects in jurisdictions which impose more stringent accessibility
standards, than those prescribed in HUD's section 504 regulations, must comply with the more stringent requirements.




Comment:

 Section 9.152(b) is Unclear As to When Responsibility to Modify Existing Housing Ends. One commenter stated that
paragraph (b) of 
 9.152 is confusing. The commenter stated that housing providers who read the regulation do not understand
when their responsibility to modify existing housing ends. The commenter stated that paragraph (b) should be revised
to clarify that each time a building is altered, accessibility requirements apply.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00095 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response.

 The Department believes that part of the confusion concerning  9.152 results from the fact that the subheadings
were inadvertently omitted at the time of publication of the part 9 proposed rule. Paragraph (a) of  9.152 should
be titled ``Substantial Alterations,'' and paragraph (b) of this section should be titled ``Other Alterations.''
The final rule includes these subheadings which indicates the extent of the provider's responsibility to modify
existing housing. The Department believes that no further revisions to this section are necessary. The issue raised
by the commenter, like the issue in the preceding comment, was the subject of considerable public comment at the time
of publication of the proposed part 8 rule. (

See

 24 CFR 20224.) The Department believes that the lack of substantial public comment on  9.152(b), which is identical
to  8.23(b), indicates that the provisions of this section are not confusing for the majority of HUD program
participants. Accordingly, except for the inclusion of the subheadings, the Department declines to amend the language
in this section. 



Distribution of Accessible Dwelling Units ( 9.153) 



This section requires accessible units to be distributed throughout projects ``to the maximum extent feasible and
subject to reasonable health and safety requirements''. 



Comment:

 Eliminate Language Concerning ``To the Maximum Extent Feasible''. Two commenters recommended that the Department
delete the language beginning ``to the maximum extent feasible.'' The commenters stated that the Fair Housing Act
prohibits segregating all tenants with disabilities into one area or into one part of a building. 



Response.

 The language in  9.153 is identical to the language in 
 8.26 of HUD's section 504 regulation for federally assisted programs. Section 8.26 was the subject of considerable
public comment following publication of the part 8 proposed rule. (

See

 53 FR 20226.) The commenters on the part 8 rule expressed concerns similar to those expressed by the commenters on this
rule. In the preamble to the part 8 proposed rule, the Department stated that this provision does not allow ``the unnecessary
segregation of qualified individuals with disabilities'' (53 FR 20226). The Department reaffirms that prohibition
here, and notes that this prohibition is contained in  9.130(b)(1)(iv), which prohibits the agency from providing
different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities, or to any class of individuals
with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with
disabilities with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others. 



Occupancy of Accessible Dwelling Units ( 9.154) 



Section 9.154(b) provides that when offering an accessible unit to an applicant who is not disabled and does not require
the accessibility features of the unit, the Department may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this
agreement in the lease) to move to a non-accessible unit when available. 



Comment:

 Department Should Require All Leases to Incorporate ``Agreement to Move'' Clause as Standard Practice. One commenter
recommended that the Department incorporate this provision in the lease as standard practice. 



Response.

 The Department believes that it is unnecessary to require 
that this provision be incorporated in the lease as standard practice. The Department believes that the language
in  9.154, which provides that this provision may be incorporated in the lease is adequate. The Department notes
that this language was contained in  8.26 of HUD's part 8 interim rule published on May 6, 1983 (48 FR 20655) and
was retained in  8.27(b) of the part 8 final rule, published on June 2, 1988 (53 FR 20240). Because this provision
has been in HUD's section 504 regulations for approximately 10 years, the Department believes that HUD managers are
aware that they are legally empowered to_and will_require an applicant without disabilities to agree to move to a
non-accessible unit when one becomes available. 



Housing Adjustments ( 9.155) 



This section requires the Department to modify its housing policies and practices to ensure that they do not limit
the participation of tenants with disabilities. 



Comment:

 New Housing Policies Implemented In Response to Fair Housing Act Should be Included in  9.155. One commenter
stated that since the passage of both section 504 and the Fair Housing Act, HUD has changed some of its housing policies,
as for example, making FHA mortgages available to non-profit organizations for the purchase of single-family homes
that are to 
be used by groups of unrelated tenants with disabilities. The commenter recommended that these new policies be listed
in the regulation. 



Response.

 The Department does not believe that the part 9 rule is the proper place to enunciate any policy revisions resulting
from the Fair Housing Act. All new policies have been or will be announced in a more appropriate forum. 



Comment:

 Section 9.155(a) Should Include Reference to Reasonable Accommodation. Four commenters stated that the last sentence
of  9.155(a) discusses fundamental alterations and undue financial and administrative burdens but not reasonable
accommodation, which indicates that HUD has no duty to reasonably accommodate an individual's disability. 



Response.

 Again, the appropriate term, generally, for purposes of section 504 is ``reasonable modification.'' The reasonable
modification issue has been raised in connection with other sections of the part 9 rule. The Department refers the
commenters to its previous response on this issue as set forth in this preamble. 



Communications ( 9.160) 



Section 9.160 would require HUD to take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with personnel of other
Federal entities, applicants, participants and members of the public.

Comment: 

Section 9.160 Should Address the Communication Needs of Individuals with Impaired Cognitive Skills. One commenter
stated that this section focuses on individuals with hearing and sight disabilities, and excludes individuals with
impaired cognitive skills. 



Response. 

The provisions of this section are not intended to exclude individuals who have disabilities other than hearing and
vision impairments. Because hearing and vision impairments present easily identifiable communication difficulties,
a number of auxiliary aids and services have been designed to overcome these communication difficulties, and serve
as clear examples of how effective communication may be achieved under the requirements of section 504. However,
the provisions of  9.160 clearly provide that HUD shall, where necessary, furnish the auxiliary aid appropriate
to an individual's disability, and in determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, shall give primary consideration
to the request of the individual with disabilities. 



Compliance Procedures ( 9.170) 



Section 9.170 would establish the procedures for processing complaints arising under section 504. In the preamble
to the proposed rule, the Department specifically solicited comment on whether the compliance procedures for part
9 should include a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. (See 56 FR 24613.) 



Comment: 

Procedures Should Include Full Evidentiary Hearing Before an Administrative Law Judge. One commenter recommended
that HUD provide complainants with the opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing before an Administrative Law Judge
in appeals from the Assistant Secretary's determination. 



Response. 

The issue of whether the part 9 rule should provide for an administrative law judge was carefully considered by the
Department during development of the proposed part 9 rule, and again, after receiving this comment. The Department
has concluded that the complaint processing procedure set forth in  9.170 will provide for an adequate remedy,
and therefore, it is not necessary to provide for a hearing before an administrative law judge. Accordingly, the ``right
to request a hearing'' has been deleted from  9.170 of the final rule.



IV. Other Matters 





Coordination. 

This final rule has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is an adaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department
of Justice under Executive Order 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed to Executive agencies.
This final rule also has been reviewed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067
(43 FR 28967, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206). 



Environmental Impact. 

At the time of development of the proposed part 9 rule, a Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment
was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969. That Finding of No Significant Impact remains applicable to this final rule and is available for
public inspection during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. 



Impact on Small Entities. 

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication, and by approving it, certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on small entities.
The purpose of this rule is to provide for the enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as it applies
to programs or activities conducted by HUD. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that the policies contained in this rule would not, if implemented, have substantial direct effects
on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Specifically, the requirements
of this rule are directed to HUD programs and activities, and do not impinge upon the relationship between the Federal
government and State and local governments. Accordingly, the rule is not subject to review under the Order.



Executive Order 12606, the Family. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

the Family,

 has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and
general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule establishes requirements prohibiting
discrimination against individuals with disabilities in programs and activities conducted by HUD. 



Semiannual Agenda of Regulations.

 This rule was listed as sequence number 1528 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20434) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 9 


Blind, Buildings, Civil rights, Employment, Equal employment opportunity, Federal buildings and facilities,
Government employees, Persons with disabilities.




Accordingly, title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by adding a new part 9, consisting of   9.101
through 9.170, to read as follows:

 9.101

Purpose. 


The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental
Disabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to prohibit discrimination
on the basis of disability in programs or activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States Postal Service.




 9.102

Applicability. 


This part applies to all programs or activities conducted by the agency, except for programs or activities conducted
outside the United States that do not involve individuals with disabilities in the United States. 



 9.103

Definitions. 


For purposes of this part: 


Accessible: 

(1) When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of a facility or a portion of a facility other
than an individual dwelling unit, means that the facility or portion of the facility when designed, constructed or
altered, complies with applicable accessibility standards and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals
with physical disabilities. The phrase ``accessible to and usable by'' is synonymous with accessible. 

(2) When used with respect to the design, construction, or alteration of an individual dwelling unit, means that the
unit is located on an accessible route and, when designed, constructed, altered or adapted, complies with applicable
accessibility standards, and can be approached, entered, and used by individuals with physical disabilities. A
unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in  9.151
is ``accessible'' within the meaning of this definition. When a unit in an existing facility which is being made accessible
as a result of alterations is intended for use by a specific qualified individual with disabilities (e.g., a current
occupant of such unit or of another unit under the control of the same agency, or an applicant on a waiting list), the
unit will be deemed accessible if it meets the requirements of applicable standards that address the particular disability
or impairment of such person. 



Accessible route 

means a continuous unobstructed path connecting accessible elements and spaces of a building or facility. Interior
accessible routes may include corridors, floors, ramps, elevators, lifts, and clear floor space at fixtures. Exterior
accessible routes may include parking access aisles, curb ramps, crosswalks at vehicular ways, walks, ramps and
lifts. 



ADA 

means the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 through 12213) 



ADA Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) 

means the Accessibility Guidelines issued under the ADA, and which are codified in the Appendix to 39 CFR part 1191.




Adaptability 

means the ability of certain building, spaces and elements, such as kitchen counters, sinks, and grab bars, to be added
or altered, to accommodate the needs of persons with or without disabilities, or to accommodate the needs of persons
with different types or degrees of disability. For example, in a unit adaptable for a person with impaired hearing,
the wiring for visible emergency alarms may be installed but the alarms need not be installed until such time as the
unit is made ready for occupancy by a person with impaired hearing. 



Agency 

means the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 



Alteration 

means a change to a building or facility or its permanent 
fixtures or equipment that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or part thereof. Alterations
include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration,
changes or rearrangements of the structural parts and changes or rearrangements in the plan configuration of walls
and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, re-roofing, painting, or wallpapering or changes to mechanical
and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility. 



Assistant Attorney General 

means the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, United States Department of Justice. 



Assistant Secretary 

means the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. 



Auxiliary aids 

means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or communication skills to have an equal
opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, programs or activities conducted by the agency. For example,
auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired vision include readers, Brailled materials, audio recordings,
and other similar services and devices. Auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired hearing include telephone
handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's),
interpreters, note takers, written materials, and other similar services and devices. 



Complete complaint 

means a written statement that contains the complainant's name and address and describes the agency's alleged discriminatory
action in sufficient detail to inform the agency of the nature and date of the alleged violation of section 504. It shall
be signed by the complainant or by someone authorized to do so on his or her behalf. Complaints filed on behalf of classes
or third parties shall describe or identify (by name, if possible) the alleged victims of discrimination. 



Current illegal use of drugs 

means illegal use of drugs that occurred recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is
current or that continuing use is a real and ongoing problem. 



Drug 

means a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I through V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21
U.S.C. 812). 



Facility 

means all or any portion of buildings, structures, site improvements, complexes, equipment, roads, walks, passageways,
parking lots, rolling stock or other conveyances, or other real or personal property located on a site. 



Historic properties 

means those properties that are listed or are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or
such properties designated as historic under a statute of the appropriate State or local government body. 



Illegal use of drugs 

means the use of one or more drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. 812). The term ``illegal use of drugs'' does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a
licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions
of Federal law.

 9.130

General prohibitions against discrimination. 


(a) No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation
in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted
by the agency. 
(b) (1) The agency, in providing any housing, aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual,
licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability_
(i) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing,
aid, benefit, or service; 
(ii) Afford a qualified individual with disabilities an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the housing,
aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others; 
(iii) Provide a qualified individual with disabilities with any housing, aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective
in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement
as that provided to others; 
(iv) Provide different or separate housing, aid, benefits, or services to individuals with disabilities or to any
class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified
individuals with disabilities with housing, aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to
others; 
(v) Deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory
boards; 
(vi) Deny a dwelling to an otherwise qualified buyer or renter because of a disability of that buyer or renter or a person
residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is sold, rented or made available; or 
(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with disabilities in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage,
or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the housing, aid, benefit, or service. 
(2) For purposes of this part, housing, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to
produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with disabilities and for persons without disabilities,
but must afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit,
or to reach the same level of achievement. 
(3) The agency may not deny a qualified individual with disabilities the opportunity to participate in programs or
activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of programs or activities that are permissibly
separate or different for persons with disabilities. 
(4) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration
the purpose or effect of which would: 
(i) Subject qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; or 
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals
with disabilities. 
(5) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which
would: 
(i) Exclude individuals with disabilities from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination
under any program or activity conducted by the agency; or 
(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to
individuals with disabilities. 
(6) The agency, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals
with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability. 
(7) The agency may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals
with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the agency establish requirements for the
programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with disabilities
to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or
certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part. 
(c) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, persons without disabilities may be excluded from the benefits
of a program if the program is limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with disabilities. A specific
class of individuals with disabilities may be excluded from a program if the program is limited by Federal statute
or Executive order to a different class of individuals.

(2) Certain agency programs operate under statutory definitions of ``persons with disabilities'' that are more
restrictive than the definition of ``individual with disabilities'' contained in  9.103. Those definitions
are not superseded or otherwise affected by this regulation. 
(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of
qualified individuals with disabilities. 
(e) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement
that, based on disability, imposes inconsistent or contradictory prohibitions or limits upon the eligibility of
qualified individuals with disabilities to receive services or to practice any occupation or profession. 
(f) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section does
not limit the general prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section. 


 9.131

Direct threat. 


(a) This part does not require the agency to permit an individual to participate in, or benefit from the goods, services,
facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that agency when that individual poses a direct threat
to the health or safety of others. 
(b) ``Direct threat'' means a significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification
of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services. 
(c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others, the agency must make
an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best
available objective evidence to ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that
the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures
will mitigate the risk.

[Reserved] 


 9.140

Employment. 


No qualified individual with disabilities shall, on the basis of disability, be subjected to discrimination in employment
under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section
501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
in 29 CFR part 1613 (subpart G), shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities. 


  9.141_9.148

[Reserved] 


 9.149

Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited. 


Except as otherwise provided in  9.150, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's
facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded
from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the
agency. 


 9.150

Program accessibility: existing facilities. 


(a) 

General. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the agency shall operate each program or activity so
that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with
disabilities. This section does not_ 
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals
with disabilities; 
(2) In the case of historic properties, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment
of significant historic features of an historic property; or 
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature
of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel
believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial
and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with  9.150(a) would result
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made
by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and
operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching
that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action
that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities
receive the benefits and services of the program or activity. 
(b) 

Methods. 

The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment
of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at
alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible
rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable
by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where
other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, 
in making alterations to existing buildings, also shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled
by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157), and any regulations implementing
it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority
to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated
setting appropriate.

(c) 

Time period for compliance. 

The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section within sixty days of July 18, 1994 except
that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made within three years of July
18, 1994, but in any event as expeditiously as possible. 

(d) 

Transition plan. 

In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency
shall develop, within six months of July 18, 1994, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete
such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with disabilities
or organizations representing individuals with disabilities, to participate in the development of the transition
plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public
inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum_

(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities
to individuals with disabilities; 

(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible; 

(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period
of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition
period; and 

(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan. 

(e) The requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall apply to the Property Disposition Programs.
However, this section does not require HUD to make alterations to existing facilities that are part of the Property
Disposition Programs unless such alterations are necessary to meet the needs of a current or prospective tenant during
the time when HUD expects to retain legal possession of the facilities, and there is no 
alternative method to meet the needs of that current or prospective tenant. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to require alterations to make facilities accessible to persons with disabilities who are expected to occupy the
facilities only after HUD relinquishes legal possession. 



 9.151

Program accessibility: new construction and alterations. 



Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall
be designed, constructed, or altered and provide emergency egress so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals
with disabilities. The definitions, requirements, and accessibility standards that apply to buildings covered
by this section are those contained in the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility for the
type of construction or alteration being undertaken, and in this case, the definitions, requirements and standards
of the ADAAG shall apply. 



 9.152

Program accessibility: alterations of Property Disposition Program multifamily housing facilities. 



(a) 

Substantial alteration. 

If the agency undertakes alterations to a PDP multifamily housing project that has 15 or more units and the cost of the
alterations is 75 percent or more of the replacement cost of the completed facility, then the project shall be designed
and altered to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Subject to paragraph (c) of this
section, a minimum of five percent of the total dwelling units, or at least one unit, whichever is greater, shall be
made accessible for persons with mobility impairments. A unit that is on an accessible route and is adaptable and otherwise
in compliance with the standards set forth in paragraph (d) of this section is accessible for purposes of this section.
An additional two percent of the units (but not less that one unit) in such a project shall be accessible for persons
with hearing or vision impairments. If state or local requirements for alterations require greater action than this
paragraph, those requirements shall prevail. 

(b) 

Other alteration. 

(1) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, alterations to dwelling units in a PDP multifamily housing project shall,
to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. If
alterations of single elements or spaces of a dwelling unit, when considered together, amount to an alteration of
a dwelling unit, the entire dwelling unit shall be made accessible. Once five percent of the dwelling units in a project
are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with mobility impairments, then no additional elements of dwelling
units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph. Once two percent of the dwelling
units in a project are readily accessible to or usable by individuals with hearing or vision impairments, then no additional
elements of dwelling units, or entire dwelling units, are required to be accessible under this paragraph. 

(2) Alterations to common areas or parts of facilities that affect accessibility of existing housing facilities,
shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be made to be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. 

(c) The agency may establish a higher percentage or number of accessible units than that prescribed in paragraphs
(a) or (b) of this section if the agency determines that there is a need for a higher percentage or number, based on census
data or other available current data. In making such a determination, HUD shall take into account the expected needs
of eligible persons with and without disabilities. 

(d) The definitions, requirements, and accessibility standards that apply to PDP multifamily housing projects
covered by this section are those contained in the UFAS, except where the ADAAG provides for greater accessibility
for the type of alteration being undertaken, and, in this case, the definitions, requirements and standards of the
ADAAG shall apply.

(e) With respect to multifamily housing projects operated by HUD, but in which HUD does not have an ownership interest,
alterations under this section need not be made if doing so would impose undue financial and administrative burdens
on the operation of the multifamily housing project. 



 9.153

Distribution of accessible dwelling units. 



Accessible dwelling units required by  9.152 shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be distributed throughout
projects and sites and shall be available in a sufficient range of sizes and amenities so that a qualified individual
with disabilities' choice of living arrangements is, as a whole, comparable to that of other persons eligible for
housing assistance under the same agency conducted program. This provision shall not be construed to require (but
does allow) the provision of an elevator in any multifamily housing project solely for the purpose of permitting location
of accessible units above or below the accessible grade level. 



 9.154

Occupancy of accessible dwelling units. 



(a) The agency shall adopt suitable means to assure that information regarding the availability of accessible units
in PDP housing facilities reaches eligible individuals with disabilities, and shall take reasonable nondiscriminatory
steps to maximize the utilization of such units by eligible individuals whose disability requires the accessibility
features of the particular unit. To this end, when an accessible unit becomes vacant, the agency (or its management
agent) before offering such units to an applicant without disabilities shall offer such unit: 

(1) First, to a current occupant of another unit of the same project, or comparable projects under common control,
having disabilities requiring the accessibility features of the vacant unit and occupying a unit not having such
features, or, if no such occupant exists, then 

(2) Second, to an eligible qualified applicant on the waiting list having a disability requiring the accessibility
features of the vacant unit.

(b) When offering an accessible unit to an applicant not having disabilities requiring the accessibility features
of the unit, the agency may require the applicant to agree (and may incorporate this agreement in the lease) to move
to a non-accessible unit when available. 



 9.155

Housing adjustments. 



(a) The agency shall modify its housing policies and practices as they relate to PDP housing facilities to ensure that
these policies and practices do not discriminate, on the basis of disability, against a qualified individual with
disabilities. The agency may not impose upon individuals with disabilities other policies, such as the prohibition
of assistive devices, auxiliary aids, alarms, or guides in housing facilities, that have the effect of limiting the
participation of tenants with disabilities in any agency conducted housing program or activity in violation of this
part. Housing policies that the agency can demonstrate are essential to the housing program or activity will not be
regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section if modifications would result in a fundamental alteration
in the nature of the program or activity or undue financial and administrative burdens. 

(b) The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program
or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action
required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other
action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum
extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

 9.160 

Communications. 



(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel
of other Federal entities, and members of the public. 

(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with disabilities
an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency. 

(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests
of the individual with disabilities. 

(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices
of a personal nature. 

(2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries or members of the public by telephone, telecommunication
devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with
persons with impaired hearing. 

(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain
information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities. 

(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users
to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility
shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility. 

(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental
alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances
where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would
result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this
section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration
or burdens must be made by the Secretary or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for
use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement
of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with 
 9.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not
result in such an alteration or such 
burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive
the benefits and services of the program or activity. 



 9.170 

Compliance procedures. 



(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this section applies to all allegations of discrimination
on the basis of disability in programs or activities conducted by the agency. 

(b) The agency shall process complaints alleging violations 
of section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures established by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in 29 CFR part 1613 under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). 

(c) The Responsible Official shall coordinate implementation of this section. 

(d) Persons may submit complete complaints to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, 451
Seventh St., SW., Washington, DC 20410, or to any HUD Area Office. The agency shall accept and investigate all complete
complaints for which the agency has jurisdiction. All complete complaints shall be filed within 180 days of the alleged
act of discrimination. The agency may extend this time period for good cause. For purposes of determining when a complaint
is filed, a complaint mailed to the agency shall be deemed filed on the date it is postmarked. Any other complaint shall
be deemed filed on the date it is received by the agency. The agency shall acknowledge all complaints, in writing, within
ten (10) working days of receipt of the complaint. 

(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant
and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate Government entity. 

(f) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint
alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C.
4151 through 4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency shall delete
the identity of the complainant from the copy of the complaint. 

(g)(1) Within 180 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the Office of Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity shall complete the investigation of the complaint, attempt informal resolution, and if no
informal resolution is achieved, issue a letter of findings. If a complaint is filed against the Office of Fair Housing
and Equal Opportunity, the Secretary or a designee of the Secretary shall investigate and resolve the complaint through
informal agreement or letter of findings. 

(2) If a complaint is resolved informally, the terms of the agreement shall be reduced to writing and made part of the
complaint file, with a copy of the agreement provided to the complainant and the agency. The written agreement may
include a finding on the issue of discrimination and shall describe any corrective action to which the complainant
and the respondent have agreed. 

(3) If a complaint is not resolved informally, the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity or a person designated
under this paragraph shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in a letter containing_

(i) Findings of fact and conclusions of law; 

(ii) A description of a remedy for each violation found; 

(iii) A notice of the right to appeal to the Secretary; 

(h)(1) Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies must be filed by the complainant within 90
days of receipt from the agency of the letter required by  9.170(g). The Assistant Secretary or the person designated
by the Secretary to decide an appeal of a complaint filed against the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity may
extend this time for good cause. 

(2) Timely appeals shall be accepted and processed by the Assistant Secretary. Decisions on an appeal shall not be
issued by the person who made the initial determination. 

(i) The Assistant Secretary or the person designated by the Secretary to decide an appeal of a complaint filed against
the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within 60
days of the receipt of the request. If the agency determines that it needs additional information from the complainant,
it shall have 60 days from the date it receives the additional information to make its determination on the appeal.


(j) The time limits cited in paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section may be extended with the permission of the Assistant
Attorney General. 

(k) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies, except
that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.

Rehabilitation Training: Rehabilitation Long-Term Training 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing grants for long-term training to implement the Rehabilitation Act
Amendments of 1992 and the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments of 1994.
The Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program is authorized by section 302 of Title III of the Rehabilitation Act
of 1973, as amended (the Act). The purpose of this discretionary grant program is to fund projects to provide academic
training in areas of personnel shortages identified by the Secretary.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These final regulations implement changes made by the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 
(Pub. L. 102-569) and the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities Act Amendments
of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-218). These amendments direct the Secretary to issue regulations, as appropriate, to carry
out the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. 


This program supports the National Education Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American be literate and possess
the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship. The Department supports a variety of training activities for vocational rehabilitation personnel
so that they may assist individuals with disabilities in gaining the knowledge and skills to obtain employment and
compete in a global economy. 
On October 8, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the Rehabilitation Long-Term
Training program in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 52606). The major issues related to this program are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. Significant changes
resulting from public comment since publication of the NPRM include_(1) A waiver provision for part of the non-Federal
share of the cost of a project if an applicant demonstrates that it does not have sufficient resources for the entire
match; (2) An exemption for existing projects from the requirement to direct 75 percent of the total award to scholarships;
and (3) A broadening of the term ``deaf'' to include individuals who are ``hard of hearing'' and of the term ``blind''
to include individuals who have ``vision impairment.'' 
In addition, after the NPRM was published, the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities
Act Amendments of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-218) was enacted. Those amendments included a technical change to the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended, in the area of rehabilitation training. That statutory change has been incorporated into
these regulations by adding the use, applications, and benefits of assistive technology devices and assistive technology
services to the list of areas of personnel shortages identified in  386.1. 


Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 386 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. 
Major issues are grouped according to subject, with appropriate sections of the regulations referenced in parentheses.
Other substantive issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and
other minor changes are not addressed.

General Comments 






Intent of Change in Long-Term Training Regulations




Comment: 

A commenter expressed the opinion that since university programs have long been addressed in the long-term category,
the change in regulations appears to be intended to eliminate any training that results in less than an academic degree.



Discussion: 

Approximately 70 percent of grants under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program are currently for academic
training. The 30 percent that are non-academic are concentrated in several areas: Administration, prosthetics
and orthotics, community rehabilitation personnel, mental illness, independent living, client assistance program,
supported employment, and deafness. The intent is not to eliminate any training for less than an academic degree,
but to clarify and focus the specific mission of each training authority to improve program management. Regulations
that accurately reflect the program purpose of providing academic training in areas of personnel shortages identified
by the Secretary permit targeted allocations of funds to specific personnel needs, facilitate pertinent outcome
measures, and ensure that administrative requirements relating to proposal evaluations, scholarships, recordkeeping,
matching, and reporting are appropriate. 


Changes: 

None. 


Insufficient Public Input in the Regulations Development Process 




Comments: 

There were a number of comments stating that the proposed regulations were developed without participation of the
rehabilitation field. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that open and extensive public participation strengthens the regulations process. In fact,
extensive public input was obtained when the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) convened a public meeting
on rehabilitation training and published a notice requesting written public comments in May 1991. Comments received
provided useful information that was considered in crafting the regulations. Also, training meetings were held
throughout the United States in 1993 on the Rehabilitation Act Amendments. 


Changes: 

None. 


The Department Should Conduct a Needs Assessment Before Enacting New Regulations That Reduce or Eliminate Post-Employment
Training for Rehabilitation Personnel




Comments: 

Most of the comments calling for needs assessments were from direct service providers who were concerned that the
academic program emphasis in the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program would reduce or eliminate crucial training
for current service delivery personnel. 


Discussion: 

The Department has conducted needs assessments of the training needs of personnel providing vocational rehabilitation
services to individuals with disabilities since 1983 and will continue to do so in the future, as the authorizing statute
requires it. 


Changes: 

None. 


Funding Post-Employment Training if Long-Term Training Regulations Are Enacted




Comments: 

A number of commenters expressed concern that there appears to be no money to provide post-employment training under
training authorities other than long-term training. Commenters requested that, if the Rehabilitation Long-Term
Training program is to be substantially changed, new regional networks of community-based continuing education
units be established. These units would be similar to the Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs and would
be focused on individuals at the front lines of service delivery. Several commenters suggested that separate regulations
could be developed for university and non-university grant recipients. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that post-employment training needs of community rehabilitation training providers should
be addressed, in part, by a network of regional continuing education programs. The Secretary annually allocates
funds to address personnel shortages of qualified rehabilitation personnel. These funds are targeted to address
training needs by professional discipline and rehabilitation jobs. The Secretary submits an annual report to the
Congress containing and justifying rehabilitation training allocations in detail. The Secretary has authority
to allocate funds from the long-term training area to continuing education or other short-term or specialized training
for post-employment training of community rehabilitation personnel. 


Changes: 

None. 


Specific Comments by Section 


The Program Purpose of Rehabilitation Long-Term Training (  386.1 and 386.20(g)(2)




Comments: 

A number of commenters supported inclusion of academic training as the primary purpose of the Rehabilitation Long-Term
Training program. They stated that the emphasis on academic outcomes is consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1992 (1992 Amendments) to the Rehabilitation Act, which stress the use of ``qualified'' personnel.
However, a number of other commenters asked about the statutory authority for funding only academic programs and
excluding continuing education programs under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program. These commenters
argued that there is no justification in the Rehabilitation Act for stating that the purpose of RSA's Long-Term Training
program is to provide ``academic'' training. 


Discussion: 

Section 302 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, is the statutory basis for the rehabilitation training programs.
Except for the in-service training program, which now is included in the Act, the specific rehabilitation training
programs, including the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program, are established in regulations issued by the
Secretary based on the statutory authority in section 302. The Secretary establishes programs so that each has a specific
mission defined in regulations with appropriate outcome measures. The Secretary believes that the long-term training
program should be focused on academic training. 


Changes: 

None 


Client Assistance Program (CAP) ( 386.1)




Comments: 

Several commenters observed that preparation for employment in client assistance programs is not currently offered
in academic training settings and that CAP training should continue to be provided under long-term training. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that no current academic training exists for preparing individuals to work in client assistance
programs and that there is a demonstrated need for continued post-employment training of CAP personnel. Existing
CAP training projects will continue to be funded until their current grant periods end. The Secretary plans to invite
future applications for CAP training under the provisions in section 302 of the Act and in the general regulations
for Rehabilitation Training in 34 CFR part 385. Future CAP training notices will be targeted to specific needs for
training and technical assistance and published for public comment before applications are solicited. 


Changes: 

None.

Fields of Study Under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training Program ( 386.1) 




Comments: 

Several commenters suggested revisions in the listing of fields of study to conform with the listing of fields of study
in section 302(b)(1)(B) of the Rehabilitation Act and to include additional, specific fields, such as vision therapy
and rehabilitation computer systems. 


Discussion: 

The listing of fields in the Rehabilitation Act does not provide enough detail. For example, a specific category is
needed for the Secretary to target training resources for the preparation of specialized personnel for individuals
who are blind or have vision impairment. The list of 30 areas established in regulations builds upon the listing in
the Act by using areas that have been included in past long-term training competitions because they are areas where
needs assessments show continuing needs. The Secretary has the authority under  386.1(b)(30) of the regulations
to invite applications in other fields, such as vision therapy and rehabilitation computer systems, contributing
to the rehabilitation of individuals with disabilities. Also, the Experimental and Innovative Training program
(34 CFR part 387) offers opportunities for submittal of proposals to develop new types of training programs for rehabilitation
personnel. 


Changes: 

None. 


Use of the Term ``Blind'' and the Term ``Deaf'' ( 386.1) 




Comments: 

One commenter suggested that the term ``blind'' be eliminated because it connotes the absence of vision, and the vast
majority of individuals who are targeted for rehabilitation under this category have residual vision (i.e., are
partially sighted). Another commenter suggested substituting a broader category that would include blind individuals
as well as other individuals with visual impairment. One Commenter suggested elimination of the term ``deaf'' as
it connotes the absence of hearing, and many individuals served under the Rehabilitation Act have partial hearing
loss. The commenter suggested use of a more inclusive phrase, such as persons with hearing loss. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that a change is needed in the identification of these categories of training. In the past, the
Act included specialized personnel in providing services to individuals who are blind and to individuals who are
deaf among the targeted areas of personnel shortages to which training projects might be directed. The terms ``blind''
and ``deaf'' were not specifically defined, but were broadly interpreted to include individuals with partial or
total vision or hearing loss. The 1992 Amendments removed the terms ``blind'' and ``deaf'' from the listing of training
areas in section 302(b)(1) and substituted training of personnel to provide services to individuals with specific
disabilities. Since the regulations in 34 CFR part 386 provide the basis for specific allocations of training funds
to targeted areas of personnel shortages, it is particularly important that the listing of targeted areas be as specific
and inclusive as possible. 


Changes: 

The Secretary has included ``specialized personnel for rehabilitation of individuals who are blind or have vision
impairment'' and ``specialized personnel for rehabilitation of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing'' as
targeted areas within  386.1 for training allocations. 


Lack of Academic Training in Guam ( 386.1)




Comment: 

One commenter expressed concern that rehabilitation training in Guam, which in the past has been provided through
continuing education projects under the long-term training program, will no longer be available. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary recognizes the need for improved access to rehabilitation training for Guam and other remote and isolated
areas. The Secretary believes that these needs will be met, in part, by distance learning training, which was first
funded in fiscal year 1993 as a result of the 1992 Amendments (section 803(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended).



Changes: 

None. 


Eligibility of State Agencies and Other Public or Nonprofit Agencies and Organizations, Including Institutions
of Higher Education, Under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training Program ( 386.2) 




Comment: 

One commenter noted that, since State agencies and other public or nonprofit agencies do not offer degrees or certificates,
maintaining those organizations as eligible applicants implies the intent to continue non-academic long-term
training. 


Discussion: 

Section 302(a) of the Act establishes the broad eligibility criteria for applicants under the Rehabilitation Long-Term
Training program. The Secretary is aware of the rapidly changing auspices and circumstances under which specialized
academic and certificate training is offered in the field of rehabilitation. Consortia and partnerships of States,
public or nonprofit private agencies and organizations, and institutions of higher education may be formed to address
rehabilitation training needs. The Secretary encourages those efforts and desires regulations that will facilitate
new approaches through flexibility in eligibility requirements. 


Changes: 

None. 


Professional Corporation or Professional Practice ( 386.4) 




Comment: 

One commenter wrote in support of the provisions in the regulations that define professional corporation or professional
practice. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary appreciates the support for the definition of professional corporation or professional practice.



Changes: 

None. 


Related Agency ( 386.4) 




Comment: 

One commenter suggested substituting the legislative definition of ``community rehabilitation program'' in place
of the language proposed in  386.4(b) describing related agencies that are not American Indian rehabilitation
programs.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00107 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion:

 Section 7(25) of the Act includes an expanded definition of ``community rehabilitation program.'' The Secretary
reviewed the definition of community rehabilitation program in preparing regulations implementing the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1992. There is not an exact match between the expanded definition of community rehabilitation program
in Title I of the Act and the legislative definition of related agency in Title III. Therefore, ``community rehabilitation
program'' was not used in the definition of related agency. 


Changes:

 None. 



Including Specific References to Culturally Diverse Populations in Appropriate Sections of the Regulations (  386.1,
386.20, 386.33, and 386.40)





Comments:

 Several commenters felt that, although individuals who are unserved or underserved by programs under the Act are
specifically referenced in the description of the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program, policies and procedures
to include culturally diverse recruitment and retention efforts should be implemented for all 30 categories of rehabilitation
training. Selection criteria should be modified to give credit for program development related to culturally diverse
populations. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that it is essential that all requirements in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, are
implemented to ensure equal access and outreach for traditionally underserved populations, including minorities.
At present, the primary method for directing rehabilitation training program grantees to meet those requirements
is through the assurances mandated for each applicant. The Department is currently working to implement section
21 of the Act, including outreach services and other related activities, to enhance the capacity of minority institutions
to compete for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. In the future, the Department may propose specific
priorities or selection criteria that address needs of traditionally underserved populations across the range
of rehabilitation discretionary programs. 


Changes:

 None. 


Minimum 10 Percent Matching Requirement ( 386.30)




Comments:

 Many comments were received objecting to the requirement that the Federal share of an award may not be more than 90 percent
of the total cost of a project under this program. A number of commenters pointed out that the eight percent indirect
costs currently allowed by the Department on training awards do not cover current administrative costs. Concern
was expressed that many universities would not provide a 10 percent match. Some commenters observed that the present
negotiated system offers flexibility. Many commenters pointed out that post-employment training programs for
community rehabilitation personnel would have difficulty with the 10 percent required match. Some university commenters
indicated that their institutions face substantial resource problems. Other commenters asked if the match could
be in-kind. One commenter wrote that the limitation of 90 percent Federal support for proposed projects is fair and
reasonable. 


Discussion:

 The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, requires a matching component for rehabilitation training grants. The
Secretary believes that, if the Department states the minimum matching amount in advance of negotiations, the award
process is more understandable and efficient. Most current academic grantees under the Rehabilitation Long-Term
Training program have negotiated awards with a match in excess of 10 percent. The Secretary is aware that a number of
non-academic, post-employment training grantees under this program have experienced difficulty meeting even
a 10 percent matching requirement. This problem will be solved, in part, by funding some future awards with a post-employment
focus under the Rehabilitation Continuing Education program in which the current matching requirement as presented
in recent closing date announcements is four percent. In all instances, the applicant share may be in-kind. As a result
of a recent program audit that identified problems in the use of faculty time for in-kind matching, the Secretary prefers
that the applicant share in the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program by directly funding student scholarship
assistance as the designated match. 


Changes:

 The 10 percent matching requirement remains, but a new provision has been added indicating that the Secretary may
waive part of the non-Federal share of the cost of the project if the applicant demonstrates during the negotiations
process that it does not have sufficient resources to contribute the entire match. 


Requirements for Directing Grant Funds: Adverse Impact of the Requirement That a Grantee Must Use at Least 75 Percent
of Total Award for Scholarships as Defined in  386.4 ( 386.31)




Comments: 

Numerous commenters, primarily from community rehabilitation programs and related personnel training programs,
expressed concern that the proposed 75 percent scholarship requirement would limit access of community rehabilitation
program personnel to needed continuing education programs. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that personnel employed in community rehabilitation programs should continue to receive short-term,
continuing rehabilitation training. This will be accomplished by offering that training under other, more appropriate
Rehabilitation Training program categories, including 34 CFR part 389 (Rehabilitation Continuing Education Programs)
and 34 CFR part 390 (Rehabilitation Short-Term Training). The Secretary believes that the availability of needed
post-employment training for community rehabilitation personnel will be provided through regional continuing
education programs. However, the Secretary wants to ensure that all currently funded multi-year long-term training
projects continue for the remainder of their project period.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00108 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Changes:

 A new provision has been added ( 386.31(c)) stating that the requirement for a grantee to use at least 75 percent
of the total award for scholarships does not apply for the remainder of the project period for multi-year projects
in existence as of October 1, 1994. 


Comments:

 One commenter expressed concern that directing long-term training programs to use at least 75 percent of their total
award for scholarships will reduce cross-training of professionals who work with individuals with disabilities.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that rehabilitation short-term, continuing education, and in-service training programs
offer excellent opportunities for cross-training of rehabilitation professionals. In addition, the Secretary
believes that existing professional program accreditation processes and individual licensure and certification
procedures by national, State, and professional organizations are attentive to cross-training needs. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Several commenters observed that scholarships are not needed in a prosthetic or orthotic curriculum because programs
attract more than enough qualified students. Moreover, it was noted that prosthetic and orthotic programs are costly
to operate. Students attend labor intensive lab classes with a low student to instructor ratio. Although programs
are making changes that will reduce expenses, supply and equipment costs are high, and without additional Federal
support, it would be difficult to operate them. Many students now take loans to pay for their education, are supported
by employers, or are self-supporting. Supplementation of these resources with direct student support from RSA could
be useful, but the commenters do not feel this should be the primary method of support. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges that prosthetics and orthotics (P & O) rehabilitation training is highly individualized
and often requires intensive lab supervision and high equipment costs. The Secretary will take these unique circumstances,
to the extent that they are supported with evidence in the proposal, into consideration in reviewing the requirement
to direct at least 75 percent of the total award for scholarships. The Secretary is concerned by the argument that scholarships
are not needed in 
P & O because the field attracts more than enough students. The purpose of the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training
program is to provide academic training in areas of personnel shortages identified by the Secretary. P & O has
been identified as an area with personnel shortages, and providing students with scholarships ensures that the work-or-repay
provisions of the Rehabilitation Act will direct graduates to service in support of State rehabilitation agencies
in areas of personnel shortages. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments:

 A number of commenters requested that the current regulations be maintained to address specialized nonacademic
programs in deafness, blindness, mental illness, independent living, and in vocational evaluation because unique,
one-of-a-kind projects currently funded under long-term training would no longer be eligible for support under
the new regulations.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program cannot be expected to meet all specialized
training needs, particularly in nonacademic areas. The Secretary plans to make greater use of the extensive flexibility
provided by section 302 of the Act and the six specific rehabilitation training programs to ensure that specialized
training needs are addressed.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Several representatives of tribal-controlled colleges commented that, because of support that they receive from
the Bureau of Indian Affairs for each Native American student, there is less need for stipends and scholarships as
student incentives. Tribal-controlled colleges, however, need greater levels of financial support to maintain
national and regional networks through faculty travel, for supervision at internship sites, for course development,
and for materials development. Commenters were concerned that the 75 percent limit would hurt program growth and
quality and would be detrimental to undergraduate rehabilitation programs in rural regions where graduates work
with American Indian clients.



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that tribal-controlled colleges and other training programs for Native Americans often conduct
rehabilitation training under unique circumstances. Under  386.31(b), the Secretary may award grants that
use less than 75 percent of the total award for scholarships based on the unique nature of the project. It will be particularly
important for applicants to document the unique circumstances that apply in their proposals to assist the Secretary
in making this determination.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Two commenters observed that, if a quantitative requirement regarding the percentage of funds directed to scholarships
is necessary, there should be a reduction in the limit and a broadening of the unique circumstances under  386.31(b)
if less than 75 percent of the funds are devoted to scholarships. The Department should provide examples of circumstances
of projects funded with less than 75 percent in scholarships. In addition, projects should be approved that demonstrate
that the shortage they intend to meet is best met by funding training program resources such as faculty and equipment.
Many traditional degree or certificate granting disciplines, such as physical medicine and rehabilitation and
its residency programs, are limited because of the lack of adequate numbers of faculty and, therefore, programs.
Also, there should be an exception for training programs in newly emerging areas, such as independent living, that
do not have degrees or certificates. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that a quantitative limit is necessary to establish clear standards for all applicants. Current
long-term training grants average over $100,000 per year; therefore, a grant with 75 percent of the award targeted
for scholarships will still have more than $25,000 for other related costs. Broadening the circumstances under which
unique projects may be supported that use less than 75 percent of the total award for scholarships is not consistent
with the overall objective of the long-term training program.



Changes: 

None.



Comments: 

Many commenters from university rehabilitation training programs expressed concern that programs at their institutions
might be discontinued if Federal funds were required to be directed to student support rather than for paying for instructional
costs.



Discussion: 

Existing regulations require academic training projects with a multi-year project period to increase the grantee's
share of teaching costs progressively in each succeeding year so that total personnel costs are fully absorbed by
the grantee at the termination of the project period. The 75 percent requirement provides greater latitude than existing
regulations.



Changes: 

None. 



Requirements for Directing Grant Funds: The Department of Education Should Target Priorities To Require Grantees
To Award Specific Degrees or Certificates ( 386.31).





Comments: 

One commenter requested that the Secretary use program announcements to target programs on degrees and certificates
in appropriate areas. Two commenters requested that the Secretary be sensitive to individual student preferences
for attending degree or certificate programs.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that current professional accreditation by the designated accrediting agency in the professional
field in which grant support is being provided is adequate assurance that an academic program offers an appropriate
degree. From time to time, the Secretary may assign an absolute priority to proposals offering a specific degree or
certificate if the Secretary has determined that personnel shortages in the professional field require that preference.
Those priorities will be presented for public comment before applications are solicited. The Secretary agrees that,
to the extent possible in responding to personnel shortages, a wide range of degree and certificate programs offering
Federal rehabilitation scholarship assistance should be available to facilitate student choice. However, no change
in the regulations is required. 


Changes:

 None. 


Exclusion of Federal Employees From Receiving Training Scholarships ( 386.33(a)(2)) 




Comment:

 One commenter protested that this is not a fair regulation because it discriminates against a group of people_Federal
employees. The example was a full-time GS-7 Federal correctional officer enrolled in a rehabilitation counseling
program at a university with an RSA grant. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the limitation on Federal employees serves no useful purpose. 


Changes:

 The restrictive language has been dropped. 


Grantee Disbursement and Scholarship Assurance Provisions (  386.33 Through 386.43)




Comments:

 Several commenters called for a less adversarial phrasing of scholarship conditions to enhance recruitment of trainees.
Other suggestions included placing the burden on the scholar (at the time of the exit interview) to report to the grantee
using a packet containing several change-of-address forms, change-of-employment forms, and a completion of work
obligation form. Another commenter stated the belief that any tracking or reporting activities pursuant to payback
obligations are the exclusive responsibility of the granting agency. 


Discussion:

 The regulations describe conditions that must be met by a grantee after award in subpart D and conditions that must
be met by a scholar in subpart E. No adversarial system of grantee vs. scholar or Federal agency vs. grantee is implied
or intended. The intent is to clearly identify the responsibilities of all parties. Tracking and recordkeeping,
which can be facilitated by change-of-address and change-of-employment forms, are not excessively burdensome
for the numbers of students supported by the average grant under the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program.



Changes:

 None. 


Work-or-Repay Requirements for Certificate Programs (  386.4 and 386.34) 




Comment:

 One commenter asked for assurances that the work-or-repay provisions will be applied to all academic degree pre-
or post-employment programs as well as to non-degree awarding, certificate granting continuing education programs.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the work-or-repay provision applies to each individual who receives a scholarship, whether
for a degree or a certificate program. The term ``certificate'' is defined in  386.4 of the regulations. Examples
of certificate programs that offer scholarships and are subject to the work-or-repay provision include post-baccalaureate
training in allied health areas, such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, and prosthetics and orthotics.
The Secretary believes that the work-or-repay provision does not apply to certificate programs in non-academic
or emerging areas because no scholarship assistance is provided to individuals. Assistance in the form of per-diem
expenses for short-term training is not considered to be scholarship assistance subject to the work-or-repay provision.
It would be burdensome and inappropriate to enforce a work-or-repay provision for that assistance. The Secretary
believes that confusion about the different types of certificates and the applicability of repayment will be resolved
by focusing the Rehabilitation Long-Term Training program on academic scholarship training (degree and certificate)
subject to the work-or-repay provision and using other more appropriate training authorities for non-academic,
non-scholarship, post-employment training. 


Changes: 

None.

Stricter Standards for Work-or-Repay Provision ( 386.34)




Comment: 

One commenter suggested that grantees be required to arrange for all scholars to attend an extensive pre-enrollment
work-or-repay seminar series at which participating agencies in the city or State (along with the grantee) would
provide clearly detailed information regarding job opportunities for and subsequent responsibilities of scholars.





Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that a job seminar would be valuable for many scholarship recipients and potential rehabilitation
employers. Such an activity, however, should be at the discretion of the grantee and not a regulatory requirement.





Changes: 

None. 



Flexibility in Future Applications of Work-or-Repay Requirements ( 386.34) 





Comment: 

One commenter encouraged flexibility in the application of this requirement to emerging fields like independent
living. 




Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the work-or-repay provision should apply only to academic training and that fields such
as independent living (IL) do not currently provide academic training subject to the work-or-repay provision. The
Secretary plans to support future post-employment training grants in IL under training authorities that are not
subject to the work-or-repay provision. However, it appears likely that research and curriculum development advances
will soon make academic training, particularly in community colleges, possible. Therefore, in anticipation of
the need to provide academic or certificate training opportunities, the Secretary has also retained IL as a Rehabilitation
Long-Term Training program field. 


Changes: 

None. 



Work-or-Repay Tracking Systems ( 386.34(g)) 






Comments: 

Several commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations inappropriately place grantee institutions
in watch-dog roles. In particular, there was objection to the requirement for documentation that the grantee has
checked for addresses of missing scholars with alumni organizations. 




Discussion: 

The Secretary does not believe that the requirement that the grantee check with university-sponsored alumni organizations
if it is experiencing difficulty in locating a scholar is inappropriate. The regulations do not constitute a basis
for forcing disclosure of records from any private organization. If a grantee cannot document, because of the inability
to locate a scholar who has graduated, that requirements of the work-or-repay provision have been met by an individual,
the grantee will be responsible for reporting to the Secretary that the individual has not completed the requirement.
The Secretary will then initiate enforcement actions as outlined in  386.43. The intent of the regulations
is to have the grantee exhaust all possibilities to locate and contact the individual before the matter is referred
to the Secretary. 





Changes: 

None.

Work-or-Repay Records ( 386.34(h))
 




Comments: 

Two commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations inappropriately obligate grantee institutions
to perform time-consuming and expensive database creation, maintenance, updating, and reporting functions for
as many as six years for which the grantee receives no compensation from the Federal Government. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that the work-or-repay provision is a partnership between grantees and the Federal Government.
Grantees are closest to the individuals and are in the best position to advise, assist, and admonish scholars on matters
related to their work-or-repay requirements. The Secretary believes that administrative costs for these activities
are minimal and are not feasible for line itemization. Instead, the Secretary sees these costs as subsumed under grantee
indirect costs. The regulations have been written to state clearly that the responsibility for recordkeeping extends
until the repayment period has ended for all students provided scholarships. 



Changes:

 None. 



June 1, 1992, Effective Date for New Work-or-Repay Provisions ( 386.34) 





Comment:

 A commenter expressed concern that this requirement is being imposed a full five months before the 1992 Amendments
to the Rehabilitation Act were even approved. The commenter asked how, if these proposed regulations are in response
to the 1992 Amendments, can this date be required since it predates the amendments? 



Discussion: 

The June 1992 effective date was set retroactively in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. 



Changes:

 None. 



Payback Requirements for Scholars Who Become University Educators ( 386.34)





Comments: 

Two commenters observed that the proposed regulations do not permit graduate and doctoral level scholarship recipients
to meet the work-or-repay provision by teaching at a university unless the university has a formal agreement with
the State agency identifying the university as a ``related agency.'' 



Discussion: 

The identification of a ``related agency'' derives from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. Educators whose
college or university employer meets the definition of a related agency ( 386.4) by providing services to individuals
with disabilities under an agreement with a designated State agency and who are employed in the area of specialty for
which Federal support for their training was provided will have no problem meeting the requirement. Examples of acceptable
arrangements include educators who have agreements to supervise field placements of students in training at State
agencies and related agencies, who serve as advisors or consultants to State agencies and related agencies, and who
provide direct services through their universities, including the instruction of individuals with disabilities.
The key to meeting the work-or-repay requirement through employment in an educational institution is that the institution
have an appropriate agreement with the designated State agency and that the scholar work in his or her specialty area.




Changes: 

None. 



Proposed Six-Year Repayment Period ( 386.34) 





Comment:

 One commenter expressed concern that, after completing a two-year graduate program, a scholar will have only six
years for repayment instead of the current ten-year repayment period. 



Discussion:

 The time limits are set in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. 



Changes:

 None. 



Work-or-Repay Provisions for Scholars Receiving Federal Benefits ( 386.43)





Comment: 

One commenter suggested that the deferral of repayment due to disability be modified to exclude circumstances under
which the individual achieves Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) earned income status. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not believe that there is a need to distinguish the repayment status of scholars by the type of disability
benefits a scholar may be receiving. 



Changes: 

None. 



Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity
to comment on proposed regulations. However, the language added in  386.1(b)(30) merely incorporates into
the regulations a statutory change made by the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals With Disabilities
Act Amendments of 1994 to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and does not implement substantive policy. Therefore,
the Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on the change in the regulations
is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 



Intergovernmental Review 



This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and strengthened federalism by relying on processes
developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.


In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed regulations and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

the accumulated academic years of training for which the scholarship is received. 



(3) Until the scholar has satisfied the employment obligation described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the
scholar will inform the grantee of any change of name, address, or employment status and will document employment
satisfying the terms of the agreement. 



(4) Subject to the provisions in  386.41 regarding a deferral or exception, when the scholar enters repayment
status under  386.43(e), the amount of the scholarship that has not been retired through eligible employment

(e) 

Standards for satisfactory progress. 

The grantee will establish, publish, and apply reasonable standards for measuring

an institution's standards to be reasonable if the standards_


(1) Conform with the standards of satisfactory progress of the nationally recognized accrediting agency that accredits
the institution's program of study, if the institution's program of study is accredited by such an agency, and if the
agency has those standards; 



(2) For a scholar enrolled in an eligible program who is to receive assistance under the Rehabilitation Act, are the
same as or stricter than the institution's standards for a student enrolled in the same academic program who is not
receiving assistance under the Rehabilitation Act; and 



(3) Include the following elements: 



(i) Grades, work projects completed, or comparable factors that are measurable against a norm. 



(ii) A maximum timeframe in which the scholar shall complete the scholar's educational objective, degree, or certificate.

system must include for each employment position maintained by the scholar_


(1) Documentation of the employer's name, address, dates of the scholar's employment, and the position the scholar
maintained; 



(2) Documentation of how the employment meets the requirements in  386.34(c)(1)(i); and 



(3) Documentation that the grantee, if experiencing difficulty in locating a scholar, has checked with existing
tracking systems operated by alumni organizations. 



(h) 

Reports. 

The grantee shall make reports to the Secretary that are necessary to carry out the Secretary's functions under this
part. 



(i) 

Records. 

The grantee shall maintain the information obtained in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section for a period of time equal

ACTION:

 Final regulations.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program
consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the Federal Consolidation
Loan programs. These amendments are needed to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended
(HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325). Public Law 102-325 added new section
428J to the HEA which authorizes the Secretary to establish a demonstration program for loan forgiveness for certain
types of professional or public service. Under section 428J of the HEA, the Secretary is authorized to forgive portions
of Federal Stafford Loans incurred by a student borrower who performs volunteer service or works in certain teaching
or nursing areas. Minor changes to section 428J were made by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 (Pub.
L. 103-82). Section 428J was also recently amended by the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (Pub.
L. 103-208). Those additional statutory changes are also reflected in these regulations. This program is not
currently funded.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 New section 428J of the HEA authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to establish a loan forgiveness demonstration
program in the Federal Stafford Loan Program. The purpose of the demonstration program is to encourage individuals
to enter the teaching and nursing professions and to perform national and community service by offering partial Federal
Stafford loan forgiveness. If funding is provided, the loan forgiveness program is available only to 

new borrowers who, as of October 1, 1989, had no outstanding debt on a FFEL Program loan. 



On February 25, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for part 682 in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9376). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues surrounding the proposed changes which will not be
repeated here. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which
a discussion of those issues may be found: 

 Eligibility requirements for a borrower who wishes to qualify for loan forgiveness (page 9378); 

 Application procedures for loan forgiveness (page 9378); 

 Limitations of the loan forgiveness program (page 9378); 

 Requirements for borrowers desiring loan forgiveness under the teaching, volunteer service or nursing categories
(pages 9378-9379); 

 Percentages of loan amounts eligible for forgiveness based on year of service completed (page 9379). 



Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



Section 682.215(c) Application 



 The Secretary has defined September 1 as the earliest date in which a borrower can apply for loan forgiveness
in addition to the October 1 deadline for submitting applications. 

 The Secretary has clarified that borrowers who submit incomplete and inaccurate loan forgiveness applications
will not 

be considered for loan forgiveness unless and until a completed application is submitted. 



Section 682.215(i) Definitions 



 The Secretary has expanded the definition of both ``elementary school'' and ``secondary school'' to include
nonprofit private day or residential schools to be consistent with the definition for these terms in the Perkins Loan
Program definitions. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 14 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and of the changes made to the regulations as a result of those comments follows. 

Major issues are grouped according to subject. Technical and other minor changes, and suggested changes the Secretary
is 
not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority, are not addressed. 



Section 682.215(a) General 





Comment:

 Some commenters noted that there is no formal method specified in the regulations to inform borrowers about the loan
forgiveness program. The commenters recommended that details be provided to borrowers in the application/promissory
note or the disclosure statement. The commenters did not believe that lenders should be required to do a special mailing.




Discussion:

 The Secretary will ensure that guaranty agencies take steps to inform borrowers about the loan forgiveness program
should the program be funded. These methods may include mention in the application/promissory note or disclosure
statement or in public documents such as the Student Guide. Lenders will not be expected to publicize the program through
a special mailing. 



Change:

 None. 



Comment:

 A commenter recommended that the definition of eligible borrower be clarified to convey that a borrower who had paid
off an outstanding debt under the FFEL programs prior to October 1, 1989 would be eligible for the forgiveness program
if the borrower became a ``new'' borrower with their first disbursement of a new FFEL program loan on or after October
1, 1989. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the regulations convey that a borrower who has no outstanding debt under the FFEL 
programs as of October 1, 1989 would qualify as an eligible borrower. 



Change:

 None. 



Comment:

 A commenter asked if lenders would be required to produce a new repayment schedule for a borrower each year loan forgiveness
is granted. The commenter also suggested that the percentages of loan forgiveness should have no effect on the borrower's
current payments. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not believe that it is necessary for a lender to provide new repayment schedules to 
borrowers who receive loan forgiveness. The Secretary expects that the reduction of the loan amount owed by a borrower
as a result of the loan forgiveness will most likely result in a reduction of the number of payments to be made by the borrower.




Change:

 None. 



Comment:

 A commenter asked if all Federal Stafford loans were eligible for forgiveness under this demonstration program.




Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the regulations should be clarified to explain that subsidized, unsubsidized, and 
nonsubsidized Federal Stafford loans will be eligible for forgiveness under  682.215. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 



Comment:

 One commenter urged the Secretary to include loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program to be eligible
for the forgiveness program. The commenter believed that since the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 stated
that all terms and conditions under the Federal Stafford Loan Program, which include cancellation, deferment and
other provisions, also apply to the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, Congress intended for the loan forgiveness
program to be included as well. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that loans made under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program are eligible
for the forgiveness program. Direct Loan regulations will specify Direct Loan borrowers' eligibility for loan forgiveness
under this program.

<PARENT> FR940616-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Change: 

None. 


Comment:

 Some commenters believed that the Secretary should provide timeframes and procedures by which to notify borrowers
of their approval or denial of loan forgiveness eligibility. The commenters were also interested in knowing the timeframes
and procedures that the Secretary will adopt to notify the holder regarding which borrowers will receive forgiveness
and when the holder will be given the appropriate funds. 


Discussion:

 The borrower will be informed of his or her eligibility for loan forgiveness by the Secretary in a timely manner. The
Secretary will take appropriate steps to inform holders of proper procedures. However, the Secretary notes that
without knowing the amount of appropriations, if any, that might be available for the forgiveness program and the
potential number 
of recipients, it is impossible to define those methods in these regulations. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 Some commenters expressed concern about borrower confusion regarding the borrower's repayment obligation if the
borrower is eligible for loan forgiveness. The commenters were worried about the period of time between when a borrower
applies for loan forgiveness and the holder's receipt of the loan forgiveness payment from the Secretary. The commenters
wanted to know how the servicer would be notified that the borrower's loan or loans are eligible for loan forgiveness
and whether the 

borrower would be required to continue to make regular monthly payments in the time period between the loan forgiveness
application submission and payment from the Secretary. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the potential problems created by this structure. Because this program is not an entitlement,
the Secretary cannot promise an otherwise eligible borrower that funding will be available to award a percentage
of loan forgiveness. Therefore, the Secretary reminds the commenters that the borrower is still in repayment on his
or her loan, regardless of eligibility for the loan forgiveness unless he or she is in an authorized deferment or forbearance
period. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 One commenter wanted to know if a borrower could participate in both a state forgiveness program as well as this demonstration
program. 


Discussion: 

Although the National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12571 

et seq.

) precludes a borrower from receiving a loan cancellation benefit under both that program and this loan forgiveness
program, the Secretary believes that a borrower participating in the loan forgiveness program under  682.215
is eligible to participate in state forgiveness programs, where allowable by the state. 


Change:

 None. 

 


Section 682.215(b) 




Comment:

 Some commenters believed that in the instances where a defaulted borrower made satisfactory repayment arrangements
on the loans in default, a borrower should be allowed to have those defaulted loans forgiven as well. The commenters
believed that if the motivation behind the demonstration program was to encourage borrowers to enter into public
service, then defaulted borrowers could be further enticed into public service by being allowed to ``work off'' their
defaulted loans as well as those not in default. 


Discussion:

 This issue was thoroughly discussed at the negotiated rulemaking sessions that preceded publication of the NPRM.
Given that there may be limited or no funding for this program, the Secretary felt that it would be inappropriate to
provide this benefit on loans that are still in default. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment: 

A commenter recommended that the Secretary and the guaranty agencies establish a way to easily verify that satisfactory
repayment arrangements had been made on a loan that is to be considered eligible for loan forgiveness. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary encourages guaranty agencies to provide appropriate information to lenders regarding a borrower's
loan status. Additionally, the Secretary anticipates that the National Student Loan Data System will assist in providing
this type of information.

Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 Two commenters recommended that the Secretary should encourage guaranty agencies to consider those borrowers who
have defaulted on their loans but are likely to be eligible for loan forgiveness to be good candidates for a rehabilitated
loan. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that it is illogical to conclude that eligibility for one program assures eligibility for
another. The loan rehabilitation program has specific requirements separate from the forgiveness program. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 One commenter requested that the Secretary clarify that defaulted loans that have been rehabilitated should be eligible
for forgiveness. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter. Once a loan has been rehabilitated it is no longer in default and is therefore
considered to be eligible for forgiveness under this program. 


Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 


Section 682.215(c) 




Comment:

 Three commenters urged the Secretary to develop a standardized loan forgiveness application form that includes
such data items as borrower dates of service, loan balance information, eligibility, and interest amounts in order
to simplify the process. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees and is committed to consulting with FFEL participants to develop a standardized application
form pursuant to the requirements of section 432(1) of the HEA. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 One commenter questioned to whom the term ``designee'' in  682.215(c) refers. The commenter also recommended
that the Secretary provide the designee with a means by which to identify and verify that a certain type of facility,
tax-exempt organization or teacher shortage area meets the criteria of  682.215. The commenter suggested
that a more suitable alternative would be to require the certifying official to certify that the organization meets
the requirements of  682.215. 


Discussion:

 The term ``designee'' refers to the departmental official assigned with implementing this program. The Secretary
will provide the designee with all necessary information at the appropriate time if necessary. The Secretary notes
that the NPRM provided that the certifying official in each category of forgiveness certify that the borrower's service
meets the requirements of  682.215. 


Change:

 None. 


Comment:

 In considering the October 1 deadline for submitting forgiveness applications, some commenters recommended that
the regulations define a specific timeframe as to the earliest date an application for forgiveness may be received.
They reasoned that since funding for this program may be limited and will be awarded on a first-come, first-served
basis, applicants should be informed of the first date upon which they can apply. The commenters also wished to know
whether a borrower need complete the service prior to applying for forgiveness or merely have completed service before
the October 1 deadline. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a borrower should be informed of the first date on which a forgiveness
application can be received. A borrower's application for forgiveness should be postmarked no earlier than September
1 of each year that forgiveness is requested. The Secretary has chosen the September start date in order to be fair to
all categories of borrowers, since certain professions have more definitive begin and end dates or terms that may
end in June or July that would give them an advantage over other borrowers if the earliest date to apply was July or August.
The Secretary also believes that it is appropriate to require that the service be completed prior to the borrower's
submission of an application for forgiveness. This would result in fair treatment to the greatest number of borrowers
and would eliminate the need to confirm that the borrower completed the service. 


Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to include September 1 as the earliest date for forgiveness applications
to be received. 


Comment:

 A commenter asked if applications for forgiveness should be routed through the lender or guaranty agency or directly
to the Secretary.

Discussion

: Applications for loan forgiveness should be directed to the Secretary. 


Change

: None. 


Comment

: Some commenters felt that there should be a provision whereby a borrower who qualified for forgiveness one year but
did not receive it due to limited funding should be first to be considered for forgiveness the following year. The commenters
also wanted to know if a borrower who qualified and received the forgiveness one year would be automatically eligible
for the following year's forgiveness. 


Discussion

: This approach was discussed at the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The Secretary believes that given the limited
amount of funding, there is no statutory basis to allow eligible applicants from one year to automatically qualify
for the next year. Similarly, borrowers who were denied forgiveness due to lack of funding one year will not be given
priority over the next year's applicants. Borrowers are required to reapply 
for each year for which they wish to receive the forgiveness benefit. 


Change

: None. 


Comment

: Some commenters wanted to know how to treat a borrower's incomplete forgiveness application. The commenters asked
whether a borrower should be disqualified, or if allowed to provide the missing information, how much time should
a borrower have to submit the information. They also wanted to know if the borrower's first-come, first-served status
would be affected by submitting an incomplete application. 


Discussion

: An incomplete or inaccurate application will not qualify a borrower for receiving loan forgiveness. However, the
Secretary will attempt to notify the borrowers who submit inaccurate or incomplete applications so that they will
have an opportunity to complete and submit a complete application by the October 1 deadline. 


Change

: None. 


Comment

: A number of commenters expressed confusion over the treatment of borrowers with regard to forbearance. Some commenters
questioned whether forbearance for eligible borrowers under the forgiveness program was necessary or administratively
feasible. 


Discussion

: The Secretary reminds the commenters that all borrowers who request forbearance while they are serving in areas
that would qualify for forgiveness are entitled to forbearance as stated in section 428J. The ability to obtain forbearance
is based on the borrower's being engaged in qualifying service and is not dependent on whether the borrower actually
receives the loan forgiveness. 


Change

: None. 


Comment

: Some commenters asked when a borrower could request forbearance since the borrower does not apply for forgiveness
until after the year of service has been completed. The commenters questioned whether forbearance would be granted
retroactively at the time the borrower applied for forgiveness or if the lender or servicer would be expected to grant
forbearance to a borrower the year prior to application while the borrower was serving in an eligible position. The
commenters felt that the wording of the NPRM regarding forbearance may be confusing for a borrower who may think that
payments do not have to be made during the period of service. The commenters also wished to know if the forbearance applied
only to the loans eligible for forgiveness or on all loans. 


Discussion

: The Secretary wishes to emphasize that the holder or servicer is to grant forbearance to a borrower upon the borrower's
request while the borrower is serving in one of the categories of service eligible for forgiveness under  682.215.
A borrower shall receive forbearance while serving regardless of whether sufficient funding is available for forgiveness
at the end of that year of service. The forbearance will apply to all loans held by the borrower that would normally be
entitled to forbearance. A borrower who is not in an authorized deferment or forbearance status while serving is expected
to follow the terms of the promissory note regarding repayment. 


Change

: None. 


Comment

: Some commenters recommended that all borrowers in qualifying service that wish to apply for forbearance be given
explicit instruction as to the terms of the forbearance and the fact that receiving forbearance for service under
 682.215 was not related to receiving loan forgiveness for performing qualifying service. The commenters
were concerned that a borrower would be incurring additional costs with a forbearance with the potential of not receiving
the loan forgiveness benefit for performing qualifying service. 


Discussion

: The Secretary shares the concerns of the commenters and expects holders to provide information on the option of forbearance
under this program as is required under the FFEL programs. The holders will inform borrowers that funding, if available
for this program, is limited and that receiving a forbearance during qualifying service does not guarantee loan 
forgiveness under this program and as such may result in additional costs to the borrower. 


Change

: None. 


Section 682.215 (e), (f), and (g) 




Comment

: Some commenters asked that the Secretary clarify that a borrower must apply for forgiveness each year following

the year of qualifying service in the teaching, volunteer and nursing categories.

<DOCNO> FR940616-0-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-0-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion

: The Secretary anticipates that some eligible borrowers may have completed qualifying service in previous years
that would not be immediately preceding the time in which they apply for this program. In this situation, the Secretary
envisions that a borrower would need to indicate the begin and end date of the year of service, as all other eligible
borrowers are required to do. Loan forgiveness, if funding is available, would be at the level based on which year the
borrower last received forgiveness. For example, a borrower who qualified and received the benefit for the first
year of service, but not the second year, who now qualifies for forgiveness for the third year of service would receive
the benefit as a second year participant in the forgiveness program. 


Change

: The final regulations have been revised to clarify that a borrower must apply each year to obtain loan forgiveness
under this demonstration program. 


Section 682.215(h) 




Comment

: Some commenters asked whether all Federal Stafford loans are eligible for loan forgiveness. They recommended that
if all Federal Stafford loans are eligible the Secretary should specify how the holder should apply the forgiveness
amounts. 


Discussion

: The Secretary clarifies that unsubsidized, subsidized and nonsubsidized Federal Stafford loans are eligible
for this forgiveness program and that the holder should apply the forgiveness amounts first to the unsubsidized portion,
followed by the subsidized and then the nonsubsidized portion of the loans. 


Change

: The final regulations have been revised in both  682.215(a) and  682.215(h) to incorporate this clarification.



Comment

: Some commenters are worried that holders and servicers do not link individual loans to the specific academic years
when the borrower was in school and will therefore be unable to identify which years constitute the borrower's last
two years of undergraduate education or two-year period when the borrower was obtaining a post graduate teaching
or additional teaching certificate. 


Discussion

: The Secretary believes that holders and servicers are able to track loan amounts for this purpose because numerous
existing program requirements already require such tracking. Loans are made based on statutory annual loan limits
for applicable undergraduate and post baccalaureate academic levels. This data is available on a loan-by-loan basis
for each borrower in lender and guaranty agency systems and should be sufficient for purposes of implementing these
provisions. 


Change

: None. 


Section 682.215(h)(5) 




Comment

: A commenter objected to the provision in the NPRM that states that payments eligible for forgiveness under this program
that were already repaid by the borrower will not be refunded. The commenter noted that a prudent borrower may choose
not to risk the additional costs of forbearance given the questionable funding for this program and continue to repay
the loan, perhaps resulting in paying a loan amount that could have been forgiven but is now not eligible. 


Discussion

: The statute does not authorize the refunding of any repayment of a Federal Stafford loan. 


Change

: None.

Section 682.215(i) 





Comment:

 A commenter recommended that the term ``secondary school'' should not include education beyond the twelfth grade.
The commenter stated that this definition conflicts with the commonly recognized definition of postsecondary education
in many states and thus may confuse those involved in postsecondary education. 



Discussion:

 This definition was taken from already existing FFEL program regulations. 



Change:

 None. 



Comment:

 One commenter objected to the Secretary limiting the teaching forgiveness provision to borrowers who teach in public
elementary and secondary schools. The commenter pointed out that section 428J provides forgiveness for those borrowers
who teach full time in a school that qualifies under section 462(a)(2)(A) of the HEA for loan cancellation for Perkins
loan recipients. The commenter noted that under the Perkins Loan Program, cancellation is provided for full-time
teachers in nonprofit private elementary schools as well. The commenter requested that the Secretary make the definitions
of elementary school and secondary school consistent with the Perkins definitions. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter. 



Change:

 The final regulations have been revised to include nonprofit private schools in the elementary school and secondary
school definitions. This change allows those serving in these types of schools to be eligible under the teaching forgiveness
category of  682.215(e). 



Comment:

 A commenter suggested that the Secretary expand the definitions that pertain to the nursing category of loan forgiveness.
The commenter asked that the Secretary broaden the eligibility of sites to encourage more nursing graduates to participate
in the forgiveness program. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary consulted with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in determining the definitions that
would apply to the facilities described in section 428J in which a borrower would be employed full-time as a nurse.
These definitions were taken from HHS and other existing regulations. The statute indicates that the Secretary is
to rely on the expertise of HHS in these areas. Accordingly, there will be no change. 



Change:

 None. 



Executive Order 12866 



These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering the program effectively and efficiently. In assessing
the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary has determined
that the benefits of the regulations justify the costs. 

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 



Assessment of Educational Impact 



In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations would
require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of
the United States. 

Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own 
review, the Department has determined that the regulations in this document do not require transmission of information
that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.

Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration program. 



(a) 

General.

 The Federal Stafford Loan forgiveness demonstration program is intended to encourage individuals to enter the teaching
and nursing professions and to perform national and community service. Under this demonstration program, the Secretary
repays portions of unsubsidized, subsidized and nonsubsidized Federal Stafford obligations that were incurred
by a borrower during the borrower's last two years of undergraduate education if that borrower worked in those professions
or performed that service. For purposes of this section, an eligible borrower is a borrower who, as of October 1, 1989,
had no outstanding debt under the FFEL programs. 

(b) 

Borrower eligibility; requirements for qualification.

 A borrower may obtain loan forgiveness under this program if he or she was employed as a full-time teacher in certain
elementary and secondary schools teaching certain subjects or as a full-time nurse in certain types of hospitals
or health care centers, or was serving as a volunteer under the Peace Corps Act or under the Domestic Volunteer Service
Act of 1973, or was performing comparable service as a full-time employee of a tax exempt organization under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. For purposes of this section, 

full-time

 means the standard used by a State or profession in defining full-time employment. For a borrower serving in more than
one organization, the determination of ``full-time'' is based on the combination of all qualifying employment.
A borrower who is in default on a FFEL loan and has not made satisfactory repayment arrangements is not eligible for
forgiveness. However, if a borrower has made satisfactory repayment arrangements on the loan or loans in default,
the forgiveness applies only to the loan or loans held by the holder that are not in default. Federal Stafford loans
that have been rehabilitated are eligible for forgiveness. 

(c) 

Application.

 To qualify for the forgiveness program, an eligible borrower shall apply to the Secretary each year following a completed
year of service, but no earlier than September 1 and no later than October 1 of a given year. The application must be in
writing, on a form provided by the Secretary and according to procedures established by the Secretary. An eligible
borrower must complete a year of service prior to filing a loan forgiveness application with the Secretary. Eligible
borrowers are chosen on a first-come, first-served basis to participate and must receive forbearance upon request
for each year of service for which forgiveness is requested. An eligible borrower must reapply each year to receive
the forgiveness benefit. Incomplete or inaccurate applications are not considered in the first-come, first-served
process. If a borrower initially submits an incomplete or inaccurate application, the borrower must provide a completed
application to the Secretary or his designee prior to consideration in the selection process. 

(d) 

Limitation; Stafford forgiveness recipients.

 The total amount of loans forgiven is limited to the amount of funds appropriated for the fiscal year for the demonstration
program.
