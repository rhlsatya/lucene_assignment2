<USDEPT>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION</USDEPT>





Governing Bodies 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Legal Services Corporation. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed regulation would amend the Legal Services Corporation's (``LSC'' or ``Corporation'') regulations,
relating to governing bodies of recipients of LSC funds. Many of the revisions are simply intended to clarify current
Corporation policy or to interrelate this part to other LSC regulations. However, a number of the proposed revisions
represent changes in Corporation policy or interpretations with respect to issues that arise under the regulation.
The proposal also includes a number of technical revisions to make the rule easier to apply and use. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Operations and Regulations Committee of the LSC Board of Directors (``Committee'') held public hearings on April
15, 1994, in Washington, DC and on May 13, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia, to consider drafts of proposed revisions to 45
CFR part 1607, LSC's regulation on recipient governing bodies. At the meeting in Atlanta, the Committee approved
a draft to be published in the 

Federal Register

 as a proposed rule for public comment. 


The Corporation is extending the customary 30-day comment period to 60 days in order to allow bar associations and
other organizations with a specific interest in this rule sufficient time to comment. Bar associations play a substantial
role in the appointment of recipient board members, and the Committee encourages their involvement in this rulemaking
process. 
The Committee recognizes that reauthorization of the Corporation is presently under consideration by Congress.
Whenever Congress does reauthorize the Corporation, the Corporation's regulations will be revisited and revised
accordingly. 
This proposed rule is intended to amend 45 CFR part 1607 and to supersede part 1607's interpretive guideline published
at 48 FR 36820 (August 15, 1983). 


Section 1607.1 Purpose 


No change is proposed for this section. 


Section 1607.2 Definitions 


Most of the changes proposed for this section are technical and clarifying in nature. The section was reordered to
put the definitions in alphabetical order. Also, definitions found in other parts of the regulations, but applicable
to this part are included here for easier reference. In addition, language found in other sections of this part that,
in fact, constitute definitions of terms are included here both for easier reference and to treat similar terms similarly.
Some of the language has been clarified to make it consistent with past and current LSC interpretations. 
Section 1607.2(a). The definition of 

attorney member

 was added to make it clear that national support center board members do not have to be admitted to practice in a state
where the center actually provides legal assistance. 
Section 1607.2(c). The definition of 

eligible client member

 has been changed in two principal ways. First, the language has been revised to make it clear that client board members
must be eligible at the time of their appointment to each term of office. Thus, a client member who is financially eligible
for services when first appointed to a recipient's board may not be reappointed to a second or subsequent term if, at
the time of reappointment, the client board member is no longer financially eligible for LSC-funded services. However,
nothing in the rule would require a client board member to resign during the course of a term if the client became ineligible
subsequent to appointment. Second, language was added to deal with two additional, distinct issues. The proposed
rule now makes it clear that the recipient should decide how client board member eligibility is determined. The proposed
rule also makes it clear that the recipient should decide whether it or a particular group should make the determination,
and that the recipient could decide, for some groups, the recipient will make the determination and for others it will
leave the determination up to the appointing group.

The Committee considered and decided not to expand the definition of 

eligible client member

 to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services provided by the recipient, because it wished
to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the poor community. 
Section 1607.2(d). The proposal revises the definition of 

governing body

 to clarify that, in addition to the governing bodies of recipients who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal
assistance to eligible clients, it also applies to the governing bodies or policy boards created pursuant to  1607.6(e).

Section 1607.2(e). This definition of 

recipient

 appears in 45 CFR part 1600, but is repeated here for clarity in interpreting this part. 



Section 1607.3 Composition 


Section 1607.3(a). The proposal includes general language, applicable to all categories of board membership, that
requires board members to be supportive of the purposes of the LSC Act, and to be interested in and knowledgeable about
the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current regulation does not include any similar requirement
for client board members, but does include similar, although not identical, requirements for attorney and ``other''
board members. The proposal removes the reference to the board reflecting ``the characteristics'' of the client
community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part because it could be construed to be inconsistent
with diversity requirements that are included later in the rule for each category of board membership. 
Section 1607.3(b). With respect to attorney board members, the proposal revises the language of the rule that is based
on the requirements of the McCollum Amendment, which require a majority of the board members to be appointed by state,
county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies that the appointments can be made by one or more such
bar associations, so long as those bar associations collectively represent a majority of attorneys practicing law
in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based bar associations that represent attorneys
practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included in the mix of bar associations that make
appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion would help to insure that there is
appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although the rule, consistent with the
language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the ``governing bodies'' of the
bar associations, the Committee recognizes that different bar associations should be free to exercise their appointment
responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices. The McCollum Amendment
does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association. 
The proposed rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum amendment that makes it clear that national
support centers are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to
appoint their attorney members, simply because they provide service nationally. The proposed rule also recognizes
that some recipients, especially Native-American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide
services in one or more adjacent or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide,
to have the bar associations of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of
the state in which their principal office is located. 
In addition, the proposed rule explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e.,
that the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum amendment,
may be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The proposed rule does change current law with
respect to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation,
the additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools.
This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under the proposed regulation, the recipient may select attorneys
who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated
with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area,
and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient would
be able to select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and may be helpful in fundraising,
or lawyers who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and may be helpful in designing a recipient's
private attorney involvement program. 
Finally, the proposed regulation revises and relocates the section that relates to diversity among attorney board
members. This provision is a variation of the language previously found in  1607.3(c). It is revised to incorporate
a more current statement of the concerns addressed by that subsection, but no substantive change is intended. While
the language of the proposed rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity and gender, it also includes a reference
to other factors that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by the recipient,
including, for example, age, physical abilities and religious belief. 
Section 1607.3(c). The proposal includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members.
The principal revision addresses an issue that has remained ambiguous under the language of the current regulation
and has caused problems for some LSC recipients. The proposed revision would codify the current LSC interpretation
of the language to require that client board members be selected by client groups that have been designated by the recipient.
This proposal also adds language that more accurately reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate
client groups for purposes of eligible client member selection. In addition, the proposal adds a diversity goal for
client board members that is similar to the requirement for attorney board members.

Section 1607.3(d). With respect to the ``other'' board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor
eligible client members, the proposal makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill the remaining ``other''
slots. This gives recipients flexibility to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community
relations, coordination with other social service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors
who cannot count as ``attorney members'' because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's
service area, could be selected for this category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current
regulation, this provision is consistent with longstanding LSC interpretations. In addition, the proposal includes
language that makes it clear that ``other'' board members should be selected with the goals of diversity in mind. 
Section 1607.3(e). This proposal adds language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make
it clear that the provision was not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide
client council as the appointing organization for client board members, so long as that client council represents
numerous smaller client groups. 
Section 1607.3(f). The proposal deletes language which could be incorrectly interpreted to give LSC authority to
veto particular methods of selecting local board members. In addition, the proposal states affirmatively that recipients
may recommend names to and consult with bar associations and other appointing groups to insure that appropriate appointments
are made. This revision recognizes that bar associations or other groups may request information on who would make
a good legal services program board member and may rely on input from the recipients in making the appointments. 
Section 1607.3(g). The proposed rule includes a new provision that is intended to establish standards for dealing
with recipient board vacancies. It establishes a standard of reasonable and good faith efforts to insure that governing
body vacancies are filled promptly, but recognizes that recipients often have no control over the appointment process
other than to change the groups that they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make
an appointment in a timely manner. In order to avoid the creation of vacancies, recipients, through their own by-laws
or board policies, could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow in making appointments,
refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. For example, a recipient's board could permit its
members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could make short-term interim appointments, if necessary,
until regular appointments can be made. 
Section 1607.3(h). The proposed regulation includes a new provision that grants the recipient the authority to reject
an appointment of a board member when the recipient determines that the person who has been appointed does not meet
the criteria set out in the regulation, including financial eligibility for client board members, or where the person
appointed has a significant individual or institutional conflict of interest with the recipient or its client community.
The ABA's Standards for Providers of Legal Services to the Poor states, in Standard 7.2-5, that ``governing
body members should not knowingly attempt to influence any decisions in which they have a conflict of interest with
provider clients'' and Standard 7.2-6 states that ``members should not be selected by * * * any
institution or agency which is in conflict with the provider or its clients.'' The Commentary to those standards contains
discussions of both institutional and individual conflicts of interest and suggests that when such conflicts arise
with respect to a sitting board member, the member and the recipient should be guided by laws of the jurisdiction regarding
disclosure and recusal. While the Standards state an absolute rule prohibiting appointments by institutions or
agencies that have a conflict with the recipient or its clients (e.g. a welfare department or county attorney's office
should not make appointments to a recipient's board), they also note that:

 

If a person is employed by or is otherwise significantly connected with an institution that is in conflict with the
provider's clients, generally that person should not serve on the governing body. That person may serve, however,
if there is evidence * * * that the particular individual is not in actual conflict * * *.




Thus, the question of whether it is appropriate for government attorneys or other public employees or elected officials,
or attorneys representing finance companies or real estate developers, to serve on recipient governing bodies as
members appointed by a bar association as its representative is a factual issue. The Commentary recognizes that:

 

(c)onflicts may arise in the representation by attorney board members of institutions or individuals who are in conflict
with provider clients. Concern about the risks associated with conflicts should not exclude from the governing body
every person identified with an institution or individual with an adverse interest. A strict rule could exclude persons
with skills and experience of benefit to the provider and could inhibit development of an effective relationship
between the provider and the private bar. In rural areas particularly, where the pool of potential members is relatively
small, it may be impossible to avoid all conflicts. The provider, however, should assure that the presence of members
with potential conflicts does not inhibit forceful representation of clients.

 

The proposed provision suggests a way that, under appropriate circumstances, the recipient can assure that individuals
with clear and substantial conflicts of interest do not serve on its governing body, while permitting it to seat other
individuals who may have a less substantial or merely potential conflict, and leaving it to the guidance of the applicable
rules of professional responsibility when actual conflicts arise.

Section 1607.4 Functions of a Governing Body


Section 1607.4(a). This proposal deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven
to be a difficult concept to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Committee felt that truly effective public
notice is virtually impossible to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation
does not wish to promote such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because
few members of the public showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior
public notice, so that recipients would only be required to do what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances.

The Committee also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds
of matters were properly discussed in executive session. Instead, it decided to recommend that recipients look to
the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act
provisions, or other provisions in state non-profit corporation law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that should
appropriately be discussed out of the public eye. A recipient should determine, based on that review and local circumstances,
how it should conduct its business. 
Section 1607.4(b). The proposed regulation includes new language to make it clear that recipient governing bodies
have, in addition to the specific functions described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent
in their status as boards of non-profit corporations. The Committee felt that the current regulatory language did
not grant the governing body the general authority, for example, to hire and fire a program's executive director,
and there should be language that granted such authority. 
In addition, there is new language that was added to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing
bodies of legal assistance programs under the Model Rules, especially with respect to the governing bodies' interference
with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct of any ongoing representation. The Committee wished
to make clear that while Board members were prohibited from such interference, the Board as a whole should be encouraged
to adopt policies to guide the executive director's actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken
representation in a case that is inappropriate under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations. 
Section 1607.4(c). This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws.
The Corporation would have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any revisions that are made in them, for
the purpose of ensuring that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations. 


Section 1607.5 Compensation 


Section 1607.5(a). The proposed regulation makes two significant changes in the current rule dealing with recipient
board member compensation. First, since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only to
attorney board members, it would be consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or
other non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. The regulation was revised to
make it consistent with the restriction in the Act. 
Second, this proposal reverses the policy decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the language of
the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just the one on
whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting on state
and national support center boards, and vice versa. It prevented support centers from being accountable through
their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This proposed language restores and clarifies the prior
LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services
Corporation Reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent
with the proposed revision. 
In addition, the proposal clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual
expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Such a per diem may
be easier for programs to administer and may encourage board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging
by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. The last phrase of the sentence was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement
could be made for expenses incurred by recipient board members, on the same terms and conditions that are applicable
to non-board members when such board members are involved in other program activities not directly related to their
board membership or service, e.g., attorney board members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or
a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on
behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference.

Sections 1607.5 (b) and (c). The proposal includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition
relates to a recipient's private attorney involvement program. One provision makes it clear that the Corporation
could partially waive the compensation prohibition for those rural programs that operate in areas where there are
so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program boards if that means
that their partners and associates are barred from participating in judicare or other compensated PAI activities.
The second provision was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases
and participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly
important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys. 




Section 1607.6 Waiver

<TEXT>
 

Section 1607.6(a). There is no change in this waiver provision which was designed to cover those programs, primarily
reservation-based Native-American programs, that existed prior to the creation of the Corporation and had nonattorney
majorities on their boards. In lieu of attorneys, most of those programs include tribal advocates who practice in
tribal courts. 
Section 1607.6(b). This new provision was added to permit the Corporation president the discretion to waive the requirement
of one-third client membership when the president has determined that a recipient, like the National Clearinghouse
for Legal Services or the Food Research & Action Center (``FRAC''), does not have as a primary purpose the provision
of legal assistance to clients. The waiver provision requires a specific determination by the Corporation president,
rather than a self-determination by the recipient, and does not permit waiver of the client board member requirement
so long as the recipient has as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to clients. Such a waiver does not
conflict with the statutory provision governing client membership because that provision applies only to those
recipients that are organized ``solely for the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients.'' It is anticipated
that this waiver will be used sparingly for exceptional circumstances. 
Section 1607.6(c). This provision was revised to clarify that the Corporation president could waive any provisions
of the regulation, as long as the waiver conforms with applicable law. It also allows partial waivers to be granted.
In addition, language was added to make it clear that the nature of the legal community could be considered as a basis
for a waiver, as well as requirements of state law. The Committee recognized that there may be programs, especially
in rural areas, where there are peculiar problems or situations within the legal community that may make it necessary
or desirable to permit the recipient to have a governing board that varies from the normal. An example would be for those
programs that serve native-American populations and practice in tribal courts. The president, through the waiver
authority, could permit the recipient to substitute one or more tribal advocates for attorney board members. In addition,
this provision could be used as authority for partial waiver of the compensation prohibition, to permit a recipient
to adopt policies that would allow partners or associates of a board member to participate in compensated PAI activities
supported by the recipient. 
Section 1607.6(d). The only change made in this subsection was a reference to the previous subsection. 
Section 1607.6(e). This new provision was added to permit the LSC president to require an organization that is not
principally a legal assistance organization but gets an LSC grant for legal assistance activities, to set up a policy
board, similar to those established for several of the Delivery Systems Study programs during the late 1970's, to
govern the activities covered by the LSC grant. 


Deletion of Section 1607.7 Compliance 


The compliance section of the current regulation is no longer applicable, since it refers to the changes that were
made in the regulation in 1983. None of the proposed revisions would require programs to change anything about their
board structures in order to come into compliance, although they would permit programs to make numerous changes and
still remain in compliance with the regulation. Therefore the Committee proposal deletes the provisions on compliance.
The Corporation should insure compliance with the new regulation in the same manner as it insures compliance with
the other regulations.

 1607.3 

Composition. 


(a) A recipient shall be incorporated in a State in which it provides legal assistance, and shall have a governing body
that reasonably reflects the interests of the eligible clients in the area served and consists of members, each of
whom is supportive of the purposes of the Act and has an interest in, and knowledge of, the delivery of quality legal
services to the poor. 
(b) At least sixty percent (60%) of a governing body shall be attorney members. 
(1) A majority of the members of the governing body shall be attorney members appointed by the governing body(ies)
of one or more State, county or municipal bar associations, the membership of which represents a majority of attorneys
practicing law in the localities in which the recipient provides legal assistance. 
(i) Appointments may be made either by the bar association which represents a majority of attorneys in the recipient's
service area or by bar associations which collectively represent a majority of the attorneys practicing law in the
recipient's service area. 
(ii) Recipients that provide legal assistance in more than one State may provide that appointments of attorney members
be made by the appropriate bar association(s) in the State(s) or locality(ies) in which the recipient's principal
office is located or in which the recipient provides legal assistance. 
(2) Any additional attorney members may be selected by the recipient's governing body or may be appointed by other
organizations that are designated by the recipient and have an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor.

(3) Appointments shall be made so as to insure that the attorney members reasonably reflect the diversity of the legal
community and the population of the areas served by the recipient, including race, ethnicity, gender and other factors.

(c) At least one-third of the members of a recipient's governing body shall be eligible clients when appointed. The

which advocate for or deliver services or resources to the client community served by the recipient. Recipients shall
designate groups in a manner that reflects, to the extent possible, the variety of interests within the client community,
and eligible client members should be selected so that they reasonably reflect the diversity of the eligible client
population served by the recipient, including race, gender, ethnicity and other factors. 
(d) The remaining members of a governing body may be appointed by the recipient's governing body or selected in a manner
described in the recipient's bylaws or policies, and the appointment or selection shall be made so that the governing
body as a whole reasonably reflects the diversity of the areas served by the recipient, including race, ethnicity,
gender and other factors.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</USDEPT>











Concurrent Use of Transmitters in Common Carrier and Non-Common Carrier Service



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule making proceeding proposes to allow transmitters authorized under part 22 to be concurrently licensed
and used for both common carrier and private carrier operations. The purpose of this proposed rule is to promote economic
efficiencies for carriers in providing paging services. This proposed action will lead to more effective use of carrier
resources without undermining the Commission's rules.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order (NPRM and Order) in CC Docket 94-46,
adopted May 13, 1994 and released June 9, 1994. The full text of Commission decisions are available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC. The
complete text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20037.


Paperwork Reduction




The proposed action does not impose a paperwork burden on the public.


Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, the Commission's initial regulatory
flexibility analysis follows:


Reasons for Action and Objective




This rule making proceeding is initiated to obtain comment regarding changes in the provision of common carrier and
private carrier paging services through the use of a single transmitter. The purpose of the proposed rule is to promote
economic efficiencies for carriers in providing paging services.


Legal Basis



The proposed action is authorized under Section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.
154(j), 303(r).


Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements



None.


Federal Rules Which Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules


None.


Description, Potential Impact, and Number of Small Entities Involved




A rule change in this proceeding would benefit providers of common carrier and private carrier paging services by
reducing costs. A number of these providers are small entities.


Any Significant Alternative Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent with the Stated Objectives



We have determined no specific alternative. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
will be served with a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Order in accordance with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a).


Synopsis of NPRM and Order



By this NPRM and Order, the Commission proposes to delete 22.119 of the Rules, which prohibits the concurrent licensing
and use of transmitters for common carrier and non-common carrier purposes. In this regard, the Commission notes
that several factors make it appropriate to reevaluate the  22.119 prohibition and to propose deleting or modifying
the rule. First, advances in technology, such as improved digital transmission techniques and store and forward
technology, have resulted in dramatically increased capacity, thus reducing the need for a transmitter to be devoted
on a full-time basis to common carrier uses. Second, licensees providing wider-area service could achieve substantial
economies of scale by sharing transmitters when building out a regional or nationwide system without diminishing
the licensee's current quality of service. Third, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (1993 Budget Act)
enacted by Congress amends Section 3(n) and Section 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 to create a comprehensive
framework for all mobile services. The Commission has initiated several rulemakings to implement the provision
of Section 3(n) and 332 of the Act, as amended by the 1993 Budget Act. Lastly, increased competition in the industry
provides an assurance that service to existing customers will not suffer from joint use of transmitters when the carriers
are offering distinct services on different frequencies. Because of these factors, the NPRM and Order tentatively
concludes that permitting a single transmitter to operate on both common carrier and private channels will cause
no disruption or impairment of service to existing part 22 subscribers. Nevertheless, the NPRM and Order seeks comment
on whether the proposed rules should be limited to circumstances where the joint use will facilitate the provision
of national and or regional service as an overly to local paging service or where the part 22 licensee is utilizing batched
paging.


Ordering Clauses



Accordingly, 

it is ordered

 that pursuant to Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(j), 303(r),
this Notice of Proposed Rule Making is issued.

Eagle Transportation Permits for American Indians and Public Institutions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to revise the general eagle permit restrictions applicable to American Indians
and public institutions. The Service proposes to issue permits of limited duration and conditions, for the transportation
into and out of the United States of eagle parts, nests or eggs or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs of the
bald eagle (

Haliaeetus leucocephalus

) or the golden eagle (

Aquila chrysaetos

) that are lawfully possessed by American Indians and public institutions.



The proposed regulation will provide for eagle permits to be issued only for transportation into and out of the United
States when the eagle parts have religious significance or value, or are being transported by a public institution
for scientific or exhibition purposes. The Service makes this proposal in order to address the concerns which have
been expressed by American Indians and public institutions who have sought the Service's permission for the international
travel of lawfully possessed eagle parts or other articles containing eagle parts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



The golden eagle and most notably the bald eagle are proud symbols of our nation's natural beauty, our democratic form
of government and our national heritage. The bald eagle was selected by the Continental Congress in 1782 as our national
symbol and was given special protection by Congress in the Eagle Act of June 8, 1940. The Act as originally enacted provides
that the Secretary of Interior may permit the taking and possession of bald eagle specimens for the scientific or exhibition
purposes of public museums, scientific societies, and zoological parks.

The Eagle Act was amended by Congress on October 24, 1962 (16 U.S.C. 668a) to include the golden eagle within its provisions
and to permit the taking, possession, and transportation of eagle specimens for the religious purposes of Indian
tribes.



Summary of Comments and Information Received



On Thursday, November 14, 1991, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of Intent to Review 50 CFR part 22 (56 FR 57872). In this notice the Service requested that all interested parties
submit written comments. In response to this request the Service received six comments pertaining to 50 CFR part 22.
The Service has carefully considered all comments received in response to the November 14, 1991, 

Federal Register

 notice in proposing these changes to part 22.

In making this proposal the Service has carefully considered the recommendations made by commentaries in response
to the Notice of Intent to Review published on Thursday November 14, 1991, 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 57872). The Service invites comments on this proposed rule and on all comments pertaining to Part 22, summarized
herein, submitted in response to the Notice of Intent to Review.

Comments Pertaining to Section 22.21. Permits for Scientific or Exhibition Purposes



Several comments were received on the proposed revision of Section 22.21. One recommendation was that  22.21,
Permits for Scientific or Exhibition Purposes, limiting possession of bald or golden eagles to museums, public scientific
societies and zoological parks, should be amended to allow eagles to be placed in private institutions. The commenter
noted that there has been an increased number of birds that are for various reasons non-releasable and hard to place
into public institutions. The Service does not anticipate changing the current regulations to allow for the placement
of eagles with private institutions. The Service has been successful in placing non-releasable birds in public institutions
in the past and expects the availability of these types of placements to continue. Public institutions have been the
placement of preference for such birds because they usually provide a greater opportunity for the citizens of the
United States to enjoy the rare beauty of these birds.



Comments Pertaining to Section 22.22. Permits for Indian Religious Purposes



One commenter requested that the Service include language within the regulations that would make it easier for tribal
members to obtain eagle feathers. The Service has striven to make its current procedures as fair and equitable as possible
in light of the limited supply and the increasing demand for eagle feathers. The Service is working with the tribal
entities to make substantive changes in its policies.

Another recommendation was that Service procedures be revised to allow American Indians who find dead eagles to have
the same eagle they found returned, because of what was termed, the found eagle's ``spiritual and cultural'' significance
to individual American Indians. The Service recognizes and has carefully considered the concern raised. The Service
is presently reviewing its policies and procedures to provide for this special need and allow American Indians to
pick up and keep eagles found dead on tribal lands. The Service is also making administrative changes to allocate more
resources to the National Eagle Repository and to simplify the entire eagle permit process for the religious use of
American Indians. The Service will continue to work with tribal entities to develop recommendations to enhance these
initial efforts.

Another recommendation was to revise the applicant certification requirement and permit issuance criteria set
out in  22.22. The Service has traditionally followed, as a matter of policy, guidelines established by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (Bureau) in reviewing such matters. These same guidelines are used by the Bureau to determine
the status of an individual seeking federal assistance. The Bureau's certification simply indicates that an applicant
is a member of a federally-recognized tribe in good standing. The establishment of an additional set of guidelines
for the sole purpose of the allocation of eagles feathers would be redundant and inconsistent with the equitable standards
set out by the Bureau. The Service, therefore, will continue to defer to the Bureau's criteria and anticipates no changes
in the current certification requirements.

A recommendation was also made to include language allowing tribal members who lack proper paperwork to prove that
they have permission from the Service to possess eagle feathers. Under current regulations, bald eagle parts, nests,
or eggs lawfully acquired prior to June 8, 1940, and golden eagles parts, nests or eggs lawfully acquired prior to October
24, 1962, may be possessed, or transported within the United States without a Federal permit. Except for the above
stated exceptions, a valid permit for American Indian religious purposes is required. No change in these provisions
are anticipated at this time.



Comments Pertaining to Section 22.23. Permits to Take Depredating Eagles



Another recommendation relating to part 22 was the suggestion that the Service should include within the current
issuance criteria required for Permits to take depredating eagles, in  22.23(a), an additional permit criteria
requiring the applicant to provide documentation of other methods that were attempted to reduce depredations. The
Service anticipates no changes in the permit criteria for permits to take depredating eagles at this time. The Service
considers the factual inquiry already required under existing application criteria to be sufficient to assure the
continued protection of wild eagle populations.

Comments were also received on the subject of the use of eagles in falconry. Specific comments were that the Service
should relax and simplify the requirements necessary for obtaining permits for golden eagles used in falconry for
falconers who want to fly eagles. The Service considers current permit requirements as generally necessary and proper
in order to assure the safety and welfare of both the eagle and the falconer. In the Service's considered view, any relaxation
of these standards to allow other than master class falconers to possess golden eagles for falconry could be detrimental
to the bird and the handler. Therefore, no changes to this effect are anticipated within the regulation at this time.

Another commenter recommended that eagles taken under permits, pursuant to  22.23(b)(3), Permits to take
depredating eagles, should be made available for scientific purposes, including deposition in a museum. In the Service's
experience, the demand for eagles and eagle parts by American Indians is greater than the supply. The Service, therefore,
has an obligation to fulfill the religious needs of the American Indian before alternative depositions are considered.
Therefore, the Service does not anticipate making any changes at this time.



Need for Proposed Rulemaking



The Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to amend the regulations restricting the issuance of eagle permits, in order
to respond to the particular needs of American Indians and public institutions. In order to assist the legitimate
needs of American Indians and public institutions for bald or golden eagle feathers and other parts, the Service currently
provides for the issuance of permits to American Indians and public institutions to possess bald and golden eagle
feathers or parts. Under the permit system the possession and transportation within the United States of eagle feathers
and parts is legal, but they may not be imported, exported, purchased, sold, traded, bartered or offered for purchase,
sale, trade or barter. The Service has established an eagle repository for eagle parts at the Clark R. Bavin National
Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory in Ashland, Oregon, where American Indians through the permit process may
lawfully obtain feathers and other parts, nests or eggs of eagles.

American Indians and representatives of public institutions in the past have sought the Service's permission to
travel internationally with their lawfully possessed bald or golden eagle feathers, parts, eggs, nests or other
articles which may contain eagle parts. A change in the permit requirements was necessitated because the regulations,
as they currently exist, do not authorize the transportation into or out of the United States of religiously significant
bald or golden eagle parts or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs by American Indians, or the transportation
into or out of the United States or bald or golden eagle parts or articles containing such parts, nests or eggs for scientific
or exhibition purposes. The Service, therefore, proposes to make accommodations for the religious needs of the American
Indian community and for public institutions by making changes in the eagle permit regulations that generally prohibit
all imports and exports of eagle parts, nests or eggs and do not differentiate between transportation within and transportation
outside the United States.

The Service proposes to amend the regulations to provide for the issuance of eagle permits when the parts are lawfully
possessed by American Indians and public institutions for the transportation into and out of the United States. The
intent or the end result of the transportation into and out of the United States by American Indians and public institutions
shall not be, under any circumstance, for the purchase, sale, barter or trade of bald eagle or golden eagle parts, nests
or eggs.

The Service proposes to provide that eagle permits of limited duration may be issued under substantially the same
general requirements and conditions applicable to the domestic possession and transportation of such articles
by American Indians and public institutions. The Service hopes that this revision of the regulation will facilitate
the international travel of American Indians and representatives of public institutions. The Service believes
that it can serve its mandate to protect and preserve the viability of bald eagle or golden eagle populations and at
the same time provided for a reasonable and proper balance of regulations which address the legitimate needs of the
American Indian community and public institutions. In addition to the above changes, several references within
the Sections have been updated or more clearly stated.



Required Determinations





Note.

 This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under Executive Order 12866. The Department
of the Interior (Department) certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). This action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630. The only effect
of this rule will be to make it easier for American Indians and public institutions to travel or move internationally
with lawfully possessed articles containing bald or golden eagle parts. This proposed rule does not contain any additional
information collection requirements, beyond those approved under OMB approval Number 1018-0022, that would
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). This action does not contain any federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. These proposed changes
in the regulations in Part 22 are regulatory and enforcement actions which are covered by a categorical exclusion
from National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 516 Departmental Manual. An Environmental Action Memorandum
is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office in Arlington, Virginia. The determination has been made pursuant
to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act that the proposed revision to Part 22 will not effect a federally listed species.



Civil Justice Reform_Executive Order 12778



In revising these regulations the Service has made every reasonable effort in formulating these proposals to ensure
that these regulations:

(A) Have no preemptive effects upon other regulations not being revised herein.

(B) The major effects upon Federal regulations is to provide eagle permits for the transportation into and out of the
United States with lawfully obtained bald and golden eagle parts, nests, and eggs, for American Indian tribe religious
use and public institutions for scientific and exhibition purposes.

(C) The standards proposed in this proposed revision are intended to articulate a precise and understandable criterion
of what transportation into and out of the United States is being regulated and how the affected interests may conform
their activities and comply with applicable eagle permit regulations. This standard will promote regulatory simplification
and burden reduction upon affected interests by providing notice:

(1) That members of American Indian tribes and public institutions may now take their lawfully obtained eagle parts,
nests, eggs, or items containing such with them when they travel outside the territory of the United States;

(2) That, a Service eagle permit is required in order to transport eagle parts, nests, or eggs into or out of the United
States;

(3) That the Service will issue such permits under specified permit ``Issuance criteria'' stated in 50 CFR 22.22(c);

(4) That permits for the transportation of eagle parts, nests, or eggs into and out of the United States will be of certain
and limited duration; and

(5) That the import, export purchase, sale, barter, or trade, of eagle parts, nests, or eggs shall remain prohibited
by regulation.

(D) These proposed changes to the regulations in title 50 CFR part 22 are intended to have no retroactive effect directly
or indirectly.

(E) The Service Administrative procedures for permit application, issuance, revocation, denial, and appeal are
set out in title 50 CFR part 13. No additional Administrative procedures are anticipated for exhaustion of remedies.

(F) All key terms have been defined within the CFR.

Atlantic Tuna Fisheries


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS proposes modifications to NOAA Form 370, Fisheries Certificate of Origin (FCO), to allow that form to also serve
as a Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document (BSD), and proposes amendments to the regulations governing the Atlantic
and Pacific bluefin tuna fisheries to require: An appropriately completed, approved BSD as a condition for import,
export, or re-export of fresh or frozen bluefin tuna into or from the United States; a Federal permit for all dealers
that export Pacific bluefin tuna; preparation and submission of a biweekly report on exports of Pacific bluefin tuna
by permitted dealers; and affixation of an identification tag to fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna
sold for export.


The amendments would enable the United States to assist the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
Tunas (ICCAT) in accounting for all bluefin tuna entering into commerce or international trade and would bring the
United States into compliance with the 1992 recommendation of ICCAT and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (ATCA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Atlantic tuna fisheries are managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 285 issued under the authority of ATCA. ATCA
authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to implement regulations as may be necessary to carry out the recommendations
of ICCAT. The authority to implement ICCAT recommendations has been delegated from the Secretary to the Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA).


Purpose


Parties to the Eighth Special Meeting of ICCAT held in Madrid, Spain, on November 8-12, 1992, adopted a recommendation
to implement a statistical documentation program to collect more complete information on the catch of, and trade
in, Atlantic bluefin tuna. That recommendation, which this proposed rule would implement, requires Contracting
Parties to implement a statistical documentation program whereby any bluefin tuna imported into the territory of
a Contracting Party or at the first entry into a regional economic organization must be accompanied by an appropriately
completed BSD. The ICCAT recommendation is based on the need to improve the reliability of statistical information
on worldwide harvests of bluefin tuna, particularly western Atlantic bluefin tuna, which is an overexploited stock.
Without statistical documentation and differentiation with respect to ocean area of catch, ICCAT cannot determine
the total harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna. While the primary market for bluefin tuna is Japan, which is a member country
of ICCAT, the origin of all bluefin tuna on the international market cannot be ascertained without documentation
of the flag state of harvesting vessels and ocean areas of catch. Some vessels that harvest bluefin tuna are registered
to nations not affiliated with ICCAT and are not subject to ICCAT quota constraints; some of these nations have difficulty
in obtaining information on the catches of vessels under their flag and therefore do not report catches to ICCAT.
The documentation requirement would facilitate accounting for all fresh or frozen shipments of bluefin tuna into
Japan and other ICCAT countries, by both member and non-member ICCAT countries. This information would be used by
ICCAT for Atlantic bluefin tuna stock assessments, to develop management policies, and to help determine compliance
with its conservation program for Atlantic bluefin tuna.
In addition to the proposed BSD requirement, NMFS proposes to require a Federal permit for each dealer who exports
Pacific bluefin tuna. NMFS also proposes to require these dealers to complete a biweekly report on bluefin tuna exports
and to affix a tag on all fresh or individually frozen Pacific bluefin tuna sold for export. When combined with the existing
permitting and reporting requirements for Atlantic bluefin tuna dealers, this would give NMFS the ability to track
all bluefin tuna shipments imported into, exported, or re-exported from the United States.
NMFS has determined that these additional requirements would bring the United States into compliance with the 1992
ICCAT recommendation that all bluefin tuna (Atlantic and Pacific) imported into ICCAT countries be required to be
accompanied by a BSD. ICCAT has determined that inclusion of Pacific bluefin is necessary due to the similarity of
appearance of the two subspecies. Without Pacific bluefin tuna dealer permits, bi-weekly reports and tags for exports,
the United States could not assure compliance with the documentation requirement for Pacific bluefin.


Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document


The proposed rule would require a completed, approved BSD as a condition for the import, export, or re-export of all
bluefin tuna shipments into or from the United States. The BSD would be required to accompany each fresh or frozen shipment
along with other shipping documentation ordinarily required for international trade. Consistent with the ICCAT
recommendation and subsequent agreements with Japan and Canada, the BSD would be required for all bluefin tuna beginning
June 1, 1994.
The BSD would be required for all fresh or frozen bluefin tuna products that are exported from or imported into the United
States and identified by Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) numbers for fresh or chilled bluefin tuna, excluding fillets
and other fish meat_0302.39.00.20; and frozen bluefin tuna, excluding fillets_0303.49.00.20.


Contents of Document


NMFS proposes to modify the FCO (NOAA Form 370) so that it can also serve as the BSD. Interested persons may obtain copies
of the proposed combined form from NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

).
In order to be considered appropriately completed, the approved BSD accompanying each shipment would have to provide
all of the required information indicated in the proposed regulatory text for  285.202 and be certified by the
exporter, importer, and government official, as applicable.


Validation


The completed, approved BSD would have to be validated by a responsible government official of the country whose flag
vessel harvested the tuna regardless of where the bluefin tuna is first landed, unless the AA waives the validation
requirement for that country because the AA finds, based on information from ICCAT, that: (1) All fresh or
individually frozen bluefin tuna available for sale from that country are tagged, or included in an ICCAT-accepted
logbook or ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system; (2) all information relating to the tag, the ICCAT-accepted
logbook, or the ICCAT-accepted information retrieval system is compiled by the government of that country and includes
the name of the country issuing the document, the name of the exporter and the importer, the name of the harvesting vessel
and the area of harvest, the gear utilized, the type of product and total weight, and the point of export; and (3) the
compiled information is provided in a timely fashion to ICCAT. Validation requirements would be waived for all but
bulk-frozen shipments upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 of a finding and waiver by the AA.


Dolphin-Safe Tuna Designation


Under the Marine Mammal Protection and International Dolphin Conservation Acts and their implementing regulations,
only dolphin-safe tuna may be purchased, sold, transported, or shipped in the United States after June 1, 1994 (16
U.S.C. 1417). All shipments of tuna and tuna products, except fresh tuna, from all countries must be accompanied by
an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). As proposed to be revised, NOAA Form 370 would serve as an FCO/BSD and
appropriately completing the form would satisfy both FCO requirements and, if bluefin tuna, BSD requirements.
All fresh tuna and other fresh fish products are presumed to be captured by dolphin-safe methods and do not require
an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370) for lawful importation to the United States. In addition, imports
of certain fish and fish products other than tuna, except fresh fish, as specified at 50 CFR 216.24(e), from countries
having registered vessels that use large-scale driftnets (no countries so designated at this time) must be accompanied
by an appropriately completed FCO (NOAA Form 370). Although an FCO is not required for fresh tuna or any other fresh
fish products, under the proposed rule an appropriately completed BSD (NOAA Form 370 as proposed to be revised) would
be required for all bluefin tuna, fresh or frozen, that enters or exits the United States. Exhibit 1 below summarizes
when a completed FCO or BSD, that is, an appropriately completed NOAA Form 370, as proposed to be revised, is required.





Responsible Parties


For the purposes of the exporter's certification, the exporter would be considered the person or company that first
exported the shipment from the country where the fish is first landed.
For the purposes of the importer's certification, intermediate country importer(s) would be the person(s) or company(ies)
that transship(s) the product through an intermediate country(ies). An intermediate country would be a country
from which bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products that were previously imported (i.e., not harvested or landed) by
that country are exported to the United States. An intermediate country for the purposes of these proposed 50 CFR part
285 regulations is distinct from an intermediary nation as defined in section 3 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act
and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 216. Shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products through a nation
on a through bill of lading, or in any other manner that does not enter the products into that country's customs territory
as an import, would not make that country an intermediate country under this definition.
For the purposes of the importer's certification, the final destination importer would be the person or company that
is the recipient of the product at its final destination (i.e., country of consumption).


Pacific Bluefin Tuna Dealer Requirements


Permit Requirements


Dealers purchasing or receiving Pacific bluefin tuna for export would be required to possess a valid bluefin tuna
dealer permit and comply with all applicable reporting requirements.


Tagging Requirements


The proposed rule would require that identification tags be placed on all bluefin tuna, except bulk-frozen bluefin,
landed by U.S. vessels and exported from the United States, regardless of ocean area of catch. Similar to the NMFS Northeast
Region program for dealers purchasing Atlantic bluefin tuna, the Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director)
would issue numbered tags to each person receiving a dealer's permit for exporting Pacific bluefin tuna. Such tags
would not be transferable. A dealer or agent would be required to affix a tag to each fresh or individually frozen Pacific
bluefin tuna purchased, or received, for export, except bulk-frozen Pacific bluefin tuna, immediately upon its
offloading from a vessel. The tag would be required to be affixed between the fifth dorsal finlet and the keel.
Individual Pacific bluefin tuna carcasses that are landed in bulk-frozen form would not be required to be tagged for
export. A tagging requirement for individual fish frozen in bulk would be difficult to implement and enforce, and
would require a drastic change in current handling practice. However, exported bulk-frozen shipments would be accompanied
by a completed BSD.
A tag affixed to any Pacific bluefin tuna would have to remain on the tuna until the tuna is cut into portions, which NMFS
understands may occur on occasion. If the tuna or tuna parts subsequently are packaged for transport for domestic
commercial use or for export, the tag number would be required to be written legibly and indelibly on the outside of
any package or container. Tag numbers would be required to be recorded on any document accompanying shipment of bluefin
tuna for U.S. commercial use or export.


Reporting Requirements


Pacific bluefin tuna dealers would be exempted from the requirement at 50 CFR 285.29(a) to record and report bluefin
tuna landings via the Daily Dealer Report Card. However, they would be required to submit biweekly reports on exports
of bluefin tuna to the Regional Director. The report would have to be postmarked and mailed within 10 days after the
end of each 2-week reporting period in which Pacific bluefin tuna were exported. The biweekly reporting periods would
be defined as the first day to the fourteenth day of each month and the fifteenth day to the last day of the month. Each
report would have to specify accurately and completely for each tuna or each shipment of bulk-frozen tuna exported:
Date of landing or import; any tag number (if so tagged); and weight in pounds (specify if round or dressed).
Dealers would be required to allow an authorized officer, or any employee of NMFS designated by the Regional Director
for this purpose, to inspect and copy any records of transfers, purchases, or receipts of Pacific bluefin tuna. Finally,
the dealer would be required to maintain a copy of each biweekly report for a period of 6 months from the date on which
it was submitted to the Regional Director.


Ports of Entry


To facilitate enforcement, the AA may, in the future, designate ports of entry. If ports of entry are designated, all
bluefin tuna shipments entering the United States would be restricted to the designated ports of entry, which would
be published in the 

Federal Register

.


Enforcement


Any fresh or frozen bluefin tuna product identified by the HTS item numbers referred to previously that is unaccompanied
by a completed, approved BSD would be considered unlawful for importation into the United States. If the AA has designated
ports of entry for shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products, any shipment arriving at non-designated ports
of entry would be considered unlawful and the importer would be subject to penalties under ATCA. 
When a bluefin tuna is presented for entry into the customs territory of the United States and is found to be without
a completed, approved BSD, U.S. Customs would suspend entry authorization, notify the importer of record of the documentation
deficiency, notify NMFS enforcement agents of the deficiency, and offer the importer of record the opportunity to
cure the defect. If the importer of record cannot cure the defect within 8 hours (justified by perishable nature of
product), the importer could withdraw the product from U.S. Customs territory (i.e., re-export within 24 hours under
Customs supervision); place the product into a bonded warehouse; post a bond to release the product; or abandon the
product (Customs takes custody), whereupon the product would be disposed of under Customs laws and regulations,
as long as that disposition does not result in its introduction into the United States.
In the event the importer can cure the defect within 8 hours, the fish would be released for importation and no penalties
would be incurred under ATCA. If, within 10 days of fish being placed into a bonded warehouse, the Regional Director
notifies the District Director of Customs that complete, approved documentation for that fish has been received,
the fish would be allowed to be entered into the United States; otherwise, it would be disposed of as allowed under Customs
laws and regulations. If, within 10 days of fish being released under bond, the Regional Director does not receive
complete, approved documentation for that fish, the importer or consignee would be notified to redeliver or cause
to be redelivered to the District Director of Customs those fish that were released under bond. In the event that any
such fish is not redelivered within 3 days following the notification, without impairment in value, liquidated damages
would be assessed in the full amount of the bond given. The importer would remain liable for any expenses incurred in
the storage and/or disposal of bluefin tuna refused admission under these regulations. In addition, if the fish is
refused entry into the United States or if the importer abandons the product, the importer would be subject to the civil
and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under ATCA.


Scenarios


The following are five examples of use of the BSD under the proposed rule in which shipments of bluefin tuna are imported
into and/or exported from the United States:


1. Exports from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements:


A BSD from a country for which the AA has not waived validation requirements would have to be validated by a responsible
government official for that country. The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (excluding
the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The exporter then would submit
the original of the BSD for validation by the designated government official. A copy would be submitted to the domestic
fisheries agency and the original BSD would accompany the shipment into the United States.
If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country)
and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD, with the
importer's entries and certification, would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy
would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export.
If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a United States
state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed
by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within
24 hours of the time of import.


2. Exports from a country for which the AA has waived validation requirements:


If the AA has waived validation requirements for a country, a BSD, except for bulk-frozen shipments, would not have
to be validated by a government official of that country. The export, exporter's certification, and description
of shipment (excluding the country-issued tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. A copy
would be submitted to the domestic fisheries agency and the original BSD would accompany the shipment into the United
States.
If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country)
and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's
entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted
to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export.
If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a United States
state and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed
by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within
24 hours of the time of import.


3. Export of U.S.-caught bluefin tuna:


Since the United States has a tagging requirement for individually exported Atlantic bluefin tuna, and this proposed
rule would implement such a tagging requirement for Pacific bluefin tuna exported from the United States, the BSD
would not have to be validated by a government official (except for bulk-frozen shipments, which would not be tagged
and would be accompanied by a validated BSD). The export, exporter certification, and description of shipment (including
the country-coded tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the exporter. The original BSD with the exporter's
entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted
to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of export.


4. Import of bulk-frozen shipments to the United States:


For a bulk-frozen import, the export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued
tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the foreign exporter. The exporter would then submit the BSD to
a responsible government official of the country of the flag vessel harvesting the tuna for validation, even if validation
requirements have been otherwise waived for that country. The exporter would then submit and/or retain copies of
the document as required by the regulations of the country, and the original document would accompany the shipment
into the United States.
If the U.S. importer re-exports the fish, the import section (naming the United States as the intermediate country)
and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the importer. The original BSD with the importer's
entries and certification would accompany the shipment to the final destination, and a completed copy would be submitted
to NMFS within 24 hours of the time of re-export.
If the U.S. importer sells the fish for consumption in the domestic market, the import section (naming a U.S. state
and city as the final point of import) and the importer's certification section of the BSD would be completed by the
importer. The original BSD with the importer's entries and certification would be submitted to NMFS within 24 hours
of the time of import.


5. Export of bulk-frozen shipments from the United States:


For a bulk-frozen export, the export, exporter's certification, and description of shipment (excluding the country-issued
tag number) sections on the BSD would be completed by the U.S. exporter. The exporter would submit the original to the
designated NMFS official for validation, then submit a copy of the completed document to NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

) within 24 hours of the time of export. The original completed document would accompany the shipment to any intermediate
countries, if applicable, and to the country of final destination.


Classification


This proposed rule is published under the authority of the ATCA, 16 U.S.C. 971 

et

 

seq

. The AA has preliminarily determined that this proposed rule is necessary to implement the recommendation of ICCAT
and is necessary for management of the bluefin tuna fisheries.
The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed
rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the
estimated annual cost to all respondents in the aggregate would be less than $56,000. Approximately 230 bluefin dealers
would be affected. This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.
This proposed rule contains new and revised collection-of-information requirements subject to review under the
Paperwork Reduction Act. It modifies and renews requirements that were approved by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under OMB control numbers 0648-0040, 0648-0204 and 0648-0239. The public reporting burden
for completing an application for a Federal permit for dealers that export or re-export Pacific bluefin tuna is estimated
at 0.08 hours (5 minutes) per response. The public reporting burden for these dealers for collection-of-information
on dealer reports is estimated at 0.20 hours (12 minutes) per response for the biweekly dealer reports and affixing
tags, and 0.33 hours (20 minutes) per response for all bluefin tuna dealers for completing a BSD. These estimates include
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any
other aspects of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to NMFS (see 

ADDRESSES

) and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0648-0040), Washington, D.C. 20503.

Administrator and the Assistant Administrator determines that the document meets the information requirements
of this section. In such case, the Assistant Administrator will publish a finding to that effect and an approval of
the document in the 

Federal Register

. Effective upon the date of publication of such finding in the 

Federal Register

, shipments of bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products offered for importation from said country may be accompanied
by either that country's approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document or by the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document
provided to the exporter by the Regional Director.


 285.203

Waiver of validation requirements.


(a) The approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document accompanying any import of bluefin tuna that is not frozen in bulk
from any country, whether or not that country is a member of ICCAT, is not required to be validated by a government official
from that country if the Assistant Administrator waives the validation requirement for that country. Such a waiver
does not apply to shipments of tuna frozen in bulk.
(b) The Assistant Administrator shall publish such finding and waiver in the 

Federal Register

 upon finding that:
(1) All fresh or individually frozen bluefin tuna available for sale from a country are tagged, or included in an ICCAT-accepted

. If a shipment containing bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products is denied entry under the provisions of  285.200,
the District Director of Customs shall refuse to release the fish for entry into the United States and shall issue a
notice of such refusal to the importer or consignee, and to NMFS Enforcement.
(b) 

Disposition of bluefin tuna not accompanied by required documentation

. (1) Bluefin tuna that is offered for importation without the required Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document must be
either:
(i) Exported under Customs supervision within 24 hours;
(ii) Released under bond as provided for in paragraph (c) of this section;
(iii) Placed in a bonded warehouse; or
(iv) Disposed of under Customs laws and regulations, as long as that disposition does not result in its introduction
into the United States.
(2) The importer remains liable for any expenses incurred in the storage and/or disposal of bluefin tuna refused admission
under these regulations. If, within 24 hours of fish being placed in a bonded warehouse, the Regional Director notifies
the District Director of Customs that approved documentation for that fish has been received, the fish will be allowed
to be entered into the United States; otherwise it will be disposed of as set out in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or paragraph
(b)(1)(iv) of this section.
(c) 

Release under bond

. (1) Bluefin tuna or bluefin tuna products not accompanied or covered by the required documentation or certification
when offered for entry may be entered into the United States if the importer or consignee gives a bond on Customs Form
7551, 7553, or 7595 for the production of the required documentation or certification. The bond shall be in the amount
required under 19 CFR 25.4(a).
(2) Within 24 hours after such Customs entry, or such additional period as the District Director of Customs may allow
for good cause shown, the importer or consignee shall deliver an original or copy, as required, of the Bluefin Tuna
Statistical Document to the Regional Director, who will notify the District Director of Customs that the fish is covered
by an approved Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document. If such notification is not delivered to the District Director
of Customs for the port of entry of such fish within 24 hours of the time of Customs entry or such additional period as
may have been allowed by the District Director of Customs for good cause shown, the importer or consignee shall, by
a specified date, redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the District Director of Customs those fish that were released
in accordance with this paragraph (c).
(3) In the event that any such fish is not redelivered without impairment in value by the date specified in paragraph
(c)(2) of this section, liquidated damages shall be assessed in the full amount of bond given on Form 7551. When the
transaction has been charged against a bond given on Form 7553 or 7595, liquidated damages shall be assessed in the
amount that would have been demanded under this paragraph (c)(3) under a bond given on Form 7551.
(4) Fish released for entry into the United States through use of the bonding procedure provided in this paragraph
(c) shall be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture provisions provided for under the Act if
the required Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document is not delivered to the Regional Director within 24 hours of the time
of Customs entry, or such additional period as may have been allowed by the District Director of Customs for good cause
shown.
(5) Fish refused entry into the United States shall also be subject to the civil and criminal penalties and the forfeiture
provisions provided for under the Act.


 285.205

Ports of entry.


The Assistant Administrator shall monitor the importation of bluefin tuna into the United States. If the Assistant
Administrator determines that the diversity of handling practices at certain ports at which bluefin tuna is being
imported into the United States allow for circumvention of the Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document requirement, he/she
may designate, after consultation with the U.S. Customs Service, those ports at which Pacific or Atlantic bluefin
tuna may be imported into the United States. The Assistant Administrator shall announce in the 

Federal Register

 the names of ports so designated. 


 285.206
