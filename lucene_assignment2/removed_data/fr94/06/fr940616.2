ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION



Programmatic Agreement for Consideration of Historic Properties in Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (Council) and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement
(OSM), are inviting written comments from the public on a proposed Programmatic Agreement (PA) among OSM, the Council,
and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO), that would set forth OSM procedures
for taking into account the effects of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on historic properties.



The Council and OSM have jointly developed the proposed PA with NCSHPO, pursuant to  800.13 of the Council's
regulations (36 CFR part 800). The PA sets forth proposed procedures for meeting the requirements of section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89-665) (NHPA or the Act) and other provisions of the
Act as amended in 1992 (Pub. L. 102-575).

The Council is an independent Federal agency that advises the President and Congress on matters of historic preservation.
OSM is the Federal agency within the Department of the Interior created by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA) to implement SMCRA's requirements concerning the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation
operations and the reclamation of abandoned mine lands. OSM's SMCRA responsibilities include conducting oversight
of State administration of approved State regulatory programs in the 24 primacy States and providing regulatory
grants to primacy States to administer and enforce their regulatory programs.

OSM initiated consultation with the Council in April 1993 to explore options for implementing its responsibilities
under the 1992 Amendments to the NHPA, particularly in relation to State permitting actions and related activities.
Over the past year, the Council, OSM, and NCSHPO have been working together to develop the proposed PA as a potential
compliance mechanism for implementing OSM's responsibilities under the 1992 NHPA Amendments and the 1991 judicial
decision in Indiana Coal Council, Inc. v. Lujan (744 F. Supp. 1385 [D.DC. 1991]). A PA is one of the options set forth
in the Council's regulations at  36 CFR section 800.13 for a Federal agency to tailor section 106 review procedures
to meet its historic preservation obligations in lieu of the standard process set forth at 36 CFR  800.4-6.
The 1992 amendments to the Act clarified that State regulatory programs administered pursuant to a delegation or
approval by a Federal agency, such as OSM's approval of State programs and delegation of surface coal mining regulation
to State Regulatory Authorities (SRAs), are Federal undertakings subject to section 106 of the Act. Therefore, OSM
is now responsible for ensuring that the effects on historic properties of each State permitting action are appropriately
considered. Each SRA must assist OSM in fulfilling its NHPA responsibilities as a standard condition of each regulatory
grant.

The proposed PA sets forth procedures for implementing OSM's NHPA section 106 responsibilities as an alternative
to the standard section 106 review process. The PA covers State permitting activities in the 24 primacy States and
on Federal lands in cooperative agreement States, where the States exercise regulatory jurisdiction over such lands.
The PA also covers OSM permitting actions in Federal program States, and on Federal lands in non-cooperative agreement
States, where OSM is the regulatory authority. The terms of the PA do not apply to OSM's regulatory activities on Indian
lands or where National Historic Landmark properties may be affected. In these situations, the standard process
at 36 CFR  800.4-6, applies. In contrast to the standard section 106 review process, the PA is intended
to expedite and streamline the process by granting more decisionmaking and implementation authority to the States.
The proposed PA provides for Council and OSM involvement in a proposed surface coal mining permitting action only
if disputes arise that are unresolvable at the State level or if a member of the public requests such involvement. The
PA also encourages SRAs and State Historic Preservation Officers to develop and formalize their own State-specific
procedures based on those contained in the PA. Finally, the PA establishes a monitoring and reporting system whereby
OSM can ensure compliance with section 106 requirements.

Publication of this proposed PA and request for comments on its scope, efficacy, and adequacy is part of the public
participation process as set forth at 36 CFR  800.13(c) of the Council's regulations with the purpose of gathering
information, comments, and suggestions on the proposed PA.




FOR COPIES OF THE PROPOSED PA CONTACT: 

Thomas M. McCulloch, Office of Education and Preservation Assistance, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation,
1100 Pennsylvania Ave. NW., suite 803, Washington, DC 20004 (202-606-8520).




COMMENTS DUE: 

Written comments on the proposed PA should be submitted to the Council, at the address given above, by 5 p.m. Eastern
time on the 15th of August, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Angeles National Forest; Proposed Pacific Pipeline Project EIS/SEIR; Notice of Intent</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the United States Forest Service, Angeles National Forest
(ANF) will direct the preparation of a joint Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Subsequent Environmental
Impact Report (SEIR) referred to as an EIS/SEIR for the Pacific Pipeline Project proposed by Pacific Pipeline System,
Inc. (PPSI). Aspen Environmental Group, a third-party contractor, under the direction of the CPUC, as the lead California
State agency, and the USFS/ANF, as the lead Federal agency will prepare a draft and final EIS/SEIR to comply with the
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).



On October 10, 1991, PPSI filed an Application with the CPUC for authorization to issue capital stock and other indebtedness
to fund development of a proposed pipeline to transport offshore Santa Barbara crude oil to Los Angeles area refineries.
At the same time, PPSI submitted a Proponent's Environmental Assessment (PEA) pursuant to the provisions of CEQA.
The CPUC conducted comprehensive scoping meetings and solicited public and agency comments on the scope of the EIR.
The CPUC selected a third party contractor (Aspen Environmental Group) to independently prepare an Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) pursuant to their responsibility as a lead agency under CEQA.

The project, as proposed at that time, was a 171-mile long, 20-inch insulated pipeline with a capacity to transport
130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. This originally proposed pipeline would have extended from Gaviota Marine
Terminal in Santa Barbara County to oil refinery destinations in the Los Angeles Basin. The pipeline would have traversed
across Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, and enter Los Angeles County near Santa Clarita. For much of its length,
the proposed pipeline would have been buried in the Southern Pacific Transportation Company railroad right-of-way
(ROW). In Los Angeles County the pipeline would have continued southeasterly, mostly parallel to Interstate 5(I-5)
to near Glendale and then south to Watts. At the Watts Junction the pipeline would have split into two pipelines, each
leading to a refinery destination. One pipeline would continue to the Chevron Refinery in El Segundo, and the other
would continue south to both Texaco's Wilmington refinery and the GATX oil distribution facility. This originally
proposed project also included five pump/pressure reduction stations along its route.

A comprehensive EIR was prepared for this originally proposed project. Five workshops and five public hearings were
conducted and significant public comments were received on the Draft EIR and incorporated into the Final document.
In addition to the comprehensive EIR, an Executive Summary was prepared and made available to the public in both English
and Spanish language versions. The Final EIR (FEIR) was Certified by the CPUC in 1993, indicating that in their view,
the EIR had adequately identified the potential impacts of the Proposed Project and contained the information required
for making their final decision on the project, which would be reached after conducting evidentiary hearings and
upon the receipt of staff recommendations. However, due to project changes announced by PPSI after certification,
evidentiary hearings were not held, nor was a decision made on the Proposed Project by the CPUC.

In December of 1993, PPSI filed an Amended Application with the CPUC. Later, in early 1994, PPSI also filed this Amended
Application with the ANF. This Amendment was based on an Agreement reached by major potential users of the Proposed
Pipeline (Santa Barbara offshore producers) and the All American Pipeline Company (AAPL). The producers agreed
that the only means of transporting their oil out of Santa Barbara County by pipeline will be through use of the existing
AAPL, which can transport all produced oil in this area to Kern County, and ultimately, to Texas, if requested by producers.
However, producers have informed agencies and the public that the preferred destination for the majority of their
heavy offshore production is the Los Angeles area refineries. Currently there are no existing pipelines with adequate
capacity to transfer crude oil from the Southern Kern County to the Los Angeles area.

Thus, PPSI proposed to modify their project to comply with recent agreements and respond to this demand.

The Amendment filed with the ANF differs from the original proposal in the following manner:






0

 The origination point of the pipeline would be at an existing Texaco oil facility in Emidio, Kern County, an
area adjacent to the All American Pipeline, which would enable the transfer of Santa Barbara offshore crude oil from
the AAPL to the Pacific Pipeline.



0

 From this origination point a proposed 20-inch pipeline segment will continue for 62 miles to Castaic Junction,
at which point, it would join the originally proposed project as applied for by PPSI. The 62-mile pipeline ROW would
be generally parallel to I-5, and will traverse through the National Forest System land administered by the
ANF. This newly proposed 62 miles from Emidio to Castaic Junction would replace the 104 miles of previously proposed
pipeline from the Gaviota Marine Terminal to the Castaic Junction.



0

 The replacement of the previously proposed Gaviota to Castaic Junction pipeline with the new 62-mile pipeline
would result in the following changes in ancillary facilities:




_five of the pump/pressure reduction stations required previously in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angles Counties
would be replaced by three new pump/pressure reduction stations in Kern and Los Angeles Counties

_the proposed Control Center for the pipeline would be located in Taylor Yard (Los Angeles) instead of Ventura County,
as originally proposed.






0

 The Amendment also requires consideration of three additional refinery/terminal destinations in Los Angeles
County (retaining the previous three destinations). These three destinations are:




_Unocal Refinery in Carson

_Chemoil Terminal in Carson

_Ultramar Refinery in Wilmington.




These newly proposed destinations would require installations of an additional 3.3 miles of 16-inch pipeline that
was not considered in the FEIR. Considering these additional connecting lines, the total length of the proposed pipeline
would be approximately 132 miles (versus 171 miles for the originally Proposed Project).



The Amended Application also refers to a future scenario in which Mobil would obtain a permit and would produce up to
40,000 bpd of oil at their Santa Barbara Clearview Project. The Applicant suggests that the previously proposed pipeline
between Ellwood to Castaic Junction might be reconsidered for this potential scenario.

The cumulative impacts associated with this uncertain scenario were identified in the original FEIR. The EIS/SEIR
will consider this potential scenario and alternatives to it in the alternatives analysis section of the document.



Project Alternatives



Possible alternatives to the project would include:







0

 No action or not constructing the pipeline.



0

 Any reasonable project that can achieve the objectives of the Proposed Action, with lower overall impacts
to the environment.



0

 Route alternatives identified as a result of project scoping.



Supplementary Information



A number of documents providing general information about the ANF have already been issued. These documents include
the ANF Land and Resources Management Plan, FEIS and Record of Decision. These documents allow, under certain conditions,
the issuance of special use permits for pipelines.

Because of the magnitude of the changes made to the project and its potential significant impacts on the environment,
an initial study was not prepared. The originally submitted and newly amended PEAs provided by PPSI in its Application,
as well as the Pacific Pipeline FEIR and Executive Summary were used to determine the need for the EIS. These documents
are available for review at the following locations:

The EIS/SEIR Process



As indicated in the project description, the newly proposed segment of the pipeline traverses the National Forest
System land administered by the ANF. Thus, the Applicant will require right-of-way authorization and special use
permits from the ANF. In order to consider issuance of these permits, and based on potential impacts identified in
the Applicant's PEA, ANF will prepare an EIS pursuant to NEPA requirements.

The Draft EIS (DEIS) is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and should be available
for public review by November of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEIS in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the DEIS will be 60 days from the date the EPA's notice appears in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of the DEIS must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC

, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived
if not raised until after completion of the Final EIS (FEIS), 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris

 490 F. Supp. 1334 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that the substantive comments and objectives are
made available to the Forest Service. This is to ensure that substantive comments and objections are made available
when the USFS can meaningfully respond to them in the FEIS. Comments on the DEIS should be specific and should address
the adequacy of the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality
Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3). It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the DEIS.

After the end of the DEIS comment period, comments will be analyzed and considered by the USFS in preparing the FEIS.
The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by April of 1995. In the FEIS the Forest Service is required to respond to the comments
received (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official (Mike Rogers, Forest Supervisor, ANF, Arcadia, CA) will consider
the comments, responses, environmental consequences discussed in the EIS, and applicable laws, regulations and
policies in making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsible official will document the decision and reasons
for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 215.



Proposed Scope of the EIS/SEIR



The EIS/SEIR will present the analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed Pacific Pipeline Project and
comparative environmental effects of the alternatives, and will identify mitigation measures for potentially
significant impacts. The EIS will address the Project from Emidio to the Ultramar refinery in Wilmington. However,
for the segment from Castaic to Texaco's Wilmington refinery the EIS will, primarily, rely on the existing FEIR. The
joint document will contain a separate section in which the conclusions stated in the FEIR will be summarized. The
potential for construction and operation of the segment of the project which was previously proposed between Santa
Barbara and Castaic Junction will be considered in the alternatives analysis section of the document.

The EIS/SEIR will address all issue areas for which potential significant impacts are anticipated. These issue areas
include:



0

 Air Quality. Construction and operation emissions and effects.



0

 Biological Resources. Effects on native habitats that support rare, threatened, or endangered species;
impacts on sensitive habitats or species downslope from the ROW as a result of sedimentation or erosion; damage to
native plant habitats due to construction; loss of habitat due to vegetation removal; and effects of noise disturbance
on nesting and foraging of wildlife species.



0

 Cultural Resources. Construction effects on prehistoric sites, structures, regional districts or other
physical evidence associated with human activity; disturbance during erosion control program excavation, illicit
artifact collection by pipeline workers and construction equipment and oil spill containment encroachment in sensitive
areas; Impacts on Native American values.



0

 Environmental Contamination. Effects of disturbance from trench excavation to contaminated sites along
the ROW on pipeline workers; migration of contaminants via surface ground water runoff; and pipeline passage through
oil fields with abandoned wells.



0

 Geology. Slope stability and seismic impacts associated with fault rupture and liquefaction/lateral spreading;
and damage to above ground structures from earthquake-induced ground shaking.

Project Scoping Process



The EIS/SEIR on the Proposed Pacific Pipeline Project will focus on significant environmental effects. The process
of determining the focus and content of the EIS/SEIR is known as scoping (40 CFR 1501.7). Scoping helps to identify
the range of actions, alternatives, environmental effects, and mitigation measures to be analyzed in depth, and
eliminates from detailed study those issues that are not pertinent to the final decision on the Proposed Project.
The USFS will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, the proponent
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in, or affected by the proposed action. Significant
issues may be identified through public and agency comments.

Scoping, however, is not conducted to resolve differences concerning the merits of the project or to anticipate the
ultimate decision on the proposal. Rather, the purpose of scoping is to help ensure that a comprehensive and focused
EIS/SEIR will be prepared that provides a firm basis for the decision-making process. The scoping process includes:



0

 Identifying potential issues.



0

 Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.



0

 Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental
analysis.



0

 Exploring additional alternatives.



0

 Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions).



0

 Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.

Public and agency scoping sessions will be held in the following areas:




Vista Del Lago Visitor Center, Vista Del Lago Exit (ten miles north of Castaic Junction), Interstate 5, June 27, 1994,
7 p.m.

Aragon Elementary School, 1118 Aragon Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90065, June 28, 1994, 7 p.m.

7 p.m.

City of San Fernando, Council Chambers, 117 McNeil Street, San Fernando, CA 91340, June 30, 1994, 7 p.m.



Agency Comments



Notice has been sent to responsible Federal Agencies, the State, and the 

Federal Register

. Also State responsible and trustee agencies and the State Clearinghouse have been notified. We need to know the views
of your agency as to the scope and content of the environmental information which reflects your agency's statutory
responsibilities in connection with the proposed project. Once again, responses should identify the issues to be
considered in the Draft EIS/SEIR, including significant environmental issues, alternatives, mitigation measures,
and whether the responding agency will be responsible State of Federal agency or a state trustee agency.

Due to the time limits mandated by State and Federal Laws, your response must be sent at the earliest possible date but
no later than 30 days after publication of this notice. Please send your response to: Richard Borden (ANF), c/o Aspen
Environmental Group, 30423 Canwood Street, suite 218, Agoura Hills, CA 91301.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On June 7, 1994, Wallowa-Whitman Forest Supervisor, R.M. Richmond, signed a Decision Notice which adopted into the
Forest Plan the Joseph Creek Wild and Scenic River Management Plan which required an amendment to the Wallowa-Whitman
Forest Plan.



This management plan outlines use levels, development levels, resource protection measures, and outlines a general
management direction for the river corridor. This amendment is necessary to implement the Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act which required the Forest Service to develop a management plan for Joseph Creek. Interim direction was identified
in the Forest Plan as Management Area 7 (Wild and Scenic Rivers). The environmental assessment documents the analysis
of alternatives to managing the Joseph Creek Wild and Scenic River in accordance with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

This decision is subject to appeal pursuant to Forest Service regulations 36 CFR part 217. Appeals must be filed within
45 days from the date of publication in the Baker City Herald. Notices of Appeals must meet the requirement of 36 CFR
217.9.

The environmental assessment for the Joseph Creek Wild and Scenic River Management Plan is available for the public
review at the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest Supervisor's Office in Baker City, Oregon.

Foreign-Trade Zone 172_Oneida County, NY; Application for Subzone 
Oneida Ltd. (Tableware) Sherrill and Oneida, NY



An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the County of Oneida, New York, grantee
of FTZ 172, requesting special-purpose subzone status for the manufacturing facilities of Oneida Ltd. in Sherrill
and Oneida, New York. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as
amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on June 7, 1994.


The Oneida facilities involve three sites in Sherrill (Oneida County) and Oneida (Madison County), New York: Site
1 (116 acres)_Main Plant, East Seneca Street and Route 5, Sherrill; Site 2 (63 acres)_Knife Plant, Kenwood Avenue,
Sherrill; and Site 3 (0.5 acres)_warehouse facility (D.J. Warehouse), Wilson Street, Oneida. The facilities (2500
employees) are used to manufacture a full line of stainless steel, silverplated and sterling silver flatware (knives,
forks and spoons) as well as certain hollowware (tea services, bowls, trays, cups). The facilities are also used to
warehouse/package/distribute porcelain, chinaware, crystal and miscellaneous giftware. Certain finished and
semi-finished items, accounting for up to 15 percent of sales, are sourced from abroad to fill out product lines. (Stainless
steel mill products are sourced domestically.) Oneida is requesting to use zone procedures only for silverplating
of foreign-sourced stainless steel tableware and for warehousing and packaging of finished products. 

Zone procedures would exempt Oneida from Customs duty payments on foreign items that are exported. On domestic sales,
the company would be able to choose the duty rates that apply to the finished silverplated products (4.5 to 6.0%). The
duty rates on foreign-sourced stainless steel tableware items used in the silverplating activity range from 6 to
17 percent. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the plant's international
competitiveness. 

In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate
the application and report to the Board. 

Public comment is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and 3 copies) shall be addressed to the
Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is August 15, 1994. Rebuttal
comments in response to material submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day
period (to Tuesday, August 30, 1994). 

A copy of the application and accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following
locations:

Class or Kind of Merchandise 


At the time of our initiation, we solicited comments from interested parties on whether all cased pencils constitute
one class or kind of merchandise. Respondents have argued that raw pencils/pencil blanks and semi-finished pencils
constitute a separate class or kind of merchandise apart from finished pencils. Based on the information provided,
we find that these products do not constitute a separate class or kind of merchandise. (See memorandum from E. Graham
to B. Stafford, April 15, 1994.) In a submission dated June 2, 1994, respondents argued that the merchandise subject
to this investigation comprises four separate classes or kinds of merchandise. While this argument was made too late
to be considered for our preliminary determination, we will address this in our final determination. 
The Asia Pencil Association argued that specialty pencils (

e.g.

, carpenter and art pencils) should constitute a separate class or kind of merchandise. However, the information
submitted in support of their claim was insufficient to allow us to make a determination that specialty pencils are
a separate class or kind of merchandise. 


Period of Investigation 


The POI is June 1, 1993, through November 30, 1993. 


Separate Rates 


China First, Guangdong, SFTC, and Shanghai Lansheng have each requested a separate rate. Guangdong's and SFTC's
business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China

 (59 FR 22585, 22586 (May 2, 1994)) (``

Silicon Carbide

'') ``ownership of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, Guangdong
and SFTC are eligible for consideration for separate rates. 
Shanghai Lansheng has reported that, for the majority of the POI, it was owned ``by all the people'' and that it was later
reorganized as a shareholding company. It has indicated that its shares are traded on the Shanghai stock exchange.
In the 

Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Certain Paper
Clips from the People's Republic of China

 (``

Paper Clips

'') (59 FR 25885, 25887, May 18, 1994) the Department stated that ``a `municipal government' owns 70 percent of [Shanghai
Lansheng's] shares.'' There is no evidence on the record that this municipality controls other exporters of cased
pencils that made sales to the United States during the POI. We will, however, evaluate this issue carefully during
verification. 
Since ownership by all the people (the situation applicable to Shanghai Lansheng during the majority of the POI) ``does
not require the application of a single rate'' and there was no central government ownership during the later part
of the POI, Shanghai Lansheng is eligible for consideration for a separate rate.

China First has reported that it is a shareholding company and has provided a list of its shareholders. According to
China First, the shareholders elect the board of directors which, in turn, appoints the general manager. Its questionnaire
response states that there are three types of shares: A shares held by Chinese legal persons, B shares held by non-Chinese
legal persons and Enterprise shares. We do not have on the record any information addressing the similarities or differences
in rights accruing to the various types of shares. 
Based on our examination of the information provided regarding the shareholder identities and the ownership structure
of China First, we have determined that we do not have enough information on the record to grant it a separate rate at
this time. Due to the proprietary nature of the information, we are not able to discuss the ownership structure of China
First in further detail in this notice; however, there is a proprietary decision memorandum regarding this issue
on the record (see Decision Memorandum of June 8, 1994). We are assigning China First the PRC country-wide rate for
purposes of this preliminary determination. 
To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes
each exporting entity under a test arising out of the 

Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China 

(56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (

``Sparklers''

) and amplified in 

Silicon Carbide. 

Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate
the absence of both 

de jure

 and 

de facto

 governmental control over export activities. 


1. Absence of De Jure Control 


Three PRC laws that have been placed on the record in this proceeding indicate that the responsibility for managing
enterprises ``owned by all of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are
the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April
13, 1988 (

``1988 Law''

); ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved
on August 23, 1992 (

``1992 Regulations''

); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (

``Export Provisions''

). 
The 

1988 Law 

and 

1992 Regulations 

shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 

1988 Law 

provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers and purchase their own goods and materials. The 

1988 Law

 also has other provisions which indicate that enterprises have management independence from the government. The


1992 Regulations 

provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production
decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell
their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII);
dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval (Article
XVII). 
The 

Export Provisions 

list those products subject to direct government control. Pencils do not appear on the 

Export Provisions 

list and are not, therefore, subject to the export constraints. 
The existence of these laws indicates Guangdong, SFTC and Shanghai Lansheng are not 

de jure 

subject to central government control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws
and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see
``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in 

Foreign Broadcast Information Service_China-93-133 

(July 14, 1993). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of 

de facto 

control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control. 


2. Absence of De Facto Control 


The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to 

de facto 

government control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a
governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements;
(3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management;
and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding
disposition of profits or financing of losses (

see Silicon Carbide

). 
Guangdong, SFTC and Shanghai Lansheng have each asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices; (2) it negotiates
contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management operates with a
high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government control over selection
of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to sell its assets and to obtain
loans. In addition, company-specific pricing during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (

i.e.,

 the prices for comparable products appear to differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding
that there is a 

de facto

 absence of governmental control of export functions. 
Consequently, Guangdong, SFTC and Shanghai Lansheng have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of
separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses
are supported by verifiable documentation. 
There is an additional issue relating to governmental control that we will consider further for purposes of our final
determination. Guangdong and SFTC have indicated that the appointments of their general managers are subject to
approval by the local Commission on Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (COFTEC) office. While the significance
of this is unclear, the evidence cited above indicates that the COFTEC offices do not control the key functions of the
enterprises. However, we will examine at verification the precise nature of the authority that the COFTEC offices
exercise over the enterprises. 


Nonmarket Economy 


The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy (NME) in past antidumping investigations. (See, 

e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's Republic of China 

(54 FR 28053 (May 31, 1994)). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our
former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes
of this investigation. 
Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 772(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base FMV on the
NME producers' factors of production, valued in a comparable market economy that is a significant producer of the
merchandise. Section 773(c)(2) of the Act alternatively provides that where available information is inadequate
for using the factors of production methodology, FMV may be based on the export prices for comparable merchandise
from market economy countries at a comparable level of economic development.

<DOCNO> FR940616-2-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-2-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In this investigation, the respondents have urged the Department to make use of the alternative methodology provided
in section 773(c)(2) of the Act. In particular, they have argued that the primary input into PRC pencils, lindenwood,
cannot be valued elsewhere. Petitioner has also questioned the Department's ability to value certain inputs using
publicly available published information (PAPI) from India, as Indian input statistics cover broader product categories.
Petitioner does not request that the Department use the alternative methodology for FMV. Instead, it suggests that
U.S. producers' costs be used to value these inputs. 
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on the methodology provided by section 773(c)(1) of
the Act to determine FMV. The sources of individual factor prices are discussed under the FMV section, below. However,
as a result of the comments made by petitioner and respondents on the relevance of factor prices in India, we will be
seeking additional data on factor values and on export prices that could also be used under the alternative methodology
provided in section 773(c)(2) of the Act for possible use in our final determination. 


Surrogate Country 


As discussed above, section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production,
to the extent possible, in one or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable
to that of the nonmarket economy country, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department
has determined that India and Pakistan are the countries most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development.
(

See

 memorandum from the Office of Policy to the file, dated March 18, 1994.) In addition, there is evidence on the record
that pencils are produced in India. 
Although India is the preferred surrogate country for purposes of valuing the factors of production used in producing
the subject merchandise, we have resorted to Pakistan and Indonesia for certain surrogate values where Indian values
were either unavailable or significantly outdated. We have obtained and relied upon PAPI wherever possible. 


Fair Value Comparisons 


To determine whether sales of pencils from the PRC to the United States by Guangdong and Shanghai Lansheng were made
at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in
the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. 
Because all of SFTC's responses were not received in time for consideration in this preliminary determination and,
therefore, we had only partial information for calculating FMV, we have based SFTC's margin on the best information
available (BIA). (

See

 ``Best Information Available'' section of this notice.)

United States Price 


We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States.

For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire and were found to be eligible for a separate
rate, we calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United
States. We made deductions for containerization, loading, port handling expenses and foreign inland freight valued
in a surrogate country. 


Foreign Market Value 


We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise
for the three exporters. The factors used to produce pencils include materials, labor, and energy. We made adjustments
to materials costs for the resale of scrap materials, where applicable. 
In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production, we selected, where possible, the
PAPI value which was: (1) An average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted
by an interested party, or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive. 
We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the
pencil factories, and between factories, where appropriate. In those cases where a respondent failed to provide
any information on transportation distances and modes, we applied, as best information available, the most expensive
distance/modes combination (

i.e., 

the longest truck rates) that was available from the surrogate information we had selected. For two modes of transportation
(man-drawn carts, inland water transport), we were unable to obtain PAPI or cable information in time for this preliminary
determination. To value these two modes of transportation, we assumed that these forms competed effectively with
an alternate form of transportation over similar distances and used the applicable rates for the alternate form.

To value the raw materials and packing materials, we used PAPI. Our sources included: Indian Import Statistics for
1989, 1991 and 1992; and Indonesian Import Statistics for 1989. 
To value wood slats, we used the Asian market price for jelutong wood in the sawn form during the POI as reported in the
Market News Service Report for Tropical Timber and Timber Products dated November 1993. To value wood logs, we used
Indian import statistics for a group of woods in rough form which included jelutong wood. The record in this proceeding
shows that jelutong wood is used in pencil production and is similar to lindenwood, the input used by the PRC producers.
For ferrules we used Indian import statistics for a basket aluminum category and for paint we used the import statistics
category identified by respondents.

To value electricity, we used PAPI from the Asian Development Bank. To value coal and natural gas, we used Indian Import
Statistics for 1992 and the Monthly Statistics of Mineral Production, Indian Bureau of Mines dated November 1992,
respectively. To value water, we used a public cable from the U.S. consulate in Pakistan which was originally provided
in the investigation of 

Sulfanilic Acid From the PRC 

because we could not locate a value for water in any Indian or Pakistani publication. 
For all material and energy prices that were for a period prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for
inflation between the time period in question and the POI using wholesale price indices published in 

International Financial Statistics (IFS)

 by the International Monetary Fund. 
To value labor amounts, we used the International Labor Office's 

1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics. 

To determine the number of hours in an Indian workday, we used the 

Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990. 

We adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using the consumer
price indices published in 

IFS. 
To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on elements of industry group income statements from
The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin

 

(RBI), 

December 1992. We based our overhead percentage calculations on the RBI data, adjusted to reflect an energy-exclusive
overhead percentage. For selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, we calculated percentages
based on the RBI data. We used the calculated SG&A percentages because they were greater than the ten percent statutory
minimum. We also used the calculated profit percentage because it was greater than the statutory minimum of eight
percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&A expenses. 
We made no adjustments for selling expenses. We added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of packing materials
to the factories producing pencils. 


Best Information Available 


Because information has not been presented to the Department to prove otherwise, any PRC companies not participating
in this investigation are not entitled to separate dumping margins. Potential exporters identified by the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) have failed to respond to our questionnaire. In the absence of
responses from these and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the PRC country-wide rate on BIA. As discussed
above, we are also applying BIA to SFTC. 
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and more adverse margins for those
respondents which did not cooperate in an investigation. As outlined in the 

Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products From
Argentina (``Argentina Steel''), 

58 FR 7066, 7069, 7070 (February 4, 1993), when a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form required,
or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign
to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any
respondent in the investigation. Here, since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning
to them the highest margin in the petition, as recalculated by the Department for the initiation and for this determination
using petitioner's updated information submitted May 1994. This rate applies to all exporters other than those responding
exporters which have shown their independence from central government control. 
Since SFTC has been cooperative in this proceeding, and since we have preliminarily determined it is eligible for
a separate rate, we are assigning a margin based on the highest calculated rate for any respondent in the investigation
(see 

Argentina Steel

). 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify all information determined to be acceptable for use in making
our final determination. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of pencils from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date
of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
exceeds the USP as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further
notice. 
The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows: 








ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than August 8, 1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than August
12, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties
an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be held at
10 a.m. on August 15, 1994, at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW.,
Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before
the scheduled time. 
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing, or to participate if one is requested, must submit a written request
to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten
days of the publication of this notice. Requests should contain: (1) The party's name, address, and telephone number;
(2) the number of participants; and (3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral
presentations will be limited to issues raised in the briefs. If this investigation proceeds normally, we will make
our final determination by August 22, 1994. 
This determination is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minority Business Development Agency, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from November 1, 1994 to October 31, 1995, is estimated at $333,125. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the San Jose, California Geographic Service Area.



The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.

The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Anticipated processing time of this award is 120 days. Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal

Assistance to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the Secretary, DoD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of a program for providing financial assistance to LEAs.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 386 of Public Law No. 102-484, as amended by section 373 of Public Law 103-160, the ``National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994,'' November 30, 1993, notice is hereby given of a program to provide
financial assistance to eligible LEAs. Section 386(b) of Public Law No. 102-484, as amended, requires DoD to
assist an LEA that cannot, without such aid, ``provide [its]students . . . with a level of education
that is equivalent to the minimum level of education available in schools of the other local educational agencies
of the same State,'' provided that the LEA meets one of the three criteria established by section 386(c). For the purpose
of this notice, the term ``military dependent student'' has the same meaning as in section 386(h)(2) of Public Law
102-484, as amended. In making the necessary determination under section 386(b), the Secretary of Defense
must consult the Secretary of Education.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

During fiscal year (FY) 1994, the Department of Defense shall provide 40 million dollars to assist LEAs that meet criteria
in section 386 of Public Law 102-484, as amended. (For the purposes of this program, DoD shall rely on data from
the Department of Education).


Pursuant to subsection 386(c)(1) of Public Law No. 102-484, as amended, an LEA is eligible for assistance under
this program if it satisfies subsection 386(b) and ``at least 30 percent (as rounded to the nearest whole percent)
of the students in average daily attendance in the schools of that agency in that fiscal year are military dependent
students counted under subsection (a) or (b) of section 3 of the Act of September 30, 1950 (Pub. L. 874, Eighty-first
Congress; 20 U.S.C. 238).''
Pursuant to subsection 386(c)(2) of Public Law No. 102-484, as amended, an LEA is eligible for assistance under
this program if it satisfies subsection 386(b) and its average daily attendance (ADA) of military dependent students
increased by at least 300 or more students from FY 1993 to FY 1994 as a result of ``a relocation of Armed Forces personnel
or civilian employees of the Department of Defense or as a result of a realignment of one or more military installations.''
Such 300 or more students must equal an increase in the ADA of military dependent students of at least 10 percent or more
from FY 1993 to FY 1994.
An alternate way of achieving eligibility for assistance is prescribed under subsection 386(c)(3) of Public Law
No. 102-484, as amended. To qualify, the LEA must satisfy subsection 386(b) and ``by reason of consolidation
or reorganization of local educational agencies be a successor of [an LEA] that for fiscal year 1992,'' was eligible
to receive payments under DoD Instruction 1342.18, dated June 3, 1991 (32 CFR part 240, 56 FR 28821), and satisfy the
requirements in subsection 386(a)(1) or subsection 386(c)(2).
For the purposes of this program, the following definitions are applicable:
(a) Applicant. Any LEA requesting assistance under this notice.
(b) Current Expenditures. ``[E]xpenditures for free public education, including expenditures for administration,
instruction, attendance and health services, pupil transportation services, operation and maintenance of plant,
fixed charges, and expenditures to cover deficits for food services and student body activities. The term does not
include expenditures for community services, capital outlay, debt service, or any expenditures made from funds
granted for the purpose of chapter 1 and 2 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.
2701-2976). An expenditure for the replacement of equipment is considered to be either a current expenditure
or capital outlay, whichever is in accordance with State accounting guidelines, law, or practice.'' 34 CFR  222.3.
(c) DoD Contribution. The amount of financial assistance an applicant shall receive under this notice.
(d) Federal Property. Real property that because of Federal law, agreement, or policy is exempt from taxation by a
State or political subdivision of a State and that the United States owns in fee simple or leases from another party.
(e) Local Education Agency (LEA). A public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within
a State for either administrative control or direction of, or to perform a service function for, public elementary
or secondary schools in a city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State, or such
combination of school districts or counties as are recognized in a State as an administrative agency for its public
elementary or secondary schools. Such term includes any other public institution or agency having administrative
control and direction of a public elementary or secondary school.
(f) Military Dependent Student. A student that is a dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces or a dependent child
of a civilian employee of the Department of Defense.
(g) Military Personnel. Members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty.
(h) Military 3(a) Student. A child who attends the school(s) of a LEA that provides free public education and who, while
attending such school(s) of the LEA, resides on Federal property and has a parent who is on active duty in the Armed Forces
(as defined in section 101(4) of 10 U.S.C.).
(i) Military 3(b) Student. A child who attends the schools of a LEA that provides a free public education and who, while
attending such school(s), has a parent who is on active duty in the Armed Forces (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(4)) but
such child does not reside on Federal property.

(j) Parent. The biological father or mother of a child; a person who, by order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
has been declared the father or mother of a child by adoption; the legal guardian of a child; or a person in whose household
a child resides, provided that such person stands in loco parentis to that child and contributes at least one-half
of the child's support. 

(k) Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE). The average current expenditure for an individual student. 

The Department of Defense shall provide 40 million dollars to assist the LEAs that satisfy the requirements of this
notice This money shall be used only to supplement funding for the eligible LEAs operating schools that provide free
public education to military dependent students for whom: (1) For the prior and current FYs, the LEA has applied for
and received, or shall receive, financial assistance from all regular Federal and State educational aid programs
available to it, including the Impact Aid Program (Pub. L. No. 81-874, section 3, as amended); (2) the eligibility
of the LEA under State law for State aid for free public education and the amount of that aid are no different than the
eligibility and amounts received by LEAs in that State without military dependent students; and (3) the LEA files
with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) a letter of application (see Sample
Letter at the end of this notice) and a copy of an independently audited financial report of the applicant LEA for the
second preceding FY.

The eligible LEAs under this notice insofar as it implements subsection 386(c)(1) and subsection 386(c)(2) shall

Riverside Gas Storage Co.; Intent To Prepare an Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Riverside Gas Storage
Field Project and Request for Comments on Environmental Issues 


June 10, 1994. 


The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or the Commission) will prepare an environmental assessment
(EA) that will discuss environmental impacts of the construction and operation of facilities proposed in the Riverside
Gas Storage Field Project.
 This EA will be used by the Commission in its decision-making process to determine whether an environmental impact
statement is necessary and whether or not to approve the project. 





Summary of the Proposed Project 



Riverside Gas Storage Company (Riverside) wants Commission authorization to construct and operate a new underground
natural gas storage field in Greene and Fayette Counties, Pennsylvania. Riverside proposes to convert a nearly depleted
gas field to gas storage use. The proposed storage facility would have 5.1 billion cubic feet (BCF) of storage capacity
(3.1 BCF working gas capacity). To develop the Riverside Gas Storage Field, Riverside would: 
 Recomplete 21 existing wells as injection/withdrawal wells; 
 Recomplete one existing well as an observation well; 
 Plug and abandon 9 existing gas wells (all remaining wells in field); 
 Construct 3.42 miles of 12-inch-diameter gathering pipeline; 
 Construct 2.44 miles of 6-inch-diameter pipeline (22 segments of various lengths to attach wells to the gathering
pipeline); 
 Construct a new 3,150-horsepower compressor station; and 

 Construct ancillary facilities at the compressor station including meters, dehydrator trains, storage
tanks for oil and glycol, access roads, and water and electric utilities. 
The general location of these facilities is shown in appendix 1.
 





Land Requirements for Construction 


Riverside would use 101.3 acres of land for the Riverside Gas Storage Field Project. Of this total, 10 acres would be
used for the compressor station, 43.4 acres would be associated with well pads (1.4 acres per well) and 47.9 acres would
be associated with the right-of-way for the storage pipelines. 
Following completion of construction, approximately 12.6 acres associated with the nine plugged and abandoned
wells would be allowed to revert to the land use desired by the property owner. 
Riverside proposes to use a an 85-foot-wide construction right-of-way for its 12-inch-diameter pipeline and a 50-foot-wide
construction right-of-way for its 6-inch-diameter pipeline. Riverside proposes to use an 85 to 100-foot-wide right-of-way
for construction across streams. 


The EA Process 


The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. 


The EA will discuss impacts that 

could

 occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under these general headings: 
 Geology and soils;
 Water resources;
 Vegetation and wildlife;
 Pipeline safety;
 Land use;
 Cultural resources;
 Air quality and noise.

We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 
Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project. 


Currently Identified Environmental Issues 


We have already identified several environmental issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review
of the proposed facilities and the information provided by Riverside. Keep in mind that this is a preliminary list.
The list of issues will be added to, subtracted from, or changed based on your comments and our analysis. 
The list of environmental issues: 
 Riverside would recomplete 22 existing wells in Greene and Fayette Counties, Pennsylvania: one observation
well and 21 injection/withdrawal wells. These wells and drilling operations have potential groundwater impacts.

 Riverside may affect up to five wetlands in the project area while constructing its pipelines. 
 There may be noise concerns at residences surrounding Riverside's new compressor station. 
 There may be federally listed threatened or endangered species in the project area.

 The Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Officer indicated there is potential cultural resources sites
in the project area and requested a survey. 
 Existing and future coal mining operations and the Riverside Gas Storage Field Project may affect each other.



Public Participation 


You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. 
Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: 
 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St. NE., Washington, DC 20426; 
 Reference Docket No. CP94-292-000; 
 Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol St. NE., room 7312, Washington, DC 20426; and
 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, DC on or before July 11, 1994. 
If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Grape at the above address. 


Becoming an Intervenor 


In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 
The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by Section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 


Additional Questions? 


Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, at (202)

consistent with the Settlement Agreement with ODEC in Docket No. ER93-96-000, the non-fuel revenues
under the Partial Requirements rate schedule are no greater than the non-fuel revenues under the superseded Full
Requirements rate schedules.

Delmarva requests that the Partial Requirements rates become effective on July 15, 1994 and suspended until January
1, 1995, when ODEC is scheduled to begin purchasing power and energy from PSE&G.

Delmarva states that a copy of the filing has been posted as required by the Commission's regulations, and a copy has
been mailed to each of the customers affected by the proposed changes and to the Public Service Commissions of the States
of Delaware and Maryland and the Virginia State Corporation Commission.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or
protests should be filed on or before June 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the
appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing
to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available
for public inspection.

Gas Research Institute; Annual Application 



June 10, 1994. 



Take notice that on June 8, 1994, Gas Research Institute (GRI) filed an application requesting advance approval of
its 1995-1999 Five-Year Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) Plan, 1995-1996 RD&D
Program, and the funding of its R&D activities for 1995, pursuant to the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Regulations,
particularly 18 CFR 154.38(d)(5). 

In its application, GRI proposes to increase its contract obligations to $210.4 million in 1995, an increase of 4.3%
over the authorized 1994 obligations budget. GRI seeks to collect $191,688,000 through jurisdictional rates and
charges during the twelve months ending December 31, 1995. This $191.7 million, plus additional funds collected
on intrastate transactions, will provide the necessary cash to fund the 1995 RD&D program. 

GRI proposes to fund the first year of the 1995-1996 R&D program through the following surcharges: (1) A
demand/reservation surcharge on two-part rates of 21.8 cents/Dth-mo. for ``high load factor customers''; (2) a
demand/reservation surcharge on two-part rates of 13.4 cents/Dth-mo. for ``low load factor customers''; (3) a volumetric
commodity/usage surcharge of 0.85 cents for firm services involving two-part rates, and for one-part interruptible
rates; (4) a special ``small customer'' surcharge of 2.0 cents/Dth; and (5) a surcharge of 1.57 cents/Dth-mo. for
one-part, firm service outside the ``small customer'' class. GRI asserts that these surcharges comply with the Commission's
March 22, 1993 ``Order on Contested Settlement'' approving, without modification, the ``Stipulation and Agreement
concerning Post-1993 GRI Funding Mechanism''. 

The Commission Staff will analyze GRI's application and prepare a Commission Staff Report. This Staff Report will
be served on all parties and filed with the Commission as a public document by July 28, 1994. Comments on the Staff Report
and GRI's application by all parties, except GRI, must be filed with the Commission on or before August 12, 1994. GRI's
reply comments must be filed on or before August 26, 1994. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest GRI's application, except for GRI members and state regulatory commissions,
who are automatically permitted to participate in the instant proceedings as intervenors, should file a motion to
intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington,
DC 20426, in accordance with the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed
on or before June 24, 1994. All comments and protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to this proceeding. Any person wishing to become
a party, other than a GRI member or a state regulatory commission, must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of a Final List of Water Quality Limited Waterbodies in the State of Minnesota</DOCTITLE>
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a final Clean Water Act section 303(d) list 
for the State of Minnesota. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this notice is to announce the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) final decision
with respect to the list required of the State of Minnesota, under section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). On December
8, 1993, the USEPA published (58 FR 64584) a proposed list of waterbodies, subsequent to its disapproval, on August
9, 1993, of portions of the list prepared by the State of Minnesota. A total of 72 waterbodies have been identified as
appropriate waterbodies for the development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs), pursuant to section 303(d), 40
CFR part 130, and USEPA guidance, as resources permit. An additional number of waterbodies have been identified,
for which implementation of a TMDL will be dependent on a variety of events or actions outside the control of the State
of Minnesota. Copies of the lists may be obtained at the address provided in the addresses section.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 303(d) of the CWA requires that the States identify lists of waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate.
Further, section 303(d) requires that the lists developed by the States be submitted to the USEPA for review and approval
or disapproval. To the extent that the USEPA disapproves a State submittal, section 303(d) of the CWA requires that
the USEPA develop and publish the list. The USEPA must also assure that public participation in the formulation of
a list of waterbodies is consistent with 40 CFR part 25, and may publicly notice a State submittal for that purpose as
well. 



The State of Minnesota had prepared several lists for the USEPA review, and had submitted and subsequently withdrawn
several of these. On July 6, 1993, the USEPA received from Minnesota, a proposed list, which contained some, but not
all of the waterbodies which the USEPA believed should be included on the list applicable to the State of Minnesota.
As a result, the USEPA issued, on August 9, 1993, a partial approval of the list submitted by the State, approving the
list to the extent that it did include waterbodies which were appropriately included on the list, but disapproving
the submission in that it did not include all waterbodies which would be subject to the requirements of section 303(d).


Subsequently, USEPA developed a list of additional waterbodies which it believed were subject to the requirements
of section 303(d), and published a notice to that effect on December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64584). The USEPA received written
comments from four commenters, including the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). These comments are available
for public inspection at the address listed above. 



(A) Responses to Comments 



In making its final determination, the USEPA has carefully considered all comments received, and has revised its
lists accordingly. In particular, changes have been made based upon the following. 

(1) The MPCA commented that 23 stream segments were not identified on the proposed list, and should be included. 

In alternate years, the State of Minnesota, pursuant to section 305(b) of the CWA, provides a report to Congress, on
the health of waters within the State. In its 1992 report, Minnesota had identified the 23 stream segments in question,
as impaired, however, the USEPA had not included these segments on its proposed list, believing the data to be old and
somewhat unreliable. Upon further review, however, it is apparent that these segments are contiguous with other
waterbodies included upon the USEPA's proposed list, and that these other waterbodies are scheduled for TMDL development
within the next few years. As MPCA intends to develop these TMDLs for the whole waterbody, the MPCA believes that the
23 segments the USEPA had originally proposed to exclude should also be listed. The USEPA agrees. 

(2) The MPCA commented that 65 segments that were identified by the USEPA in the proposed list should not be included
because the data used to support listing does not reflect current conditions. 

The information provided by the commenter indicates that of the 65 segments, remedial actions have been taken on 51
segments. In addition, exceedences of water quality standards were infrequent for five of the 65 segments, and did
not support a conclusion that the waterbodies were impaired. Finally, the impairment determination for nine segments
was based on data that were typically five to 10 years of age, and was not thought to be indicative of current conditions.
The USEPA agrees that these waterbodies should not be listed pursuant to section 303(d). 

(3) The MPCA commented that nine waterbodies that were identified in the proposed list should not be listed because
the stated impairment is due to ubiquitous metals, for which there is no evidence, based upon biological sampling,
that designated uses are impaired. 

For each of these waterbodies, the MPCA provided documentation that the impairments described were based upon one
or more of the following: Rare excursions of the water quality standards; ambient levels of the various constituents
higher than expected for the ecoregion, but no water quality standards exceedences measured; or misinterpretation
by the USEPA of the data provided in the 305(b) report. The USEPA agrees with the MPCA that cause does not exist for listing
these waterbodies. 

(4) The MPCA commented that approximately 245 segments of waterbodies which were included on the proposed USEPA list,
should be excluded for a variety of reasons.

<TEXT>
 

All of the identified segments are segments which were listed because of the presence of a fish consumption advisory
for mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The MPCA commented that the sole, or primary source of mercury or
PCBs to these waterbodies is airborne deposition, and that where control of these sources is outside the State, the
State is unable to develop a TMDL. These segments, therefore, are not appropriate candidates for TMDL development
at this time. The USEPA agrees that technology based standards imposed under the Clean Air Act which affect sources
external to the State of Minnesota may obviate the future need for TMDL development in these waterbodies. A separate
list of these waterbody segments can be obtained by contacting the USEPA at the address provided above. 

It is important to note that not all waterbodies for which fish consumption advisories exist fall into the category
discussed above. There are certain waterbodies with fish consumption advisories, and for which TMDLs have been,
or can be successfully developed at this time. These are not included in the 245 waterbodies on which the MPCA provided
comments. 

(5) Two other commenters believed that the proposed list is inadequate because it fails to identify all water quality
limited segments within the State of Minnesota. Where the State has failed to do so, one of the commenters stated there
is a mandatory duty to identify all water quality-limited segments, and include them on the list of waterbodies for
which TMDL development is appropriate. 

The USEPA interprets section 303(d) to require the identification of water quality-limited waterbodies for which
TMDLs are appropriate. Such identification is to be based on existing and readily available data (40 CFR 130.7(b)(5));
consequently, there are no requirements within the Statute for additional monitoring or analysis. Since 40 CFR 130.7(d)(1)
requires the biennial submission of revised section 303(d) lists to the USEPA for approval, this provision recognizes,
that information will become available in the future, which can be used to revise and update the decisions made under
section 303(d). This provision supports the USEPA's position that current listings should be based on currently
available information. The submission every 2 years of a section 303(d) list addresses this issue by allowing changes
to the lists to reflect additional identification of impaired waterbodies, and allows for removal of waterbodies
once standards are attained or TMDLs developed. 

Pursuant to section 305(b) of the CWA, States must prepare, on a biennial basis, a report to Congress which assesses
the status of State waters. 40 CFR 130.7(b)(5) explicitly states that the section 305(b) report should be considered
when developing the section 303(d) list. In preparation of the December 8, 1993, proposed list, Minnesota's 1992
305(b) report was extensively used. All waterbodies listed as impaired in Appendix 1 of that report were considered
for listing. For reasons provided in the December 8, 1992, FR notice, specific comments received in response to that
notice, and elsewhere in this notice some waterbodies that were listed as impaired in the Fiscal Year 1992 section
305(b) report were not included in today's list. 

(6) One commenter stated that even if the only available data are older than five years, if those data indicate water
quality impairments, then the subject waterbodies should be listed on the section 303(d) list. 

Throughout its regulations and guidance the USEPA has consistently stated that all information should be used to
develop a section 303(d) list. In using available information, however, it is imperative to consider its accuracy
in order to assure that technically defensible determinations can be developed. The USEPA believes that data that
are older than five years, or impairment assessments based on a subjective analysis, carry a large degree of uncertainty
as to whether the impairment is still valid. As such information of this kind must be considered in light of all available
information and cannot represent a prima facie basis for listing.

(7) One commenter stated that the USEPA must actively solicit all interested parties for information on which to develop
a section 303(d) list. 

Regulations governing the solicitation of public comment may be found at 40 CFR part 25. The USEPA believes that the
publication of the proposed list in the December 8, 1993, FR notice fulfilled those requirements, and served as adequate
solicitation of comment of all interested parties. In response to that publication the USEPA received four comment
letters, one by a State agency and three by public interest groups. These comments have been thoroughly considered
in the development of the final list. 

(8) One commenter stated that the proposed list does not meet the requirements of section 303(d) because it does not
contain specific, calculated TMDLs for each waterbody listed. 

Section 303(d)(1)(A) requires the development of a list of waterbodies for which technology-based effluent limits
are not stringent enough to achieve water quality standards. Section 303(d)(1)(C) requires the development of TMDLs
for the waters listed pursuant to section 303(d)(1)(A). The USEPA has interpreted the Act to require the development
of the section 303(d) list prior to actually establishing TMDLs. The USEPA believes that to delay listing until the
TMDLs are all completed would either lead to deceptively short lists of waterbodies, or would delay the process indefinitely.
Because TMDL development can be a complex activity, involving many years of effort particularly in cases where specific
stream conditions must be analyzed, or model development and calibration must be achieved, only a few TMDLs can be
developed at any particular time. Even so, it is also recognized that remedial actions can take place before a TMDL
is developed, therefore the Agency believes that the listing process should go forward as the initial step in order
to encourage action even though actual TMDL development may take place later. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude
that development of individual TMDLs must follow list development. 

(9) One commenter stated that the proposed list does not contain any schedule for TMDL development for the next two
years, and that the criteria by which the USEPA prioritized waters on the proposed list should focus on the protection
human health. 

The December 8, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice announced as being available for public review and comment a proposed section 303(d) list for Minnesota consisting
of 447 water quality-limited segments. The notice further provided that the priority for TMDL development reflects
that contained in the September 16, 1993, section 303(d) list submitted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
In that submittal, the TMDLs identified for development through April 1994 were the Minnesota River and the Redwood
River. These waterbodies continue to be listed as high priority for TMDL development. Because the prioritization
of TMDLs as well as the resources and personnel to develop them are largely under the control of the State, the USEPA
believes it is appropriate to defer to this State prioritization. It should be noted that these priorities are subject
to annual review by the USEPA and the State in the annual program planning process under 40 CFR part 130 and as a result
of the biennial updates of the 305(b) lists required under 40 CFR part 131 and section 305(b) of the CWA. 

(10) One commenter stated that the Mississippi River from the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area downstream
to the Iowa border should be listed as high priority. 

The USEPA agrees that this waterbody is an important resource. In compliance with requirements of an National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit issued to the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission (MWCC), studies of phosphorus,
the identified pollutant of concern, are being conducted by both the MWCC and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency
on the waterbody to define better the sources of the impairments and to ascertain needed remedial actions. Current
information suggests that much of the loading of phosphorus is originating in the Minnesota River basin, which is
high priority for TMDL development. It is anticipated that remedial actions in the Minnesota River basin will have
significant positive impact on magnitude of impairments in the Mississippi River. It is anticipated that upon the
completion of the studies and implementation of additional controls required through the NPDES permit and the results
of the TMDL being developed for the Minnesota River, downstream impacts on the Mississippi River will be reduced such
that this portion of the River does not meet the requirements for listing under section 303(d). Therefore, this waterbody
continues to be listed as low priority on the section 303(d) list. 

(11) One commenter questioned why only two waterbodies were listed on the section 303(d) list. 

In the December 8, 1993, FR notice, USEPA proposed a list of 447 waterbody segments. This was in addition to the two waterbodies
which the State of Minnesota has identified as appropriate for TMDL development. While the USEPA agrees with the State
of Minnesota, that those two waterbodies warrant listing pursuant to 303(d), the USEPA also believes, that additional
waterbodies should be listed, and for that reason has proceeded with today's notice. 

(12) One commenter recommended that the following waterbodies be listed on the section 303(d) list as high priority
for TMDL development.

_All Minnesota Outstanding Resource Value Waters 
_All Minnesota designated trout streams and trout lakes 
_All Minnesota designated canoe trails 
_All Federal or Minnesota designated wild, scenic, and recreational rivers 
_All waterbodies within any National Wildlife Refuge 
_The entire length of the Mississippi River (presumed to include sections both upstream and downstream of the Minneapolis/St.
Paul metropolitan area 
_Lake Superior

 

As stated above, the resources and personnel necessary to develop TMDLs are largely under the control of the State.
In addition, the State's proximity to its public allows it to evaluate priorities in light of the public need more readily
than USEPA. Consequently the USEPA believes it is appropriate to defer to the State in the matter of prioritization
of waterbodies for TMDL development. 


(B) Revisions to the Proposed Notice 


As a result of the public comments received and continuing review of the proposed notice by the USEPA, the following
changes have been made to the final identification of the section 303(d) water quality-limited segments for the State
of Minnesota: 
(1) The final list of waterbodies for which TMDL development would be appropriate has been revised to include the 23
additional steam segments which the State has requested be included on the list, due to proximity to, and influence
upon, other waterbodies for which TMDLs are being developed. 
(2) Waterbodies for which fish consumption advisories exist, and for which remedial measures lie outside the control
of the State of Minnesota have been separately identified. 
(3) The final list of waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate excludes 65 stream segments included
in the proposed list, for which the State has provided documentation that the information leading to the USEPA's decision
to include these segments on the proposed list was not based on the most current information, and the more current information
reveals that TMDLs are no longer appropriate. 
(4) The final list excludes nine stream segments identified in the State's comments which were described as meeting
the designated uses, since the exceedences of numeric water quality criteria noted by the USEPA as the basis for our
proposal to include these segments on the 303(d) list were due to naturally occurring background concentrations.



(C) Final Notice 


This notice is being issued pursuant to section 303(d)(2) of the CWA. Under this section, the USEPA is required to publish
an identification of water quality-limited segments if a state submission is disapproved. The disapproval of the
Minnesota submission occurred on August 9, 1993. 
This notice identifies 72 water quality limited waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate and further
identifies three waterbodies for which TMDL development is scheduled to be initiated over the next two years. This
notice further identifies 245 waterbodies for which TMDL development is not feasible at this time. This constitutes
USEPA's final determination.

Improving Performance in Physicians' Office Laboratories 


Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement to improve the quality of laboratory testing in physicians' office laboratories (POLs).
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Clinical Preventive Services. (For ordering a copy of
``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``

Where to Obtain Additional Information

.'') 


Authority 


This program is authorized under section 317(k)(2)(D) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)(D)],
as amended. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are limited to non-profit professional clinical or laboratory organizations whose focus is
to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs. Applicants must be able to demonstrate that: 
1. They are laboratory medicine oriented; 
2. A goal of their organization is to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs; 
3. They have a long-standing interest in improving the performance of laboratory testing; and 
4. They have a strong, specific interest in providing professional information to private practitioners with laboratories,
thereby striving to improve the quality of laboratory testing in POLs. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $100,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund one cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will
begin on or about September 1, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to three
years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period may be
made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 




Purpose 


The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to develop and provide professional and technical information and education
to private practitioners with POLs, thereby helping improve the quality of laboratory testing available to the American
public. 


Program Requirements 


In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipient will be responsible for those activities
listed under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for those activities under B. (CDC Activities).



A. Recipient Activities 


1. Nationally, provide to POL physicians training that has been designed to improve laboratory performance. In the

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to prepare an environmental impact statement; Cyprus Bagdad Copper Mine, Bagdad, Arizona.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement for the construction
of a tailings facility expansion and south waste rock disposal facility for the existing open pit copper mine at Cyprus
Bagdad. The mine is located near the Town of Bagdad, in Yavapai County, Arizona. Cyprus Bagdad Copper Corporation
has submitted a proposed Mine Plan of Operations to the Bureau of Land Management, as required under the Code of Federal
Regulations and title V of the Federal Land and Policy Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976. The Bureau of Land Management
has responsibility for analysis, review, and approval of the mining plan. Preparation of the Environmental Impact
Statement will follow the Code of Federal Regulations, title 40, subpart 1500.


The mine plan proposes the expansion of the existing Mammoth tailings impoundment, the development of the Upper Mammoth
tailings impoundment, and the expansion of the south waste rock disposal facility to continue mineral and mining
operations at Cyprus Bagdad. The public is invited to participate in the NEPA process beginning with scoping and the
identification of issues in July 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Cyprus Bagdad Copper Mine is located near the Town of Bagdad, about 60 miles northwest of Wickenburg on State Highway
96. The existing mine is an open pit copper mine with flotation mill tailings, low grade dump leaching, and a solvent
extraction-electro winning plant.



Two tailings facilities currently contain mill wastes. The current tailings facilities are nearing capacity and
will need to be closed and expanded in two years.
The expansion of the Mammoth tailings would disturb approximately 410 additional acres. The Upper Mammoth tailings
impoundment would disturb approximately 1,440 acres. The south waste rock disposal area would be located in Bevering
Gulch and its tributaries, and the south fork of Mineral Creek, and disturb approximately 660 acres. Planned activities
would take place on a combination of lands including public and private surface and mineral lands. The proposed action
involves a total of approximately 305 acres of federal surface overlying federal minerals lands, and 705 acres of
state surface overlying federal minerals lands.
Potential issues include surface and groundwater quality, air quality, cultural resources, biological resources,
visual resources, and mine reclamation.
The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be developed by a third party contractor who has been approved by the
Bureau of Land Management. The contractor will use an interdisciplinary team to develop the document. The Bureau
of Land Management will have the responsibility for the review of the EIS.
Complete records of all phases of the environmental documentation process will be available for public review at
the Bureau of Land Management, Phoenix District Office, 2015 W. Deer Valley Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85027, and at the
Bureau of Land Management, Kingman Resource Area, 2475 Beverly Ave., Kingman, Arizona 86401.

<DOCTITLE>Rand Mountains_Fremont Valley Management Plan and Environmental Assessment in the California Desert District_Ridgecrest
Resource Area Kern County, CA</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the final approval, availability and implementation of the Rand Mountains_Fremont Valley Management
Plan in eastern Kern County, California.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Rand Mountains_Fremont Valley Management Plan has been approved by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). This
plan covers a 65,020 acre area in eastern Kern County which is important habitat for the federally listed threatened
desert tortoise. This plan was necessitated by the requirements of the Endangered Species Act (EPA) to protect a threatened
species in an area subject to conflicting uses.



The plan has 88 major management decisions which put restrictions on all uses in the area for the purpose of protecting
the native desert tortoise population, its habitat and the area's ecosystem. These plan use restrictions include
restricting off-highway vehicle (OHV) use to a maximum of 129 miles of designated vehicular routes, restricting
overnight camping to designated campsites, prohibiting all competitive OHV events and restricting use of firearms
except for the lawful taking of upland game birds within an area identified for such use. The existing West Rand ACEC
area will be expanded by 13,120 acres and changed from a Moderate to a Limited Multiple-Use Class under the California
Desert Plan. A total of 32,590 acres of the plan area will be withdrawn from mineral entry. The plan designates 44,800
acres as category 1 desert tortoise habitat. USFWS consultations will be required pursuant to section 7 of the ESA
when processing any new project proposals allowed under the plan which could impact the desert tortoise.


This plan covers all public lands in the Rand Mountains-Fremont Valley Management Area which is generally bounded
by the community of Randsburg, CA and U.S. Highway 395 on the east, the Garlock and Randsburg-Red Rock Roads on the north,
the western edge of Koehn Dry Lake and the Desert Tortoise Natural Area on the west, and private lands encompassed by
the incorporated city limites of California City, CA on the south.




ORDER: 

Notice is hereby given that effective July 18, 1994, the following use restrictions will be in effect on public lands
in the Rand Mountains-Fremont Valley Management Area.




1. No person may use, drive or otherwise operate a motorized vehicle except on those designated routes of travel that
are identified by open route signs.

2. No person may discharge a firearm at any time except shotguns and then only from September 1 through January 31st
for the lawful taking of upland game birds in the upland and mountains portion of the area as identified in the plan.


3. Camping is prohibited except in the eastern portion of the management area at sites identified in the plan.

Exemptions to this order include any otherwise authorized activity or as approved by the California Desert District
Manager or the Ridgecrest Area Manager. Maps identifying the plan area, plan use restrictions, and the network of
designated vehicular routes of travel are available from the Ridgecrest Resource Area office.

Authority for these plan restrictions is found in 43 CFR 8364.1. Violation of these restrictions is punishable by
a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or 12 months in jail.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of this plan and use restrictions is to provide increased protection for the desert tortoise populations
and its habitat in an important part of its range. The desert tortoise was listed as a threatened species under the ESA
in 1989 and is afforded increased protection under terms of the Act and this plan. During the interim while this plan
was developed, the Bureau initiated a 14 month temporary closure for the plan area and then reopened the area on November
22, 1990 to restricted use pending approval of the final plan. Since November 22, 1990, Bureau personnel along with
a large group of California Off-Road Vehicle Association volunteers have worked to implement the plan decisions
on an interim basis as approved through a consultation with the USFWS and January 23, 1991 

Federal Register 

notice. This interim FR notice will expire upon publication of this FR notice.



A formal section 7 consultation on this plan was conducted with the USFWS and a non-jeopardy biological opinion was
issued on March 10, 1993. This opinion provided additional terms and Conditions which were incorporated into the
plan. The opinion determined that this plan would result in management actions that would greatly reduce the existing
magnitude of adverse impacts to the desert tortoise and its habitat.

A 10 member volunteer Technical Review Team (TRT) was instrumental in the development of this plan. Team members represented
all primary interest groups, the CDFG and California City. They met regularly for three years to evaluate available
data and made management recommendations for the plan. The TRT is continuing to assist in reviewing procedures for
implementing the plan decisions and evaluating the plan effectiveness in protecting the plan areas desert tortoise
populations.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Consent Decree in Action Brought Under the Clean Air Act</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 CFR  50.7, notice is hereby given that a consent decree in 

United States

 v. 

Lafarge, et al., 

Civil Action No. 4-94CV-356Y, was lodged with the United States District Court for the Northern District

Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for asbestos (``the asbestos NESHAP'') during the 1989 demolition
of a mill building at Lafarge's Fort Worth cement manufacturing and distribution facility. As part of the settlement
in this case, defendant Lafarge will pay the United States a civil penalty of $10,000 and will conduct future demolition
and renovation operations in compliance with the inspection, notification, and work practice requirements of the
asbestos NESHAP.

The Department of Justice will accept written comments relating to this proposed Consent Decree for thirty (30) days
from the date of publication of this notice. Please address comments to the Assistant Attorney General, Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044

Martin Marietta Projection Display Products, Syracuse, NY; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration


On May 25, 1994, after being granted a filing extension, the company requested administrative reconsideration of
the Department's denial notice for workers at the subject firm. The notice was issued on March 30, 1994 and was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17570).
The company indicated that the Department's original survey was inadequate and submitted a supplemental list of
bid loss customers accounting for a major portion of its 1993 sales decline.


Conclusion


After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Government Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change
Relating to Minimum Financial Standards for Bank Netting System Members



June 8, 1994.



On April 18, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-94-03) pursuant to section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The proposed rule change lowers the minimum shareholders' equity standard for GSCC bank netting system members.
The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on May 9, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.





I. Description


The proposed rule change allows GSCC to change the minimum shareholders' equity standard for bank netting system
members. In 1989, prior to the commencement of GSCC's netting system, a minimum admission and continuance standard
of $250 million in shareholders' equity was established for banks or trust companies (``banks'') that are, or are
applying to become, members of GSCC's netting system.
 This level was chosen because, at the time, it encompassed roughly the one hundred largest banks in the United States
and, thus, reflected GSCC's initial focus on providing its netting and attendant risk protection services to only
the largest market participants.




The proposed rule change, however, lowers the minimum shareholders' equity standard for bank netting members to
$100 million. This standard will help ensure that each bank netting member, while not necessarily among the largest
banks in the country, is still a sizable one.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that GSCC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act,
 and in particular, sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act. Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) require that a clearing
agency be so organized and that its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of
securities transactions for which it is responsible and to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control
or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that GSCC's proposal is consistent with these goals.




The Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate broader access to the government securities market. Specifically,
it will allow a greater number of banks that are active participants in the government securities market to receive
the benefits of GSCC's services.

The Commission also believes that GSCC has established reasonable financial and operational requirements for the
admission of bank applicants. In addition to the minimum shareholders' equity standard, GSCC will explicitly impose
in its rules an additional standard on all bank netting system applicants and members. The capital ratios (

i.e., 

total risk-based ratio, tier 1 risk based ratio, and tier 1 leverage ratio) of all bank netting system applicants and
members must meet the minimum levels specified by the applicable bank regulatory agency. In conjunction with this
change, each bank netting member would be required to report periodically to GSCC each of its capital ratios for which
its appropriate regulatory authority has established standards (or the capital ratios that it would be required
to report to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Fed'') if it were a Fed member bank).


III. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, and in
particular with section 17A of the Act, and with the rules and regulations thereunder.

It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-GSCC-94-03) be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<USBUREAU>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</USBUREAU>






Fisher-Price, Inc.; Notice of Appeal of Denial of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance



Fisher-Price, Inc. (Fisher-Price), of East Aurora, New York, has appealed a decision by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) that denied Fisher-Price's petition that its noncompliance with Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' be deemed inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety (Docket No. 93-79; Notice 2, 59 FR 23253; May 5, 1994).

This notice of receipt of Fisher-Price's appeal is published in accordance with NHTSA regulations (49 CFR 556.7 and
556.8) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the appeal.

Paragraph S5.7 of FMVSS No. 213 states that ``[e]ach material used in a child restraint system shall conform to the
requirements of S4 of FMVSS No. 302 (`Flammability of Interior Materials') (571.302).'' Paragraph S4.3(a) of FMVSS
No. 302 states that ``[w]hen tested in accordance with S5, material described in S4.1 and S4.2 shall not burn, nor transmit
a flame front across its, surface, at a rate of more than 4 inches per minute.''

As noted in Notice 1 (58 FR 59511; November 9, 1993) of Docket No. 93-79, Fisher-Price determined that some of
its child safety seats failed to comply with FMVSS No. 213, and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573,
``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Fisher-Price petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy
requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Act) (15 U.S.C. 1381 

et seq.

) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety.

On May 5, 1994, NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 denying Fisher-Price's petition, stating that the petitioner had not met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. The reader is referred to that notice for a further discussion
of the noncompliance and the agency's rationale in denying the petition.

On May 6, 1994, Fisher-Price submitted an appeal of the agency's decision to deny its petition. The appeal contains
an analysis of the agency's decision, a summary of the supplemental information Fisher-Price submitted (which is
described below), and the affidavit of Gail E. McCarthy, Ph.D, P.E., of Failure Analysis Associates (FaAA).




Supplementary Information: 

Notice 1 to this docket established a 30-day public comment period, which expired on December 9, 1993. Nevertheless,
Fisher-Price submitted additional information related to its petition on three occasions: February 25, 1994, March
17, 1994, and March 24, 1994. Fisher-Price also submitted additional information with its May 6, 1994, appeal. These
materials are available for public review in the NHTSA docket.



The March 17, 1994, document contained research conducted by FaAA for Fisher-Price, including burn tests and a search
of the literature and accident data regarding child seat fires. The submission also included a calculation of an alleged
incremental risk associated with a recall of the noncompliant seats.

The March 24, 1994, document, entitled ``Supporting Documentation for Evaluation of the Fire Safety of Fisher-Price,
Inc. Child Restraint Shoulder Harness Webbing,'' contains the detailed data and test results on which the material
in the March 17, 1994, document was based.

Fisher-Price's May 6, 1994, appeal raised the following points: (1) In the notice of denial, NHTSA stated that Fisher-Price
``determined'' that some of its child restraints failed to comply with FMVSS No. 213; Fisher-Price states that it
has yet to make this determination. (2) In the notice of denial, NHTSA stated that it believes flammability requirements
for child restraints should be strictly adhered to; Fisher-Price believes that NHTSA should not hold child restraints
to what it perceives to be a stricter standard than is stated in the Act. (3) Fisher-Price cites the grant by NHTSA of
a petition for inconsequentiality filed by PACCAR, Inc. in which tape edging on a mattress had failed FMVSS No. 302
requirements (57 FR 45868; October 5, 1992). The petition was granted by NHTSA based in part on the fact that the tape
edging was a very small portion of the mattress. It also cites an appeal to a petition filed by the American Honda Motor
Co., Inc. (Honda) (49 FR 15046; April 16, 1984) which was granted. The agency's rationale for granting the appeal was
based in part on the fact that Honda had not received any complaints regarding the noncompliance. (4) Fisher-Price
claims that the data it submitted in support of its contention that children's clothing poses a much greater risk to
safety than the noncompliant webbing were not adequately refuted.

In the affidavit submitted with the appeal, Dr. McCarthy argues that: (1) The shoulder belt webbing should properly
be viewed as meeting the requirements of FMVSS No. 302; (2) any noncompliance that might be deemed to exist has no impact
on motor vehicle safety; and (3) possible remedial measures would create substantially greater risk of injury to
children than that presented by the webbing.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the appeal of Fisher-Price, described
above. Comments should refer to the docket and notice number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required
that six copies be submitted.

All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. All comments
received after the closing date will also be filed and will be considered to the extent feasible. When the appeal is
granted or denied, notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

Comment closing date: July 18, 1994.

Notice_Request for Proposals (RFP).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from U.S. not-for-profit organizations engaged
in international exchange programs to conduct research exchanges in the humanities and social sciences of pre- and/or
post-doctoral students and scholars with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Exchange
programs must recruit nationally and select participants through an open merit-based competitive process. Only
organizations with at least four years of experience in international exchange activities are eligible to apply.
Both existing and new projects are eligible. These exchanges are subject to the availability of funding for Fiscal
Year 1995.



Support is offered for two categories: Category A, Short-term (defined as being less than six months or the equivalent
of one academic year), and/or Long-term (the equivalent of at least six months or one academic year) Research Exchanges
with Armenia, Azerbaijan*, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan; and Category B, Short-term (defined as being less than six months or the equivalent
of one academic year), and/or Long-term (the equivalent of at least six months or one academic year) Research Exchanges
with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

Each category has separate conditions and requirements which are stated in this announcement. Institutions may
address one or both categories, but must submit a separate proposal for each category. Proposals for Category A may
include all 12 countries, a regional grouping of countries, or one country. Proposals for Category B may include one,
two or three of the listed countries. The goal of the program is to ensure the broadest geographic distribution in the
New Independent States, the Baltics, and the U.S. Programs should be for two-way exchanges, although they do not need
to be evenly reciprocal. Organizations may request funding for one or both sides of the exchange. Proposals for programs
that do not fit into either Category A or B will be considered technically ineligible.




*

Please note: 

Programs with Azerbaijan are subject to the restrictions of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act of 1992: Employees
of the Government of Azerbaijan or any of its instrumentalities are excluded from participation and no U.S. participant
overseas may work for the Government of Azerbaijan or any of its instrumentalities.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Overall authority for these exchanges is contained in the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as
amended, Public Law 87-256 (Fulbright-Hays Act). The purpose of the Act is ``to enable the Government of the
United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and people of other countries
by means of educational and cultural exchange; to strengthen the ties which unite us with other nations by demonstrating
the educational and cultural interests, developments, and achievements of the people of the United States and other
nations * * * and thus to assist in the development of friendly, sympathetic, and peaceful relations
between the United States and other countries of the world.'' Programs shall also ``maintain their scholarly integrity
and shall meet the highest standards of academic excellence or artistic achievement.'' Pursuant to the Bureau of
Educational and Cultural Affairs' authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character
and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Diversity
should be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to ethnicity, gender,
religion, geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged
to adhere to the advancement of this principle throughout the proposed program and within their own operations. 



Overview 



The Regional Scholar Exchange Program is intended to promote scholarly research by funding U.S. academic exchanges
of pre- and postdoctoral students and scholars (including graduate students, junior faculty, and senior scholars)
with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian
Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Participants must be citizens of the United States,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Ukraine, or Uzbekistan (Category A) or citizens of the United States, Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania (Category B).
Within the spirit of the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, the purposes of the Regional Scholar Exchange
Program are (1) to provide access by U.S. scholars to research sources in the countries listed above, (2) to provide
access by scholars from these countries to research sources in the United States, and (3) to encourage scholarly cooperation
in the humanities and social sciences. 



Guidelines 



Language Qualifications 



For both categories, foreign participants must have sufficient fluency in English and U.S. participants must have
sufficient fluency in the language of the host country to be able to conduct research. Escort-interpreters will not
be provided, nor funded by USIA.

Institutional Commitment 



Proposals must include documentation of institutional support for the proposed program in the form of signed letters
of endorsement from the U.S. and foreign partners' directors, or in the form of a signed agreement by the same persons.
Letters of endorsement must describe each institution's or organization's commitment and make specific reference
to the proposed program, each institution's activities in support of that program, and each institution's ability
to provide access to archival or manuscript repositories. Documentation of support from governmental ministries
or academies will be acceptable when appropriate, replacing individual documentation from each foreign educational
institution involved. Applicants must submit this documentation as part of the completed application; letters
and agreements will not be accepted if sent separately to USIA. Applying institutions are expected to make their own
arrangements with the appropriate foreign institutions. National ministries of educational and culture and academies
of science are included as eligible foreign partner institutions. 

Authorization to work in archives, manuscript repositories, and to use research materials is critical for U.S. scholars.
Proposals should include evidence of such authorization. 



Proposal Narrative 



The proposal narrative describing the program must conform to the Guidelines dated April 1993 and must include any
subgrants to be issued. All narratives must describe in detail the abilities of the participating organizations
to adapt to the changing exchanges environments in the countries eligible for participation in this program. 



Participant Selection 



The proposal must include detailed descriptions of the selection processes of participants, both foreign and American.
This must include procedures by which selecting officials are named. A goal for this program is to select students
and scholars from geographically diverse backgrounds in the home country and place them in wide geographic distribution
in the host country. 

Categories A and B (Short and Long-term Research Exchange): All scholars, at a minimum, must be Ph.D. candidates and
currently enrolled at or affiliated with a university. Applicants should not have travelled on a similar grant in
the last five years, or should have little opportunity to travel unless as a participant of this program. Applying
organizations must demonstrate the ability to conduct competitive award programs that are national in scope. Programs
must be based on an open, nationwide competition, incorporating peer group review mechanisms. 

The selection process for U.S. participants must be merit based. Selection criteria for the U.S. participants must
be based on: (1) Academic rigor of the participant's proposed project, including a demonstration of the need to study
abroad; (2) feasibility of the participant's proposed project, including time-frame and methodology; (3) language
proficiency in the language of the host country by the participant; and (4) a solid foundation of background knowledge
and research through general literature available in Western repositories. 

The selection process for foreign researchers should be merit based and the result of a country-wide or multi-country
wide competition. Selection criteria for the foreign participants should be based on: (1) Academic rigor of the participant's
proposed project, including a demonstration of the need to study abroad; (2) feasibility of the participant's proposed
project, including time-frame and methodology; (3) English language proficiency by the participant; and (4) a solid
foundation of background knowledge and research through general literature available in the repositories of the
foreign region. Although not a requirement, preference should be given to junior faculty holding lecturing positions.




Orientation Programs 



Participants should be provided with a substantive and comprehensive orientation to the countries of their visits,
and proposals should describe these orientation programs, including costs, in detail. 



Alumni Activities 



USIA recognizes the contributions of alumni to the goals of the program and the goals of the Mutual Educational and
Cultural Exchanges Act. Priority will be given to proposals which include detailed and comprehensive alumni tracking
and networking plans. Electronic mail access and training may be included in any such plans. 



Proposed Budget 



Funding anticipated for Category A is estimated at $1,300,000, which includes all program and administrative costs.
Funding anticipated for Category B is estimated at $240,000, which includes all program and administrative costs.


The following budgetary guidance applies to both Categories A and B: Project awards to U.S. organizations will be
made in a wide range of amounts. The Agency reserves the right to reduce, revise or increase proposal budgets in accordance
with the needs of the program. All organizations must submit a comprehensive line-item budget, the details and format
of which are contained in the application packet. The budget should list all sources of support for the program fiscal
year 1995 including both cash and in-kind contributions. 



Allowance Costs 



Grant-funded items of expenditure may include, but are not limited to, the following categories:

Additional Criteria for Category A


President's University Student Exchange Program (the 1000-1000 Student Exchange) With the Baltic Countries
and the New Independent States 


Grant funding under this category is intended to enhance and expand the scope of U.S. academic exchanges with undergraduate
and graduate students from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. For accident year 1995-96
the intention is to exchange 1,000 students in each direction. Priority will be given to applications from international
exchange organizations and consortia of universities that have a demonstrated ability to exchange students from
multiple countries in the former USSR. Preference will then be given to applications from single institutions for
programs outside the Russian Federation. For projects in the Russian Federation, preference will be given to applications
involving multiple foreign partner institutions, especially outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg. Both existing
and new projects are eligible. 


(1) Awards 


Project awards to U.S. organizations will be made in a wide range of amounts. The Agency reserves the right to reduce,
revise or increase proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the program. For organizations with less than
four years of experience in international exchange activities, grants will be limited to a maximum of $60,000, and
proposed budgets should not exceed this amount. 


(2) Participants 


Participants must be citizens either of the U.S. or of the host country. Undergraduate students are defined as students
who have not received their baccalaureates prior to participation in this program. Graduate students for this program
should be studying at the equivalent of the Master's degree level. Doctoral candidates are not eligible. Students
in all academic fields are eligible; students of agricultural are especially encouraged to apply (please note special
conditions for agricultural programs below). Projects that include graduate students must delineate between the
number of graduate and undergraduate participants, separately describe the academic programs, and include for
each a separate line item in the budget. All projects must include undergraduate students. It is important that the
selection process ensure equal opportunities for both male and female students. 


(3) Language Qualifications


Students should have sufficient fluency in the institutional language of the host country to be able to pursue university
study in that language and to be able to converse with the citizens of the country without the aid of interpreters. Generally,
the equivalent of two years of college-level study is considered the minimum. 


(4) Duration 


Applications will be accepted for projects with durations of at least eight weeks to no more than one year, including
programs lasting an academic quarter, trimester, or semester. Exchanges of less than eight weeks duration or more
than one year will be considered technically ineligible. Although grant awards may begin earlier, the actual exchange
of participants may not begin before February 1, 1995, and must be completed by December 31, 1996. Programs for exchanges
in subsequent academic years will be considered technically eligible. 


(5) Preference Factors 


a. Preference will be given to proposals in which incoming students study in the U.S. for a full academic year. 
b. Preference will be given to programs that reflect wide geographic distributions in recruitment of participants.

c. Preference will be given to programs that recruit foreign and U.S. participants through merit-based, open competition.



(6) Reciprocity 


Proposals should be reciprocal, but not necessarily equal in numbers. In cases where political or practical circumstances
do not allow for the placement of U.S. students, one-way programs will be considered. The proposal should provide
detailed information on the activities in both the U.S. and the partner country. 


(7) Internships


While programs may include internships, the focus of projects should be classroom work or research. If internships
are included in the exchange experience, students should have completed at least one semester of classroom work.
The duration of the internship should not exceed the duration of the classroom work. Institutions are encouraged
to grant academic credit for the internship experience. 


(8) Special Allowances for Agriculture Programs


In order to give added encouragement to the participation of students of agriculture as provided for in the bilateral
agreement, language standards may be modified for participating students of agriculture. Programs including agriculture
students need not exchange agriculture students in both directions. 


Additional Criteria for Categories B and C 


Category B: Samantha Smith Memorial Exchange With the Baltic Countries and the New Independent States 


Grant funding is intended to enhance and expand the scope of academic exchanges with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
Ukraine, and Uzbekistan for undergraduate students under the age of 26. Participants must be citizens either of the
U.S. or of the host country. Programs designed specifically for foreign participants to teach their native language
or area studies in American institutions are ineligible for support.

It is desirable, but not required, that exchange students have sufficient fluency in the language of the country to
be visited for the pursuit of university study in the language and to converse with citizens of the country without
the aid of interpreters. Generally, the equivalent of two years of college-level language study is considered the
minimum. The two-year language minimum will be waived for community colleges, two-year colleges, and non-profit
organizations working specifically with community colleges and/or two-year colleges in order to encourage their
participation. 



(2) Duration 



Applications will be accepted for projects with duration of at least eight weeks including programs lasting one academic
quarter, trimester, semester or a full year. Projects of less than eight weeks duration will be considered technically
ineligible. Grants generally will be made for exchanges occurring within a 12-month period, but requests for two-year
programs will be considered. Proposals for two-year programs should submit one budget that covers the entire two-year
period. The total award (one-or two-year) may not exceed $80,000. 



(3) Reciprocity 



It is desirable, but not required, that programs are reciprocal and the number of U.S. and foreign participants be
nearly equal. The proposal should provide detailed information on the activities in both the U.S. and the partner
country. 



(4) Awards 



Project awards will be made in a wide range of amounts up to $80,000. The Agency reserves the right to reduce, revise
or increase proposal budgets in accordance with the needs of the program. For organizations with less than four years
of experience in international exchange activities, grants will be limited to a maximum of $60,000 and proposed budgets
should not exceed this amount. All organizations must submit a comprehensive line item budget, the details and format
of which are contained in the application packet. 



(5) Preference Factors 



a. Preference will be given to programs in which U.S. participants will have had a minimum of two years of relevant language
study. 

b. Preference will be given to proposals in which incoming students study in the U.S. for a full academic year. 

c. Preference will be given to reciprocal exchanges. 



Review Process (All Categories) 



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. 

 




Please note:

 Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the Application
Package, including the Guidelines for Preparing Proposals.

Eligible Proposals 



Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
also be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area office, and the budget and contracts office. Funding decisions
are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority
for grant awards resides with USIA's grants officer. 



Review Criteria (All Categories) 




Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the following criteria: 



a. Quality of Program Plan 



Academic rigor, thorough conception of project, demonstration of meeting student needs, contributions to understanding
the partner country, proposed follow-up, and qualifications of program staff and participants. 



b. Feasibility of the Program Plan 



Capacity of the organization to conduct the exchange. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution
will meet the program objectives and plan. 



c. Track Record 



Revelant Agency and outside assessments of the organization's experience with international exchanges; for organizations
that have not worked with USIA before, the demonstrated potential to achieve program goals will be evaluated. 



d. Multiplier Effect/Impact 



The impact of the exchange activity on the wider community and on the development of continuing ties, as well as the
contribution of the proposed activity in promoting mutual understanding. 



e. Value of U.S._Partner Country Relations 



The assessment by USIA's geographic area office of the need, potential impact, and significance of the project with
the partner country. 



f. Cost-Effectiveness 



Greatest return on each grant dollar. A key measure of cost-effectiveness is the unit cost to the Agency. This is the
total request of USIA monies divided by the number of exchangees (people moved). The Agency also reviews the ratio
of cost-sharing exhibited. Cost-sharing through other financial support as well as institutional direct and in
kind funding contributions is strongly encouraged. 



g. Diversity and Pluralism (for Student Programs) 



Preference will be given to proposals that demonstrate efforts to provide for the participation of students with
a variety of major disciplines, from diverse regions, and of different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds, to
the extent feasible for the applicant institutions. 



h. Adherence of Proposed Activities 



To the criteria and conditions described above. 



i. Institutional Commitment 



Demonstrated by financial and other support to the program, including the provision for adequate and appropriate
personnel and institutional resources to achieve the program goals. 



j. Follow-on Activities 



Proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without USIA support) which insures that USIA-supported
programs are not isolated events. 



k. Evaluation Plan 



Proposals should provide a plan for evaluation by the grantee institution to determine the success of the project.

<DOCTITLE>International Creative Arts Exchanges for Public and Private Non-Profit Organizations</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Creative Arts Exchanges Division of the U.S. Information Agency's [USIA] Office of Arts America announces a program
of awards to private, non-profit organizations to support projects for artists and arts administrators. These will
consist of residencies and/or study tours in which artists from the United States and other countries work and learn
together. Interested applicants are invited to request and read the complete 

Federal Register 

announcement before submitting their proposals.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Creative Arts Exchanges Division works with U.S. non-profit organizations on cooperative international group
projects that introduce American and foreign participants to each other's cultural and artistic life and traditions.
It supports international projects in the United States or overseas involving composers, choreographers, filmmakers
[see guidance below], playwrights, theater designers, writers and poets, visual artists, museum professionals
[see guidance below], managers and administrators of arts institutions and organizations [see guidance below].


We particularly seek projects with organizations with expertise in the arts as well as broad outreach and networking
capabilities into American arts activities nationwide. On its side USIA offers prospective applicants its network
of U.S. Information Service [USIS] posts located in American embassies, consulates and cultural centers around
the world. Proposals making imaginative and substantive use of this USIS network will have a decided advantage in
the competition. Proposed projects should support the USIA mission to increase mutual understanding between the
United States and other countries and to promote international cooperation in educational and cultural fields.
USIS' role in such projects should be integral and not purely facilitative.

<DOCTITLE>International Educational and Cultural Activities Discretionary Grant Program</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice_Request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Education and Cultural
Affairs announces an open competition for an assistance award program. Public or private non-profit organizations

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non political character and should be
balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should
be interpreted in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion,
geographic location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges, Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere
to the advancement of this principle.





Overview:

 The Office of Citizen Exchanges works with U.S. private sector non-profit organizations on cooperative international
group projects that introduce American and foreign participants to each others' social, economic, and political
structures; and international interests. The Office supports international projects in the United States or overseas
involving leaders or potential leaders in the following fields and professions: Urban planners, jurists, specialized
journalists (specialists in economics, business, political analysis, international affairs), business professionals,
NGO leaders, environmental specialists, parliamentarians, educators, economics planning, and other government
officials.



Guidelines: 

Applicants should carefully note the following restrictions/recommendations for proposals in specific geographical
areas:



The Newly Independent States: 

USIA and other agencies of the U.S. government have numerous programs in the countries of the NIS (Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan).
As such, the amount of funds for that part of the world in this competition will be extremely limited. Proposals which
would normally be considered for other USIA grant competitions will not be accepted. E/P encourages organizations
to seek clarification on these points before presenting a proposal.



Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Baltics (EU): 

Projects are encouraged involving Western Europe. Due to the fact that the office has or is in the process of conducting
specific competitions in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, we will not accept proposals for youth exchange programs
or for programs in the following thematic areas: public administration, business management, independent media
development, journalism training, and local government administration and municipal management. Priority will
be given to projects relating to conflict resolution, tolerance, and diversity.



East Asia and the Pacific (EA): 

Priority consideration will be given to the following: (1) Projects for journalists (print or electronic). Priorities
are projects for Hong Kong and Singapore combined or for Thailand on press freedom, the press/government relationship,
and the role of a free press in society. Other projects for journalists include regional/subregional projects that
focus on APEC-related economic and trade issues and policies or regional/subregional projects that focus on security
issues. The projects may consist of but are not limited to workshops, site tours, seminars and discussions and internships.
(2) Projects concerned with the strengthening of democracy in Cambodia, with priority given to projects that focus
on education and representative government. (3) Projects concerned with the organization, management, and administration
of citizen action groups or other non-governmental organizations in the Peoples' Republic of China and Southeast
Asian countries. Priority will be given to subject areas, such as grass roots democracy, the environment, and human
rights.



American Republics (AR): 

Priority will be given to projects in the following areas: Good governance, public administration, decentralization
of government, judicial reform, and the protection/promotion of minority and indigenous rights.



Africa (AF): 

While proposals in all fields are encouraged, emphasis will be given to proposals which focus on strengthening democratic
institutions. Proposals involving South Africa are encouraged.

North Africa, Near East and South Asia (NEA)

: Priority will be given to projects which promote democratization, economic reform, free markets, tolerance and
pluralism, conflict resolution, and Israeli and Palestinian understanding. The Office of Citizen Exchanges strongly
encourages the coordination of activities with respected universities, professional associations, and major
cultural institutions in the U.S. and abroad, but particularly in the U.S. Projects should be intellectual and cultural,
not technical. Vocational training (an occupation other than one requiring a baccalaureate or higher academic degree;
i.e., clerical work, auto maintenance, etc. and other occupations requiring less than two years of higher education)
and technical training (special and practical knowledge of a mechanical or a scientific subject which enhances mechanical,
narrowly scientific, or semi-skilled capabilities) are ineligible for support. In addition, scholarship programs
are ineligible for support.

The Office does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars (i.e., one to fourteen-day programs with
plenary sessions, main speakers, panels, and a passive audience). It will support conferences only insofar as they
are part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition. USIA-supported
projects may include internships; study tours; short-term, non-technical training; and extended, intensive workshops
taking place in the United States or overseas.

The themes addressed in exchange programs must be of long-term importance rather than focused exclusively on current
events or short-term issues. In every case, a substantial rationale must be presented as part of the proposal, one
that clearly indicates the distinctive and important contribution of the overall project, including where applicable
the expected yield of any associated conference.

No funding is available exclusively to send U.S. citizens to conferences or conference-type seminars overseas;
neither is funding available for bringing foreign nationals to conferences or to routine professional association
meetings in the United States.

Projects that duplicate what is routinely carried out by private sector and/or public sector operations will not
be considered. The Office of Citizen Exchanges strongly recommends that applicants consult with host country USIS
post, prior to submitting proposals.



Section of Participants



All grant proposals should clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. It is recommended that programs in support of U.S. internships include letters
tentatively committing host institutions to support the internships.

In the selection of foreign participants, USIA and USIS posts retain the right to nominate all participants and to
accept or deny participants recommended by grantee institutions. However, grantee institutions are often asked
by USIA to suggest names of potential participants. The grantee institution will also provide the names of American
participants and brief (two pages) biographical data on each American participant to the Office of Citizen Exchanges
for information purposes. Priority will be given to foreign participants who have not previously travelled to the
United States.

Additional Guidance



The Office of Citizen Exchanges offers the following additional guidance to prospective applicants:

1. The Office of Citizen Exchanges encourages project proposals involving more than one country. Pertinent rationale
which links countries in multi-country projects should be included in the submission. Single-country projects
that are clearly defined and possess the potential for creating and strengthening continuing linkages between foreign
and U.S. institutions are also welcome.

2. Proposals for bilateral programs are subject to review and comment by the USIS post in the relevant country, and
pre-selected participants will also be subject to USIS post review.

3. Bilateral programs should clearly identify the counterpart organization and provide evidence of the organization's
participation.

4. The Office of Citizen Exchanges will consider proposals for activities which take place exclusively in other countries
when USIS posts are consulted in the design of the proposed program and in the choice of the most suitable venues for
such programs.

5. Office of Citizen Exchanges grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical or vocational
subjects, or for research projects, for publications funding, for student and/or teacher/faculty exchanges, for
sports and/or sports related programs. Nor does this office provide scholarships or support for long-term (a semester
or more) academic studies. Competitions sponsored by other Bureau offices are also announced in the 

Federal Register

.

For projects that would begin after July 1, 1995, competition details will be announced in the 

Federal Register

 on or about December 1, 1994. Inquiries concerning technical requirements are welcome prior to submission of applications.



Funding



Although no set funding limit exists, proposals for less than $150,000 will receive preference. Organizations with
less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
Applicants are invited to provide both an all-inclusive budget as well as separate sub-budgets for each program component,
phase, location, or activity in order to facilitate USIA decisions on funding. While an all-inclusive budget must
be provided with each proposal, separate component budgets are optional. Competition for USIA funding support is
keen.

The selection of grantee institutions will depend on program substance, cross-cultural sensitivity, and ability
to carry out the program successfully. Since USIA grant assistance constitutes only a portion of total project funding,
proposals should list and provide evidence of other anticipated sources of financial and in-kind support.

The Recipient must provide a minimum of 33 percent cost sharing of the total project cost. Cost sharing may be in the
form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable
costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government.
Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in
accordance with OMB Circular A-110, Attachment E-Cost Sharing and Matching and should be described in the proposal.
In the event the Recipient does not provide a minimum of 33 percent cost sharing, the Agency's contribution will be
reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution. Proposals with cost sharing of less than 33 percent of the
total project cost will be considered ineligible. The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:
(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92-9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor
of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133,
AICPA SOP 92-9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. The following
project costs are eligible for consideration for funding:

1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs.

2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the
published Federal per diem rates must be used. NOTE: U.S. escorting staff must use the published Federal per diem rates,
not the flat rate.

3. Interpreters: If needed, interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language
Services Division. Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation.
USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal
budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each Department of State interpreter, as well as home-program-home
air transportation of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are
covered centrally and should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget.

4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to and escorts are reimbursed a one-time cultural allowance
of $150 per person, plus a participant book allowance of $50. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.

5. Consultants. May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal.

6. Room rental, which generally should not exceed $250 per day.

7. Materials development. Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.

8. One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5-$8 for a lunch and $14-$20 for a dinner;

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchanges (E/P) of the United States Information Agency's Bureau of Educational and Cultural
Affairs announces a competitive grant program for nonprofit organizations to conduct a project for enhancing professional
development in English language teaching at the secondary level in Israel (both Arab and Jewish communities), Gaza,
and the West Bank. Participants will be professionals responsible for developing effective English language teaching
programs; emphasis will be on curriculum development, teaching methodology, production of classroom-appropriate
material, and organizing professional associations and networks. 



A second, underlying, agenda of this project is to convene, on an egalitarian basis and on neutral territory, a group
of Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians who will work together within a professional discipline_in this
case, English language teaching_and who will, upon returning to their own communities, both maintain professional,
mutually supportive contact and represent, within those communities, the feasibility of collegial relationships
between Jews, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians. 

The program will be conducted in English. 

Interested applicants are urged to read the complete 

Federal Register

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office of Citizen Exchanges or submitting their proposals. After
the RFP deadline, the Office of Citizen Exchanges may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until
the final decisions are made. 

 


ANNOUNCEMENT NAME AND NUMBER: 

All communications with USIA concerning this announcement should refer to the above title and reference number E/P-94-31.

Participants should become thoroughly conversant with state-of-the-art theory and practice of teaching English
as a second language. They should observe and participate in classroom and language lab instruction, become involved
in the complexities of curriculum development, and produce guidelines for and examples of classroom-appropriate
teaching material. In addition, they should be introduced to professional associations and networks of teachers,
curriculum developers, and education officials, providing them models of professional cooperation and information
exchange which will be useful in establishing cross-cultural professional linkages in the region.

The second phase of the project should take place over a period of approximately six months and should entail the travel
at approximately eight-to-ten-week intervals, of four American specialists/consultants. Each specialist will
conduct a series of two-to-three-day workshops on one or more of the key issues addressed in the initial phase of the
exchange (e.g., curriculum development; teaching methodology; in-service training), in each of the locations
in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank from which participants in the original phase were drawn.



Participants



Participants' professional titles will vary from community to community, given the independent development of
educational supervisory/oversight institutions in Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank. They might be drawn from the
Ministry of Education, the ranks of consultants to the educational establishment, teachers' unions, professional
committees, or teacher training institutions. All will be responsible, in some capacity, for the development of
effective English language teaching programs. Participants will be selected by United States Information Service
officers (The United States Information Agency's overseas contingent is officially called the United States Information
Service) serving in the American Embassy in Tel Aviv and the American Consulate in Jerusalem. Individuals may also
be recommended for participation by the grantee institution, but selection will be made only in close consultation
with USIS officers. American consultants who will travel abroad during the second phase of this exchange program
will be selected by the grantee institution in consultation with USIA.

USIA officers in participating countries will facilitate the issuance of visas and other program-related material.



Programmatice Considerations



Thematically, the project should:



_Consider the current status of English Language instruction in the communities represented by the participants
and determine, in conjunction with USIS posts in Israel and Jerusalem and with the educators selected as participants,
the needs to be addressed by the project;

_Provide the participants both a general and specific overview of English Language education_focussing specifically
on teaching English as a second language_as it is practiced in the United States, in the context of a socially diverse
country;

_Be organized, to the extent possible, around open seminar/discussions, participant observation, and hands-on,
experiential learning;

_Introduce participants to the organization and workings of professional associations of educators and other means
of information exchange, such as internet, which would provide continued access to diverse ideas, publications,
etc.;

_And include, if feasible, attendance at the TESOL international convention in Long Beach, California, March 28-April
1, 1995.

Pursuant to the legislation authorizing the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, programs must maintain
a nonpolitical character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social,
and cultural life.

Beyond the immediate goals of this program, USIA is interested in supporting programs which will lay the groundwork
for new and continuing links among American, Israeli, and Palestinian institutions and professional organizations
and which will encourage the further growth and development of democratic structures.

The grantee will be responsible for most arrangements associated with this program. These include organizing a coherent
progression of activities, providing international and domestic travel arrangements for all participants, making
lodging and local transportation arrangements for visitors, orienting and debriefing participants, preparing
any necessary support material, and working with host institutions and individuals to achieve maximum program effectiveness.

To prepare the foreign educators for this project prior to their arrival in the United States, E/P encourages the grantee
organization to develop material that would be sent to USIS offices overseas for distribution to participants. This
material might include a tentative project outline and suggested goals and objectives, relevant background information,
and information about American institutions and individuals involved in the project.

At the beginning of the program, the grantee organization should conduct an orientation session for the visiting
participants which addresses administrative details of the program and provides general information about American
society and culture which will facilitate the participants' understanding of and adjustment to daily life in the
United States.

At the conclusion of the program, the group should meet in a symposium to review what has been presented to and experienced
by the participants and to consider how that which has been learned can most effectively be applied upon the participants'
return to their home countries.



Additional Guidelines



Program monitoring and oversight will be provided by appropriate USIA elements. Per Diem support from host institutions
during an internship component is strongly encouraged. However, for all programs which include internships, a nonprofit
grantee institution which receives funds from corporate or other co-sponsors should then use those funds to provide
food, lodging, and pocket money for the participants. In no case could the intern receive a wage or ``be hired'' by the
sponsoring institution.

Internships should also have an American studies/values orientation component at the beginning of the program.
The American grantee institutions should try to maximize cost-sharing in all facets of the program, and to stimulate
U.S. private sector (foundation and corporate) support.

Proposals incorporating internships will be more competitive if letters committing prospective host institutions
to support these efforts are provided.



Funding



Competition for USIA funding support is keen. The final selection of a grantee institution will depend on assessment
of proposals according to the review criteria delineated below.

The amount requested from USIA for this program should not exceed $135,000. However, organizations with less than
four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.

While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate
sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.

The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: (1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular
No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions; (2) complies with
the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No.
92-9; and (3) includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental
schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.

The audit costs shall be identified separately for: (1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting
services; and (2) preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133,
AICPA SOP 92-9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.

USIA will consider funding the following project costs:

1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.


2. 


Per diem

: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for international participants or the
published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities.








Note:

 U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle
East the Standard Government Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.





3. 


Book and cultural allowance

: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a participant book allowance
of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.


4. 


Consultants

: May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Honoraria should not exceed $250 per day.
Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written contract(s) must be included in the proposal.


5. 


Room rental (for meeting or conference rooms)

: Generally should not exceed $250 per day.


6. 


Material development

: Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop and translate material for participants. USIA reserves the rights
to this material for future use.


7. 


One working meal per project

: Per capita cost may not exceed $5-8 per lunch and $14-20 per dinner, excluding room rental. The number
of invited guests may not exceed the number of participants by a factor of more than two to one.


8. 


Return travel allowance

: $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during international travel.



9. Other costs necessary for the effective administration of the program, including salaries for grant organization
employees, benefits, and other direct and indirect costs per detailed instructions in application package.








Note:

 the 22% limitation of ``administrative costs'' included in previous announcements does NOT apply to this RFP.






E/P encourages cost-sharing, which may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. E/P would be especially
interested in proposals which demonstrate a program vision which goes well beyond that which can be supported by the
requested USIA grant and which would try to use a USIA grant to leverage additional funding from other sources to support
elements of the broader program plan.



The Recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution
to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal Government. Such records are subject to audit. The
basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A-110,
Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing and Matching,'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient
does not meet the minimum amount of cost-sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution
will be reduced in proportion to the Recipient's contribution.








Please Note

 all delegates will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid by USIA
directly to the insurance company.




Application Requirements





Proposals must be structured in accordance with the instructions contained in the Application Package. Confirmation
letters from U.S. and foreign co-sponsors noting their intention to participate in the program will enhance a proposal.



Review Process

by the Office of the General Counsel or other Agency elements. Funding is at the discretion of the Associate Director
for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for granting awards resides with USIA's contracting
officer. The awarding of any grant is subject to availability of funds.

<ACTION>
ACTION NOTICE: 

Request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from U.S. educational, cultural, and other not-for-profit
institutions to conduct exchanges of young persons between the ages of 14 and 17 years of age with the twelve Newly Independent
States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union; viz., Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. These exchanges represent part of the activities
of the Secondary School Student Exchange Initiative as included in the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992 and are subject
to the availability of funding for the Fiscal Year 1995 program. This is a request for proposals for short term thematic
exchanges. Requests for proposals in support of other programs under the aegis of the FREEDOM Support Act are being
published separately.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Overall authority
for these programs is contained in the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law 87-256
(Fulbright-Hays Act).






Overview:





Grant funding is intended to promote the exchange of secondary school students, from 14 to 17 years of age, between
the United States and the NIS (Newly Independent States) of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Limited funding is also available
to support leadership development and training for adults in NIS non-governmental organizations who work with youth,
when such an activity is coupled with a youth exchange program. The Agency's main objectives are to foster interaction
between American and foreign youth, to promote democratic values and the development of democratic institutions,
and to build sustainable partnerships between organizations in the United States and organizations in the former
Soviet Union. It is important that all projects make interaction between the American and NIS participants a central
focus of their activities. Proposals should demonstrate how American and foreign participants will interact in
a substantive way that encourages the exchange of ideas, culture, values, and information.





Four different program designs will be utilized in the NIS Secondary School Initiative: (A) An academic year program,
(B) a semester exchange program (C) a school-to-school linkage program, and (D) a short-term exchange program. This
RFP describes the short-term program. Other RFPs will be published separately soliciting proposals for the other
three programs.

Guidelines for Short-Term Exchanges



Grants will be awarded to support programs of a three to eight week duration. Programs should have a thematic focus.
Proposals which address civics education and the American political system are encouraged. Other eligible foci
may include, but are not limited to: The arts; language and culture; science; computer technology; leadership training;
conservation and the environment; journalism; social and economic issues; agriculture; business administration/management
(including enterprise promotion); and homestay programs under the title ``American Community Experience,'' which
should include local programming in such areas as state and municipal government, regional culture, etc. Proposals
should provide detailed information on activities planned in both the U.S. and the partner country. It is important
for program activities to be of a substantive nature. These may include excursions, cultural activities, and opportunities
to experience community life. It is very desirable for each group of NIS students to have a segment of their program
in Washington, DC or a state capital. Care should be taken to avoid proposing a program which is too heavily weighted
toward ``touristic'' activities.

One-for-one reciprocity is not a requirement, but is encouraged. Proposals should also provide written evidence
that the U.S. organization has the commitment of a reliable counterpart organization in the partner country willing
and able to engage in the proposed activities. Homestays are desirable. The minimum stay in country for all programs
is three weeks.

The core of the proposal narrative should articulate the purposes of the project, as they relate to the objectives
stated above in the ``Overview,'' and should describe the program elements. Guidelines for preparing the narrative
are available from USIA (address and telephone number provided above).

Projects requesting support for tours of performing arts groups or sports teams are eligible only if the primary purpose
of the program is mutual education and there is extensive structured interaction and cultural exchange between international
participants and their hosts. Tours of performing arts groups or sports groups for whom the primary activity is performance
or competition will not be eligible. Outdoor camping projects must have a thematic focus. Proposals must include
a plan for evaluating the program in terms of its value to the participants. Unless there are extenuating circumstances,
programs should maintain a ratio of not more than one adult per every ten young people. (If fewer than ten students are
being sent on either side of an exchange, those students are entitled to one adult escort). Programs requesting an
exception to the 1/10 ratio must provide a justification. One justifiable exception would be for those projects that
include leadership development and training for adult leaders. Organizations wishing to pay for additional escorts
from their own funds are free to do so.

Grantee organizations are responsible for developing a sustainable partnership with an organization in the NIS;
designing and implementing the components of the exchange; managing all travel arrangements, logistics, insurance
coverage, passports, visas, etc; and disbursing and accounting for funds.

Budget



The organization must submit a comprehensive line item budget. Costs for US and NIS students are to be listed separately.
Details are available in the application packet. Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years
of experience in conducting international exchange programs will be limited to $60,000. Organizations should be
familiar with grant regulations described in OMB circulars A110, A122, and A133.

Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The grant recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E_Cost Sharing and
Matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost
sharing as stipulated will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution.



Review Process



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet.
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
also be reviewed by the appropriate geographical office of the U.S. Information Agency, and the Agency's budget and
contract offices. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Agency's Office of the General Counsel. Funding decisions
are at the discretion of the Associate Director of Education and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for
grant awards resides with the Agency's Office of Contracts.



Review Criteria



Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the following criteria:



1. Quality of the Program Idea



Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, rigor, and adherence to the criteria and conditions described
above.



2. Reasonable, Feasible, and Flexible Objectives



Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution will meet the program's objectives and plan.



3. Multiplier Effect/Impact



Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages. A program is also considered to have a strong
``multiplier effect'' if it affects a significant number of persons in addition to the actual program participants.
For example, a group of high school students may have extensive interaction with community groups.



4. Value to U.S._Partner Country Relations



Assessments by USIA's geographic area desk, and USIS officers overseas of the need, potential, impact, and significance
in the partner country(ies), as demonstrated by a sustainable partnership with an organization in the former Soviet
Union.



5. Cost Effectiveness



The overhead and administrative components of grants, as well as salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible.
All other items should be necessary and appropriate. Proposals should to the extent possible maximize cost-sharing
through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding contributions. Other things being
equal, a proposal with a low cost per participant and/or a low cost per participant program day will have a competitive
advantage.



6. Institutional Capacity



The proposed personnel and institutional resources of both the U.S. applicant and the NIS partner organization should
be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's goals.



7. Proposals Should Demonstrate Potential for Program Excellence and/or Track Record of Applicant Institution



The Agency will consider the past performance of prior grantees and the demonstrated potential of new applicants.
A documented record of successful exchange programs, whether USIA financed or not, is one way in which an applicant
may demonstrate strength in this area.



8. Follow-On Activities



In accordance with the stated objective of a sustainable partnership with an organization in the former Soviet Union,
proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity which ensures that USIA supported programs are
not isolated events.



9. Evaluation Plan



Proposals should provide a thoughtful and comprehensive description of how the project will be evaluated in terms
of meeting the objectives listed above and how such an evaluation would present quantitative data on participants,
contacts, interactions, activities, achievements, etc., as well as qualitative appraisals of successes and shortcomings
and suggestions for program improvement.



10. Selection Process



All participants must be between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time they begin the program. In all cases, selection should
be merit-based. Selection criteria should include actual or potential leadership qualities, and may also include
some or all of the following: Maturity, academic achievement, interest in the program, motivation, recommendations
of teachers, and language ability, although no participant should be chosen solely on the basis of his or her language
ability. As far as possible, participants should reflect the diversity of the communities from which they come. Ability
to pay should not be a determining factor for either American or foreign participants.



11. Geographic Diversity



To the extent possible, the Agency will seek to fund programs from different geographic areas within the former Soviet
Union and within the United States.



12. Participant Diversity



Programs should strive for a diversity of participants and include members of underrepresented groups; e.g., racial

<DOCTITLE>Samantha Smith Memorial Exchange Program_Youth Exchanges</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for proposals.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from U.S. educational, cultural, and other not-for-profit
institutions to conduct exchanges of youth under the age of 21 with Central and Eastern Europe: Albania, Croatia,
Slovenia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia, and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macdeonia, or the Newly Independent States (NIS) of Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.
Proposals may address more than one country in each area but cannot combine NIS countries with those of Central and
Eastern Europe. However, organizations may submit two different proposals for these two geographic areas. These
exchanges represent part of the activities of the Samantha Smith Memorial Exchange Program and are subject to the
availability of funding for the Fiscal Year 1995 program. A request for proposals in support of exchanges of college
and university undergraduate students under the AEGIS of the Samantha Smith program will be published separately
by the office of Academic Exchanges.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. Overall authority
for these programs is contained in the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchanges Act of 1961, as amended, Public Law
87-256 (Fulbright-Hays Act).




Overview


Grant funding is intended to promote the exchange of young people 21 years of age or younger between the U.S. and the
Newly Independent States (NIS) or Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, and the Central and Eastern European countries of Albania,
Bosnia-Hercegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Proposals may address more than one country in
each area, for example, a project with Bulgaria, Latvia, and Slovenia, or Belarus, Moldova, and Kyrgyzstan. Proposals
cannot combine NIS countries with those of Central and Eastern Europe. The Agency's main objective is to foster interaction
between American and foreign youth. Consequently, extensive interaction is a requirement. Proposals should demonstrate
how American and foreign youth will interact in a way that encourages the exchange of ideas, values, culture, and information.
This competition will give priority consideration to projects taking place in Russia in areas other than Moscow and
St. Petersburg, and to projects taking place outside of capital cities in all the eligible countries.

Twenty-five percent (25%) of the available funds will be reserved for organizations that have not received Samantha
Smith grants in the past year. Grants are awarded to expand or enhance existing exchange programs or to encourage the
development of new exchanges. Programs may involve the U.S. organization in a partnership with organizations in
one or more countries. The minimum length of stay in country for a project should be three weeks.
Two categories of grants are being offered.


Category A_School-to-School Exchanges


A school-to-school exchange is one that involves a direct linkage between a U.S. and a Central and Eastern European
or NIS elementary, middle, or high school, or a two-year college. (4-year colleges and universities are not eligible
under this competition). An applicant must be a school, school district, or two-year college. The maximum grant for
this category is $15,000. The exchange program activity should be reciprocal and permit students to live in each other's
countries during the academic year when schools are in session. (This would include officially-sponsored summer
school sessions). The proposal should provide detailed information on the classroom and other activities in both
the U.S. and the partner country. The duration of the projects may be one academic year, one semester, or short-term
(generally understood to mean three to eight weeks). Organizations which are receiving funding under other USIA
grants for youth exchanges must insure that proposals submitted under this solicitation do not duplicate or overlap
with programs already being funded by USIA.


Category B_General Youth Exchange


This category includes all other projects, which will be eligible for grants of up to $75,000. Semester and year-long
high school or two-year college study programs conducted by exchange organizations may fall within this category,
as may projects involving the annual exchange of groups of students and teachers among several linked schools for
short-term stays during the academic year. (4-year colleges and universities are not eligible under this competition).
For short-term (3-8 weeks) exchanges, preference is given to projects with a thematic focus. Eligible foci
may include, but are not limited to: The arts (theater, dance, music, fine arts, literature, folklore, and film/video);
language and culture; science, technology, and mathematics; conservation and the environment; historic preservation;
museum training; social, political, and economic issues; agriculture; business and administration/management
(including enterprise promotion). While a thematic focus is not an absolute requirement, care should be taken to
avoid proposing a program which is too heavily weighted toward ``touristic'' activities and lacking in substance.
Projects requesting support for tours of performing arts groups or sports teams are eligible if the primary purpose
of the program is interaction among international participants and their hosts. Tours of performing arts groups
or sports groups where the primary activity is performance or competition are not eligible.
Reciprocity is not a requirement for this category, but in general, USIA gives preference to proposals for reciprocal
exchanges. The proposal should provide detailed information on the activities in both the U.S. and the partner country.
The number of U.S. and foreign participants should be roughly equal. Such proposals must provide written evidence
of the commitment of a counterpart organization in the partner country willing and able to engage in the proposed activities.
In most cases the counterpart organization should assume a significant portion of the cost of hosting the American
participants in the reciprocal portion of the program.


Guidelines


All categories of proposals must include: Participant selection criteria and a description of the selection process.
All participants must be under the age of 21 at the time they begin the program. In all cases, selection should be merit-based.
Selection criteria should include actual or potential leadership qualities, and may also include some or all of the
following: maturity, academic achievement, interest in the program, motivation, recommendations of teachers,
and language ability, although no participant should be chosen solely on the basis of language ability. As far as possible,
participants should reflect the diversity of the communities from which they come. Ability to pay should not be a determining
factor for either American or foreign participants.


Description of Orientation Programs


There should be ample introduction to the program theme, administrative procedures, basic historical, cultural,
and social information, and substantive issues likely to be raised by their U.S. or foreign counterparts. The orientation
program should help minimize the ``culture shock'' of the participants when they are in the partner country.


Information Concerning Stays in the Host Country


Preference is generally given to longer stays in-country. The proposal should describe in detail the selection and
orientation processes for both U.S. and host families and institutions. Consideration will be given to those projects
which for reasons or requirements of the partner country(ies) are of short duration, but the length of stay in country
should be a minimum of three weeks.


Information Concerning Language Qualifications


Speaking ability in the language of the host country for both American and foreign participants is preferred, but
not required. It is recognized that relatively few American young people will speak the languages of the host countries,
given the fact that relatively few American schools teach these languages. Ideally, some participants in each incoming
delegation should be conversant in English, and some participants in each outgoing delegation should be conversant
in the host country language. However, no participant should be selected solely on the basis of his or her language
ability.

Details on Planning


The proposal should show evidence of adequate lead/planning time to ensure a successful exchange program. A proposed
time frame should also be included, as should provisions for monitoring and evaluating the program.


Proposed Budget


Organizations must submit a comprehensive line item budget for which specific details are available in the application
packet.
Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years of experience in conducting international exchange
programs will be limited to $60,000. Organizations should be familiar with grant regulations described in OMB circulars
A110, A122, and A133.
Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The grant recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as cost to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E_Cost Sharing and
Matching, and should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of
cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion to
the recipient's contribution.


Allowable Costs


Grant-funded expenditures will generally be limited to the following categories:



_In-country travel and per diem; i.e., lodging, meals, clothing, maintenance, and incidentals, or stipends.
_Orientation, honoraria, or preparation costs; briefing materials. Honoraria is limited to $150/day/speaker.
_Educational and cultural enrichment activities up to a limit of $150 per program youth participant.
_Tuition, conference/seminar registration fees, and other program admission fees.
_International travel, normally limited to partial support for Americans traveling to the NIS, Baltic Republics,
or Central and East Europe, and Central and East Europeans traveling to the U.S. The American participants and/or
the American organization should be encouraged to fund a portion of the Americans' travel costs, although full funding
of participants from economically disadvantaged backgrounds is encouraged. The NIS partner organizations should
also be encouraged to make a contribution toward international travel, but in this regard one should avoid a situation
in which participants are chosen largely or wholly on the basis of their ability to pay, thus creating an unrepresentative
group. In some cases 100% of the travel costs for NIS participants will be paid from USIA funds.
_Proposals should demonstrate substantial cost sharing in both program and administrative expenses.


Review Process


USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application package. Eligible
proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will also be reviewed
by the appropriate geographic area office, and the budget and contracts offices. Proposals may also be reviewed by
the Agency's Office of General Counsel. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational
and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with the USIA's grants officer.


Review Criteria


Technically eligible applications will be reviewed according to the following criteria in addition to what has been
outlined already in this RFP:


1. Quality of Program Idea


Quality of the program plan and adherence of proposed activities to the criteria and conditions described above.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940616-2-00143 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-2-00094 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Reasonable, Feasible, and Flexible Objectives



Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution will meet the program's objectives and plan.



3. Multiplier Effect/Impact



Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information
and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages. A program is also considered to have a strong
``multiplier effect'' if it affects a significant number of persons in addition to the actual program participants.
For example, a group of high school students may have extensive interaction with community groups.



4. Value to U.S._Partner Country Relations



Assessments by USIA's geographic area desk, and overseas officers of the need, potential, impact, and significance
in the partner country(ies).



5. Cost Effectiveness



The overhead and administrative components of grants, as well as salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible.
Proposals which utilize grant funds for program rather than administrative costs will, in general, be more favorably
reviewed. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. Proposals should to the extent possible maximize
cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding contributions. Other
things being equal, a proposal with a low cost per participant and/or a low cost per participant program day will have
an advantage.



6. Institutional Capacity



Proposed personnel and institutional resources should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's
goals.



7. Institution's Track Record/Ability



Proposals should demonstrate potential for program excellence and/or the track record of applicant institution.
The Agency will consider the past performance of prior grantees and the demonstrated potential of new applicants.
A documented record of successful exchange programs, whether USIA financed or not, is one way in which an applicant
may demonstrate strength in this area.



8. Follow-on Activities



Proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity (without USIA support) which insures that USIA
supported programs are not isolated events.



9. Evaluation Plan



Proposals should provide a plan for evaluation of the program by the grantee institution.



10. Participant Diversity



Programs should strive for a diversity among participants and include members of underrepresented groups; e.g.,
racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities.



Notice



The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by the Agency that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does
not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government. Final awards cannot be made until funds have been
fully appropriated by Congress, allocated and committed through internal USIA procedures.



Notification



All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process by February, 1995. Awarded grants will be subject
to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The United States Information Agency (USIA) invites applications from U.S. educational, cultural and other not-for-profit
institutions to provide materials, training and facilitative support on programming for youth with disabilities
for USIA grantee organizations administering international exchanges. This program is sponsored under the Secondary
School Exchange Initiative as originally authorized under the Freedom Support Act of 1992. Funding for this program
is subject to the availability of a Congressional authorization and appropriation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Overall authority
for NIS Secondary School exchanges is contained in the Freedom Support Act (Pub. L. 102-391).


Overview


Grant funding is intended to assist one organization over a one-year period to provide training, materials and facilitative
support about programming of people with disabilities for organizations funded by the NIS Secondary School Initiative.
The purpose of the training is to promote access to Initiative programs for youth with disabilities. Materials should
support the training and supplement this goal where training is unfeasible. Facilitative support should foster
connections between secondary school exchange organizations in the US with organizations serving persons with
disabilities; also promote links with similar organizations in the following countries with organizations recruiting
students for NIS-US exchange programs: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kryrgyzstan,
Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan. This grant is not intended to sponsor the actual
exchange of students.
Students selected for exchanges under the NIS Secondary School Initiative are aged 14 to 17 years old. Proposals should
focus on increasing access to exchange opportunities by participants within this age range.

A maximum of one grant will be awarded for this project. 


Guidelines


The components of this program and their respective purposes are:


(1) Training


To enlighten organizations that recruit, select, place and educate students supported under the Freedom Support
Act Secondary School Exchange Program about the importance of integration of participants with disabilities into
their programs; to train these organizations in the logistics of handling the needs of a participant with a disability
and provide supporting materials needed for training; to provide materials needed for continued training within
organizations. 


(2) Materials


To provide reference materials for organizations which do not participant in the above-mentioned training; to compile
information about accessible educational facilities abroad, and; 


(3) Facilitative Assistance


To facilitate connections between organizations to the NIS which provide support for persons with disabilities
and the organizations which recruit, select and place students participating in NIS-US exchange programs;
to facilitate connections between organizations in the US that provide support for persons with disabilities and
organizations in the US which recruit, select, and place students participating in US-NIS exchange programs.

The following factors should be considered in preparing proposals.



_The Secondary School Initiative funds programs administered by over 50 different organizations in the United States.
It is anticipated that this training will involve many, but not all, of these organizations. The final number of trainees
is subject to the availability of funding. Budgets should outline both general costs associated with development
of training and materials and specific costs for these services on a per-organization basis. 
_Interested organizations must submit a proposal to administer all components of this program. 
_Proposals under the facilitative assistance component of this program must demonstrate the organization's connections
to U.S. and NIS based organizations in support of people with disabilities.



Proposals should include a description of the process your organization would use to train organizations about the
need to integrate persons with disabilities in programs and the type of logistical education necessary to facilitate
integration.
The grantee organization should describe the process by which the information about accessible educational facilities
in the NIS will be gathered, organized and distributed. 
The grantee organizations should also demonstrate a plan for connecting US based organizations in support of disabled
persons and US organizations administering grant money for student exchange. In addition, the organization should
describe a culturally-sensitive plan for linking NIS organizations in support of persons with disabilities to secondary
school exchange organizations. 


Proposed Budget


Organizations must submit a comprehensive line item budget. Details are available in the application packet. Organizations
should be familiar with OMB circulars A110, A122, and A133 on cost accounting principles. 
Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The recipient must
maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the federal government. Such records are subject to audit.

The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB circular A110,
Attachment E. Cost sharing and Matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the organization does not
provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated in the recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will
be reduced in proportion to the participant's contribution. 



Review Process 



USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be
deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet.
Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will
also be reviewed by the appropriate geographic area office, and the budget and contracts office. Proposals may also
be reviewed by the Agency's Office of General Counsel. 

Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director of Educational and Cultural Affairs. 

Final technical authority to grant awards resides with the Agency's Office of Contracts. 



Review Criteria 



Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the following criteria: 



1. Quality of the Program Idea 



Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, rigor, and relevance to Agency mission and adherence to the criteria
and conditions described above and in application packet guidelines. 



2. Reasonable, Feasible, and Flexible Objectives 



Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution will meet the program's purposes as outlined in this RFP.




3. Multiplier Effect 



Proposals should demonstrate how the programs will encourage continuation of the training objectives beyond the
training period and beyond the training population.

All other items should be necessary and appropriate. 



5. Institutional Capacity and Track Record 



The organization should have demonstrated experience in the aspects of the program which they propose to administer.
Proposals benefit by displaying a record of successful programs, including responsible fiscal management and full
compliance with past Agency grants. 



6. Follow-Up Activities 



Proposals should present a plan to track the effectiveness of the training on following year exchange programs. 



7. Evaluation Plan 



Proposals should provide a plan for evaluation of the program by the grantee institution. 



Notice 



The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory
information provided by the Agency that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice advises the public that a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) is available for public review
and that public hearings will be held regarding this document. This proposal is for the development of a plan to manage
prairie dogs and livestock grazing on the Rosebud and Cheyenne River Reservations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:

 This DEIS includes two proposals, one for each reservation. The proposals are for developing grazing management
systems and for implementing varying levels of prairie dog poisoning on trust lands within the reservations. The
proposals are intended to maintain or improve range condition to appropriate levels to sustain reservation carrying
capacities for livestock grazing. This notice is required by the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Regulations (40 CFR part 1503) to obtain comments on the DEIS from agencies and the
public.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of the Interior, in 
cooperation with the Rosebud and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, has prepared a DEIS on the proposed management of prairie
dogs and livestock grazing on trust lands on the Rosebud and Cheyenne River Sioux Reservations. The alternatives
for each reservation include varying levels of prairie dog poisoning and grazing management systems. 
The purpose and need for these actions is to maintain or improve range condition to meet tribal objectives to sustain
reservation carrying capacities for livestock grazing and, therefore, increase tribal income. The Tribal Councils
feel that some grazing lands are degraded and many perceive that prairie dogs compete with livestock for forage, causing
economic losses to the tribes and tribal members. 
The preferred alternative (Alternative 3) for the Rosebud Reservation would implement extensive range improvements
and conduct chemical treatment of prairie dogs on all trust lands outside the 7,400-acre Corn Creek Management Area
(CCMA, located on the western boundary of the reservation). This alternative would meet tribal grazing objectives
and maintain the untreated CCMA for ecosystem biodiversity. Other alternatives considered were: continuing current
grazing management program with no prairie dog treatment; implementing extensive range improvements and treating
prairie dogs on all trust lands, with follow-up treatment for at least 90 percent control; and implementing extensive
range improvements and treating prairie dogs on all trust lands once, with follow-up treatments only on trust lands
outside the CCMA. 
The preferred alternative for the Cheyenne River Reservation is the Prairie Management Plan (Alternative 2) developed
by the Tribe in May 1992. The plan proposes extensive range improvements with prairie dog treatment conducted only
under limited circumstances, such as in cemeteries and on powwow grounds. This alternative would meet tribal grazing
objectives and maintain ecosystem biodiversity. Other alternatives considered were: continuing the current grazing
management program with no prairie dog treatment on trust lands; implementing extensive range improvements on trust
lands, conducting no prairie dog treatment within the 10,000 acre prairie dog complex along the Morcau River, conducting
prairie dog treatment on varying proportion of the remaining trust lands (25 percent treatment to 100 percent treatment);
and conducting treatment of prairie dogs on 50 percent of all trust lands, including those within the prairie dog complex
along the Morcau River. 
Agencies and individuals are urged to provide comments on this DEIS as soon as possible. All comments received by the
dates given above will be considered in preparation of the final EIS. Comments made at the public hearings will not
be considered comments on the DEIS unless they are submitted in writing. 
This notice is published pursuant to Sec. 1503.1 of the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts
1500 through 1508) implementing the procedural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as
amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); Department of the Interior Manual (516 DM 1-7); and the Bureau of Indian Affairs
guidelines (30 BIAM Supplements 1, 2, and 3.)

Notice of proposed priority.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Secretary proposes an absolute priority to focus fiscal year 1995 funds for new workplace literacy projects on
communities that have been designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities authorized under section
1391 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Under
the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved only for projects that provide workplace
literacy services to Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities through partnerships eligible for funding in
the National Workplace Literacy Program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background on Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Initiative



The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is a critical element of the Administration's community revitalization
strategy. The program is a first step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and rural
heartlands. It is designed to empower people and communities by inspiring Americans to work together to create jobs
and opportunity.

Under this program, the Federal Government will designate up to nine areas as Empowerment Zones and up to 95 areas as
Enterprise Communities in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 1391, as amended by title XIII of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66). To be eligible for designation, an areas must be nominated
by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located or by a State-Chartered Economic Development
Corporation. A nominated area must be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and must have
a poverty rate of not less than the level specified in section 1392 of the Internal Revenue Code.

In the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, communities are invited to submit strategic plans that
comprehensively address how the community would link economic development with education and training as well as
how community development, public safety, human services, and environmental initiatives will together support
sustainable communities. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be designated by the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) based on the quality of their strategic plans.
Designated areas will receive Federal grant funds and substantial tax benefits and will have access to other Federal
programs. (For additional information on the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program, contact HUD at
1-800-998-9999.)

The Department of Education is supporting the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative in a variety
of ways. It is encouraging Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities to use funds they already receive from Department
of Education programs (including Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education
Act) to support the comprehensive vision of their strategic plans. In addition, the Department of Education intends
to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in a number of discretionary grant programs
that are well suited for inclusion in a comprehensive approach to economic and community development. In addition
to the National Workplace Literacy Program described in this notice in which the Department intends to give an absolute
preference, the Department intends to give competitive preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities
in the Urban Community Service program, the Rehabilitation Act Projects with Industry program, Rehabilitation
Act Special Demonstration Projects program, the Parent Training program and Early Childhood Education program
under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, and a variety of discretionary programs under the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act. Notices concerning those programs will be published at a later date.



Background on National Workplace Literacy Program



The National Workplace Literacy Program is ideally suited to play a key role in the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise
Community program because it links economic development and education and training efforts. The program, which
makes discretionary grants of up to three years in length, supports demonstration projects that teach literacy skills
needed in the workplace through exemplary education partnerships. The partnerships are established between a business,
industry, or labor organization or a private industry council and an educational organization to support work-related
basic skills training. The National Workplace Literacy Program funds may be used, among other things, to update or
upgrade the skills of workers in line with changes in production processes or technology. For example, basic skill
levels that formerly were adequate for assembly line production are inadequate for employees faced with sophisticated
quality control systems, flexible production, team-based work, and participatory management practices.

National Workplace Literacy projects can improve the human resources of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities,
increase the productivity of businesses located in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, and help attract
new businesses to these needy areas. Further, an amendment to the program, contained in the National Literacy Act
of 1991, establishes a statutory priority for serving small businesses. This is the type of business most likely to
be found in the zones.

In addition, the National Workplace Literacy Program is an important vehicle for achieving the National Education
Goal that by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary
to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The program helps further
this goal by improving approaches and methods used in meeting the literacy needs of adults in the workplace, including
those with limited English proficiency. The National Workplace Literacy Program will also benefit by establishing
an absolute priority related to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Communities receiving these designations
will already have demonstrated a capacity for the type of cooperative planning that is critical to a successful workplace
literacy partnership. Projects funded under the priority will provide models for partnerships in other distressed
areas and show how the National Workplace Literacy Program furthers the National Education Goal that every adult
American will be literate and able to compete in the global economy.






Note:

 This notice of proposed priority does 

not

 solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition will be published in the 

Federal Register

 concurrent with or following publication of the notice of final priority.



Priority



Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that are otherwise
eligible for funding under the National Workplace Literacy Program and that meet the following priority. The Secretary
may implement this priority for fiscal year 1995 and for any later fiscal year:

Projects that provide workplace literacy services only for (a) persons who reside in and work in Empowerment Zones
and Enterprise Communities; (b) persons who work in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities although they
do not reside there; or (c) persons who reside in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities and who may work outside
the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. If necessary to the proper functioning of a project serving a substantial
number of persons in category (c), services may also be provided to a small number of their coworkers who neither work
nor reside in an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community.

<PARENT> FR940616-2-00101 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed project under the National Workplace Literacy Program must contribute to the strategic plan of the Empowerment
Zone or Enterprise Community and be made an integral component of the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community activities.

In providing workplace literacy services, partnerships must develop curricula related to work or use or modify curricula
developed by successful workplace literacy partnerships. For competitions under this absolute priority, the Secretary
will waive the selection criterion ``Evaluation Plan'' in 34 CFR 472.22(f) and the evaluation requirements in 34
CFR 472.31 and, in their place, conduct a national evaluation of projects serving Empowerment Zones and Enterprise
Communities. The purpose of the waiver is to allow Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community projects to focus maximum
resources on the provision of quality services and to further a Federal evaluation study that particularly can benefit
other distressed areas.



Additional Factor the Secretary Considers



After evaluating each application according to the proposed selection criteria, the Secretary may select for funding
one or more applications of high quality, other than the most highly rated applications, if the Secretary concludes
that this selection would improve the distribution of grants among applicants serving urban and rural areas.



Executive Order 12866



This notice of proposed priority has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the
order the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 

The potential costs associated with the notice of proposed priority are those resulting from statutory requirements
and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.


In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of this notice of proposed priority,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed priority justify the costs.

The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 

To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from this proposed priority without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.



Intergovernmental Review



This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective
of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on
processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance.

In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific
plans and actions for this program.



Invitation to Comment



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding this proposed priority.

All comments submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment
period, in room 4428, Switzer Building, 330 C Street, SW., Washington, DC, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.,

 Notice of funding availability (NOFA).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This NOFA announces the availability of up to $1.0 million of FY 1993 Fair Housing Initiatives Program funding for
a special project to be carried out in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. The purposes of this project, which
is part of the overall effort to reinvent the way the Department carries out its civil rights mission, are (1) to test
the effectiveness of a metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan and associated activities
to be administered by a central clearinghouse, especially in terms of generating increased housing choice and opportunity
for eligible assisted and insured housing applicants; (2) to determine the potential savings in administrative
costs for both housing providers and the Department if the clearinghouse concept were to be implemented permanently;
and (3) to determine whether eligible applicants for federally-assisted and/or insured private rental or sales
housing would be better served by the clearinghouse in terms of the support services performed during the mortgage
loan evaluation and rental application processes. 


In the body of this document is information concerning the purpose of the NOFA, eligibility, available amounts, selection
criteria, how to apply for funding, and how selections will be made.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


Application requirements associated with this program have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget,
under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)), and assigned OMB control number
2529-0033. 


I. Purpose and Substantive Description



(a) Authority 


(1) The Fair Housing Act



Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601-19 (Fair Housing Act), charges the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development with responsibility to accept and investigate complaints alleging discrimination
based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin in the sale, rental, advertising
or financing of housing. The Fair Housing Act also directs the Secretary to cooperate with State and local agencies
administering fair housing laws, and to cooperate with and render technical assistance to State, local and other
public or private entities carrying out programs to prevent and eliminate discriminatory housing practices. The
Act also directs the Secretary to administer the Department's housing and urban development programs in a manner
affirmatively to further the objectives of the Act.

In addition to the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing requirements described below, the Department has since 1971
attempted to translate the affirmatively furthering mandate through policy mechanisms such as the Site and Neighborhood
Standards, Tenant Selection and Assignment and Equal Housing Opportunity Plans, and other program and project-specific
strategies. In recent months the Department has recognized that these project and program-specific mechanisms
do not fully address the broad-based fair housing problems which actually exist. The Department has also identified
the problem of concentration of persons by race and income as a major barrier to the achievement of the objectives of
fair housing in the United States. The Department is in the process of formulating appropriate responses that will
be tested in the near future through special demonstration projects similar to this lab, including the feasibility
of implementing a metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan through a clearinghouse mechanism.



(2) The FHIP Program 


Section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, 42 U.S.C. 3616 note, established as a demonstration
program the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) to strengthen the Department's enforcement of the Fair Housing
Act and to further fair housing. This program assists projects and activities designed to enforce and enhance compliance
with the Fair Housing Act and substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. Implementing regulations
are found at 24 CFR part 125. 
Three general categories of activities were established at 24 CFR part 125 for FHIP funding under section 561 of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1987: The Administrative Enforcement Initiative, the Education and Outreach
Initiative, and the Private Enforcement Initiative. Section 905 of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), amended section 561 by adding specific eligible
applicants and activities to the Education and Outreach and Private Enforcement Initiatives, as well as an entirely
new Fair Housing Organization Initiative. Section 905 also gave the program permanent status. 
The regulations at 24 CFR part 125, subpart C, describe the purpose and eligible activities under the Education and
Outreach Initiative, the segment of the FHIP program under which the activity proposed in this NOFA is to be funded.
Section 125.303(b) describes eligible outreach projects that may be funded under this initiative, including but
not limited to the following: 
``(1) Developing national, regional and local media campaigns; 
(2) Bringing housing industry and civic or fair housing groups together to identify illegal real estate practices
and to determine how to correct them; 
(3) Designing specialized outreach projects to inform all persons of the availability of housing opportunities;

(4) Developing and implementing a response to new or more sophisticated housing practices that may result in discriminatory
housing practices; and 
(5) Developing mechanisms for the identification of and quick response to housing discrimination cases that involve
physical harm.'' 
The activities set forth in this NOFA are eligible activities under the Education and Outreach Initiative of the FHIP
program, since they relate to various eligible activities of this initiative. Other sections of this NOFA will specifically
illustrate how this relationship is facilitated. 


(3) Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Requirements


The Fair Housing Act states that it is the policy of the United States to provide, within constitutional limitations,
for fair housing throughout the United States. The Act also states at Section 808(e)(5) that the Department of Housing
and Urban Development shall administer its programs in a manner affirmatively to further the objectives of the Fair
Housing Act. Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing has, since 1972, been one of the means by which the Department has
carried out Section 808(e)(5) of the Act through the programs it has administered. The purpose of Affirmative Fair
Housing Marketing as stated in the regulations at 24 CFR 200.600, is to ``achieve a condition in which individuals
of similar income levels in the same housing market area have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless
of their race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status or national origin.'' These regulations also apply
to all applicants for participation in HUD insured subsidized or unsubsidized housing programs whose applications
are approved for: 
Multifamily projects and manufactured home parks of five or more lots, units or spaces, and initial submissions by
a lender for an application for mortgage insurance on a single family property, where the property is located in a subdivision
and the builder or developer intends to sell five or more properties in the subdivision;

1

 and dwelling units when the applicant's participation would exceed five or more HUD-insured single-family homes
within the preceding twelve-month period. Such participants are required to develop an affirmative marketing program
on a HUD-approved form. The regulations describe the specific components of an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing
Plan (AFHM) at 24 CFR 200.620.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940616-2-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940616-2-00102 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department reviews and evaluates these affirmative marketing plans submitted on Form HUD-935.2 (see attachment)
as part of an applicant's request for funding under a number of single-family and multifamily mortgage insurance
and subsidy programs. These reviews and evaluations, as well as the monitoring of the implementation of these Affirmative
Marketing Plans, are conducted under procedures outlined in HUD Handbook 8025.1 REV-2, Implementation of
Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Requirements. The Department also conducts compliance-related activities
under the regulations at 24 CFR Part 108, Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Compliance Regulations. 
A number of evaluations of both the administration of affirmative fair housing marketing and the underlying objectives
of the policy conducted since 1974 have raised questions about AFHM's effectiveness and results, especially in terms
of its effects on racial housing patterns within housing market areas. These evaluations and recent assessments
of how the review of Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing (AFHM) Plans fits into the overall workload of the Field Office
FHEO Divisions and Program Operations Divisions in the Regional Offices have also raised questions about the overall
cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the review process itself. The 1990 evaluation of AFHM performed by the Office
of Program Standards and Evaluation recommended that the Department pilot test the use of a third party to accept applications,
check references, and provide an applicant a list of all available housing opportunities under HUD-assisted and
insured single-family and multifamily programs. The evaluation also recommended that the Department conduct studies
of the manner in which various groups search for rental and sales housing and the costs and benefits of various marketing
techniques. The activities described in this NOFA address these recommendations in large part. 


(b) Allocation Amounts


For FY 1993, the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act, 1993 (approved October 6, 1992, Pub. L. 102-389), (93 Appropriations Act) appropriated $10.6 million
for the FHIP program. Of this amount, $1 million of Education and Outreach Initiative funds is made available under
this NOFA to carry out an affirmative fair housing marketing ``lab'' experiment. The balance of $9.6 million in FY
1993 funds was made available in a NOFA published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 68000) and amended on February 25, 1994
(59 FR 9235). 
The Department estimates that the affirmative fair housing marketing lab project will function approximately 18
months at a cost to the federal government not to exceed $1.0 million dollars. The final cost will depend upon submissions
from eligible applicants. In no case will the cost to the federal government for implementing the project under this
NOFA exceed $1.0 million dollars. The continuing operation of the clearinghouse following completion of the lab
will depend entirely on the income generated from fees and other funding sources. 


(c) Project Objectives


As a means of implementing the Department's strong commitment to administer its programs affirmatively to further
fair housing, the Department seeks to implement an affirmative fair housing marketing lab. This lab will test an areawide
affirmative marketing approach intended to expand affordable housing opportunities for those persons identified
as least likely to apply for the housing because of where it is located. The specific objectives of this lab are: 
(1) To promote greater awareness and acceptance on the part of housing providers and the entire community of the need
to market assisted housing on a nondiscriminatory basis throughout the metropolitan area to increase housing choice
and advance equal housing opportunity; 
(2) To develop a model for the use of metropolitan areawide affirmative marketing as an effective tool to affirmatively
further fair housing and provide greater affordable housing choice and opportunity throughout a metropolitan area;

(3) To determine whether use of a clearinghouse is an effective method over the long-term for assisted and insured
multifamily housing providers and builders and developers of HUD-insured single-family housing to carry out their
responsibilities under the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations; and 
(4) To test ways for metropolitan areawide affirmative marketing clearinghouses to become and remain financially
self-supporting. 


(d) Eligible Applicants


The following entities, either individually or in combination, are eligible to apply for funding under this NOFA:
Non-profit civil rights and housing organizations; organizations representing segments of the housing or mortgage
lending industries; higher education institutions with expertise in civil rights and housing. While location within
the Chicago metropolitan area would be highly desirable, it is not required.

(e) Project Components


HUD seeks to implement a fair housing marketing lab to examine new methods for offering privately operated federally
assisted and insured multifamily housing, within the Chicago metropolitan area to all eligible residents of the
area. For the purpose of this NOFA, the Chicago metropolitan area includes the City of Chicago and Cook, DuPage, Will,
Kane, McHenry and Lake Counties. This area was selected because of its extensive past experience in implementing
areawide interjurisdictional programs to promote fair housing and increased housing choice and because of the existing
infrastructure for carrying out such programs. It is hoped that a new approach to affirmative fair housing marketing
will result in a breakdown of jurisdictional barriers to housing opportunities and promote initiatives that diminish
residential segregation and encourage residential diversity. The $1 million offered through this NOFA will be targeted
toward affirmative fair housing marketing activities affecting either multifamily housing alone, single-family
housing alone, or both simultaneously. In addition, an applicant may focus its proposed activities on either the
entire metropolitan area or specific target areas which it may designate. 
The Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Lab involves three distinct elements: 
(1) The first element of the lab entails the establishment of a metropolitan areawide clearinghouse that will: 
(i) Develop and administer a metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan affecting participating
privately-owned federally assisted and insured multifamily housing. A complete description of this Plan is found
at Section IV (a)(2) of this NOFA. The plan would not include assisted housing owned by the public housing authorities
in the Chicago metropolitan area, since at this time the Department's Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations
do not apply to PHA-operated housing. Furthermore, the Department plans to conduct similar, larger-scale experiments
on metropolitan-wide strategies which will combine both privately-operated and PHA-operated housing. 
(ii) Develop and maintain the following databases: 
(A) A metropolitan areawide database of all families eligible for privately operated HUD-assisted (including insured)
multifamily housing who have used the services offered by the clearinghouse. The database would be compiled through
any of the following methods: 
(

1

) Encouraging families already on waiting lists of participating projects to take advantage of the housing opportunities
offered by the clearinghouse. Under this concept, the project manager would notify in writing all families on his
or her individual project waiting list of the existence of the clearinghouse and the availability of both the services
and the expanded housing choices it will offer. The notice would also say that any family which was found to be eligible
for any housing opportunity offered by the clearinghouse would not lose its position on the individual project's
waiting list and would in fact be ``crosslisted'' for all projects for which the family was eligible.






Note: 

A participant may opt to continue to maintain its own project waiting list while using the other application intake
services.

<TEXT>
 

(

2

) Recruiting families who respond to advertisements placed in various media as part of the proposer's metropolitan
areawide affirmative marketing plan; 
(B) An areawide list of housing opportunities offered by managers of participating multifamily projects subject
to AFHM requirements. These housing opportunities may be categorized by jurisdiction within the Chicago metropolitan
area, by neighborhood within the City of Chicago, by assisted or insured housing program, and by bedroom size; 
(C) The demographics of each development and the neighborhoods in which the assisted and insured housing opportunities
are located must be included and updated as turnover occurs. Information on the social services, transportation,
schools, churches, employment opportunities and other facets of the community must also be included. 
(iii) Carry out a major effort to secure voluntary participation in the clearinghouse by a significant number of housing
providers subject to AFHM requirements that do business within the area designated by the applicant. For purposes
of this NOFA, housing providers include corporations, individuals, or other entities who own and/or operate apartment
complexes of 10 or more units (including the Illinois Housing Development Authority which operates Section 8 Housing
projects subject to AFHM requirements), realty companies and home builders who build, rehabilitate or sell 10 or
more new single-family homes annually, and financial institutions involved in the making of loans on residential
property. This effort shall include outreach and education programs targeted at apartment managers, real estate
sales organizations and housing industry professionals, and shall describe the roles of the clearinghouse and the
providers in helping individual families take advantage of expanding affordable housing choices throughout the
Chicago metropolitan area. These outreach activities should be targeted especially toward those housing professionals
that do business outside of racially-impacted, ethnically-impacted and lower-income impacted neighborhoods
and are willing to attract applicants to those areas in which their race does not predominate. Such activities should
also be targeted to housing professionals who do business in predominantly minority areas and are willing to attempt
to attract non-minority applicants. 
The clearinghouse operator will have to explain the financial benefits and obligations of participating in the clearinghouse,
which can include the participants' being relieved of their AFHM and eligibility determination responsibilities.
To encourage participation by housing providers, HUD will waive the AFHM requirements and, as necessary to permit
participation, other regulatory and contractual requirements pertaining to tenant selection and assignment that
are not required by statute throughout the period of the lab. These waivers would affect those who would otherwise
be subject to the waived programmatic requirements (i.e., all persons approved for the development or rehabilitation
of single-family subdivisions, multifamily projects of 10 or more units, and all other persons subject to AFHM Plan
requirements in Departmental programs). This affirmative fair housing marketing lab will not alter in any way the
requirement for Public Housing Authorities to develop and submit an Equal Housing Opportunity Plan (EHOP) for Section
8 existing housing. 
(iv) Operate a one-stop metropolitan areawide housing center which shall perform the following services: 
(A) Processing applications for participating federally-assisted and/or insured privately-owned and operated
multifamily housing submitted by families who desire to investigate housing opportunities offered by participating
owners, managers and real estate brokers. While making applicants aware of all housing opportunities in the area
designated by the applicant, the office shall emphasize housing opportunities within areas in which the applicant
is least likely to apply for the housing without special outreach activities, because of where the housing is located,
and offer additional fair housing counseling for those persons desiring to relocate within such areas. The clearinghouse
shall also encourage the creation of housing opportunities within predominantly minority sections of the lab area,
so that applicants regardless of race or ethnicity may take advantage of them. The clearinghouse shall also make available
information on transportation, schools, social services, employment opportunities and other facets of living
in the area selected by the applicant.

<TEXT>
 

For all families that have not previously been on an assisted project's waiting list, the clearinghouse could review
for eligibility, perform income and employment verification, secure all information necessary to determine federal
or local preferences, and automatically crosslist the applicant for each type of housing project within the program
for which he or she is eligible. For example, if a family were to apply for a Section 221(d)(3) unit and were to be found
eligible under that program, the family would be crosslisted for all of that program's projects which were participating
in the clearinghouse. 
(B) Conduct testing and other related activities, particularly in the event that an applicant served by the clearinghouse
appears to have encountered discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap
or familial status or other prohibited conduct that may violate the Fair Housing Act or Executive Order 11063. However,
testing for enforcement purposes may be funded only from sources other than this NOFA, and the proposer shall indicate
clearly the purpose of any testing and the source and amount of funding devoted to this purpose. Testing, if carried
out for educational purposes only, may be funded through this NOFA. 
(C) Provide escort and other services to families willing to explore housing opportunities in neighborhoods where
their race or ethnic group does not predominate and where they would have been least likely to apply without special
outreach. 
(v) The applicant can also propose any of the following activities affecting FHA-insured, VA or conventionally financed
single-family housing which is affordable for low-income families. These activities may be funded either exclusively
from this NOFA, exclusively from sources other than this NOFA or from both federal and non-federal sources: 
(A) An areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan which emphasizes the single-family market; 
(B) An areawide list of single-family homeownership opportunities generated from financial institutions, realty
companies and local governments. These entities may refer prospective home purchasers to the clearinghouse upon
request, so that such purchasers can avail themselves of the homeownership opportunities listed by the clearinghouse;
and 
(C) A campaign that targets: (

1

) Realty companies and home builders who build, rehabilitate or sell 10 or more new single-family homes annually,
and 
(

) financial institutions involved in the making of loans on residential property through the outreach program to
housing providers contained in the proposed areawide affirmative marketing plan. 
(2) The second element of the lab consists of an evaluation of the clearinghouse concept. The evaluation shall address:

(i) How the clearinghouse concept compares with the present system of HUD review of individual affirmative marketing
plans and with the participation by local affiliates of the National Association of Realtors, the National Association
of Homebuilders, the National Association of Real Estate Brokers and several other major national real estate industry
organizations in the Voluntary Affirmative Marketing Agreement Program, in terms of cost-effectiveness; and 
(ii) How effective the clearinghouse is in creating greater housing choice and opportunity and in affecting change
in a community's housing occupancy and homeownership patterns. 
The Department has decided that the evaluation of the activities conducted under this NOFA will be conducted by an
independent contractor prior to the end of the project. 
(3) The third element of the lab requires the development of new ways to: 
(i) Identify groups within the eligible population that are less likely to apply for housing without special outreach;

(ii) Encourage those groups to take advantage of housing opportunities in nontraditional areas; 
(iii) Identify effective advertising methods; 
(iv) Increase awareness of nondiscriminatory tenant selection and application processing; and 
(v) Test other ways to implement affirmative fair housing marketing. 


(f) Selection Criteria/Ranking Factors 


(1) Selection Criteria for Ranking Applications for Assistance


All proposals submitted in response to this NOFA will be ranked on the basis of the following selection criteria: 
(i) 

The anticipated impact of the proposal on the concerns identified in the application.

 (25 points). In determining the anticipated impact of each proposal, HUD will evaluate whether the proposal is well-conceived
and likely to be successful if implemented, and will consider the degree to which the proposal addresses the significant
fair housing issues affecting the Chicago metropolitan area which had been identified in the fair housing analysis
required under this NOFA. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the proposer describes the potential impact of
the proposed plan on the fair housing environment. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions
in response to Paragraphs IV (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(6) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission
Requirements''. 
(ii) 

The extent to which the proposal will provide benefits in support of fair housing after the lab has been completed.

 (25 points) In determining the extent to which the proposal will continue providing benefits after funded activities
have been completed, HUD will consider the degree to which the concept can be used as a model for similar metropolitan
areawide affirmative marketing clearinghouses in other parts of the country. HUD will also evaluate how the applicant
plans to insure the long-term financial viability of the clearinghouse fundraising from public and private sources
or other means. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's submissions in response to Paragraphs
IV (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(5), and (a)(8) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements''.

(iii) 

The extent to which the project will provide the maximum benefits in a cost-effective manner

 (20 points). In determining the extent to which the proposal will provide the maximum benefit for the metropolitan
area covered by this NOFA in a cost-effective manner, HUD will consider the quality and reasonableness of the proposed
statement of work, and the timeline and budget for implementation and completion of the lab. 

HUD will consider as well the adequacy and clarity of proposed procedures to be used by the proposer for monitoring
the progress of the lab and ensuring its timely completion. These procedures may consist of a system for checking whether
or not the milestones established are being met.

The applicant's capability in handling financial resources (e.g., adequate financial control and accounting procedures)
demonstrated through previous project management experience will be taken into account as part of the assessment.
HUD will also consider the degree to which the applicant proposes to use funds for program costs as opposed to administrative
costs. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the proposer's submissions in response to Paragraphs IV(a)(3),
(a)(5) and (a)(7) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements''.

(iv) The 

extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience will further the achievement of the
proposal's goals

 (20 points). In determining the extent to which the applicant's professional and organizational experience are
likely to further the achievement of the proposal's goals, HUD will consider the applicant's experience in formulating
and carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory practices, including the applicant's management
of past or current projects, including projects that have addressed the problem of providing housing on a nondiscriminatory
basis to minorities, women, the disabled and other protected classes.

HUD will also consider these qualifications in the context of the applicant's overall knowledge of the fair housing
environment in the Chicago metropolitan area. It will also consider the experience and qualifications of existing
personnel identified for key positions, or a description of the qualifications of new staff that will be hired, including
subcontractors and consultants. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the proposer's submissions in response
to Paragraph IV(a)(3) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements''.

(v) 

The extent to which the project will utilize other public or private resources that may be available

 (10 points). The applicant shall describe whether in addition to the $1.0 million provided by this NOFA it plans to
use other public or private resources. The other resources must be clearly and specifically targeted for this project
and must be over and above the resources available to the applicant as part of its present, non-project operations
for such expenses as salaries, equipment, supplies and rent. This criterion will be judged on the basis of the applicant's
response to Paragraph IV (a)(4) of this NOFA under the heading ``Checklist of Application Submission Requirements''.

(vi) 

Minority Business Enterprise/Women-Owned Business Enterprise

 (5 points). The applicant shall also describe its experience in Minority Business Enterprise/Women-Owned Business
Enterprise contracting. The applicant shall provide a summary of the total amount awarded in each of the two categories
for the previous three years and the percentage that amount represents of the total contracts awarded by the applicant
in the relevant time period.

(2) Selection Process. Each application for funding will be evaluated competitively and awarded points based on
the General Selection Criteria identified in the previous section. The final decision rests with the Assistant Secretary
or her designee. After eligible applications are evaluated against the factors for award and assigned a score, they
will be organized by rank order.

(3) Cost factors. The Department expects to fund one proposal as a result of this NOFA. It is possible, however, that
two or more complete and eligible applications, after evaluation against the Selection Criteria, may be considered
equal in technical merit. Should that occur, their relative evaluated cost will become the deciding factor. Furthermore,
an applicant's proposal will not be funded whose costs are determined to be unrealistically low or unreasonably high.



(f) Applicant Notification and Award Procedures



(1) Notification 



No information will be available to applicants during the period of HUD evaluation, except for notification in writing
to those applicants that are determined to be ineligible or that have technical deficiencies in their applications
that may be corrected. The Selectee will be announced by HUD upon completion of the evaluation process, subject to
final negotiations and award.



(2) Negotiations 



After HUD has ranked the applications and made an initial determination of applicants whose scores are within the
funding range (but before the actual award), HUD may require that applicants in this group participate in negotiations
to determine the specific terms of the grant agreement. In cases where it is not possible to conclude the necessary
negotiations successfully, awards will not be made. If an award is not made to an applicant whose application is in
the initial funding ranking because of an inability to complete successful negotiations, and if funds are available
to fund any applications that may have fallen outside the initial funding ranking, HUD will select the next highest
ranking applicant and proceed as described in the preceding paragraph.



(3) Funding Instrument 



HUD expects to award a cost reimbursable or fixed-price cooperative agreement to the successful applicant. HUD reserves
the right, however, to use the form of assistance agreement determined to be appropriate after negotiations with
the applicant.

(4) Reduction of Requested Grant Amounts and Special Conditions 



HUD may approve an application for an amount lower than the amount requested, withhold funds after approval, and/or
the grantee will be required to comply with special conditions added to the grant agreement, in accordance with 24
CFR 85.12, the requirements of this NOFA, or where: 

(i) HUD determines the amount requested for one or more of the components of the proposal is unreasonable or unnecessary.


(ii) The applicant has demonstrated an inability to manage HUD grants;

(iii) For any other reason where good cause exists.



(5) Performance Sanctions 



A recipient failing to comply with the procedures set forth in its grant agreement will be liable for such sanctions
as may be authorized by law, including repayment of improperly used funds, termination of further participation
in FHIP, and denial of further participation in programs of the Department or of any federal agency.



III. Application Process 



An application kit is required as the formal submission to apply for funding. The kit includes information on the Statement
of Work and Budget for activities proposed by the applicant. An application may be obtained by writing the Fair Housing
Information Clearinghouse, Post Office Box 6091, Rockville, MD 20850, or by calling the toll-free number 1-800-343-3442.
To ensure a prompt response, it is suggested that requests for application kits be made by telephone.

Completed applications are to be submitted to Laurence D. Pearl, Director, Office of Program Standards and Evaluation,
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 5224, 451 Seventh
Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. The application due date and time will be specified in the application kit. In no
event, however, will the application be due before August 15, 1994. The application deadline is firm as to date and
hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration
any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants should take this practice into account and make early
submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other
delivery-related problems. A transmission by facsimile machine (``FAX'') will not constitute delivery.



IV. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements



(a) General Requirements 

The application kit will contain a checklist of application submission requirements to complete the application
process. Each proposal submitted under this NOFA must contain the following items:

(1) A metropolitan areawide analysis of the impediments to fair housing choice faced by individual homeseekers within
the Chicago metropolitan area, taking into account any of the institutional problems involving the major segments
of the real estate and lending industries. This analysis must include a discussion of the problems which specifically
relate to the marketing of single-family and multifamily housing to all segments of the population, with particular
emphasis on marketing to persons considered protected under the Fair Housing Act and other statutes. The analysis
must also discuss the connections between the effectiveness of marketing and the processes of selecting tenants
for multifamily projects and evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants for home mortgages. The analysis must
also address how its proposed clearinghouse concept will (i) address any and all impediments identified, (ii) help
effect change in the current racial and income related housing patterns within the Chicago metropolitan area affected
by this NOFA, and (iii) help increase the awareness of all participants in the housing process, especially participants
from the real estate industry, of their obligations under fair housing statutes.

(2) A metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan with the following components:

(i) A description of an overall advertising campaign targeted toward groups identified as least likely to apply for
assisted housing located within areas for reasons such as the race or national origin of the persons in the area, the
lack of units that are accessible to physically disabled persons in the area and the absence of significant numbers
of families with children in the area. The campaign may be organized to reach the entire area affected by this NOFA or
may be segmented to reach particular jurisdictions, sections within individual jurisdictions or particular segments
of the eligible population. The plan shall describe the media to be used, including minority media, community organizations
and contacts, referral services that assist disabled persons, and other tactics. The objective of this part of the
plan is to encourage prospective renters and home purchasers to use the services of the clearinghouse in their housing
searches, especially those services that will support their searches within non-traditional areas.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) A campaign to involve the various provider communities in the clearinghouse on a voluntary basis, 

e.g.

, assisted multifamily housing managers, local boards of realtors, home builders associations and individual home
builders. The plan shall describe the methods to be used to recruit within the provider community, and how it plans
to describe the incentives and obligations (both financial and otherwise) for participation in the clearinghouse.
All such financial and other incentives and obligations shall be reviewed and approved by the Department prior to
the implementation of this lab. The plan shall also describe any and all training programs to be presented to clearinghouse
participants on their obligations under federal, state and local fair housing laws.

(iii) A fair housing counseling program to be given all prospective renters and homebuyers who use the clearinghouse's
services to search for dwellings located within areas in which their race or ethnic group does not predominate and
in areas where they would be otherwise least likely to apply for housing without special outreach activities due to
factors pertaining to the racial or ethnic composition of the neighborhood.

(iv) A goals statement on ensuring increased housing choice and causing deconcentration by race and income in different
sections of the community. These goals may be stated in terms of achieving socio-economic changes, 

e.g.

, in the racial/ethnic composition of particular neighborhoods or projects, or of getting individual homeseekers
to feel that their housing options were increased by availing themselves of the services offered by the clearinghouse.
The goals can also be stated in terms of bringing about changes in the attitudes and practices of financial institutions,
real estate offices, apartment management companies and other entities that make decisions about their customers'
housing choices.

(v) Description of the structure of a consolidated areawide database for multifamily housing units offered by the
clearinghouse's fair housing center. This database can be generated from applicants who avail themselves of the
services offered by the fair housing center after it opens, or from the waiting lists maintained by the individual
participating private owners or management companies prior to the center's opening. The proposer shall also describe
the mechanics of actual tenant selection, 

e.g.

, selection by the fair housing center staff or by the individual apartment management company or landlord; the procedures
to be used by the clearinghouse in processing applications from individual apartment seekers and the arrangements
to be made with participating multifamily project managers with respect to referrals from the clearinghouse and
the actual selection of tenants;

(vi) Descriptions of activities appropriate to the single-family market, to be included by applicants who wish to
emphasize marketing to the prospective home purchaser. Such activities may include:

(A) Testing appropriate methods of involving local financial institutions under the aegis of the fair housing center
in activities which will increase the sensitivity and awareness of such institutions and their professional staff
about the impact of their lending and mortgage credit review practices upon properties and individuals located in
lower-income and racially and ethnically impacted neighborhoods;

(B) Testing new methods of marketing to nontraditional home purchasers, 

e.g.

, low-income families, persons with disabilities, and first-time home purchasers who desire to increase their knowledge
of the responsibilities of homeownership;

(C) Testing a clearinghouse system geared toward referring prospective home purchasers to real estate professionals
who will assist them in navigating the home purchase process.

(3) A statement of work, a budget_which must include a realistic amount, not to exceed $2,000, in travel costs for financial
management training sponsored by the Department_and a timeline for the implementation of the proposed activities,
consisting of a description of the specific activities to be conducted with these funds, the geographic areas to be
served by the activities, the cost of each proposed activity and a schedule for the implementation and completion
of the activities.

(4) A description of the applicant's experience in formulating or carrying out programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory
housing practices or in implementing other civil rights programs, the experience and qualifications of existing
personnel identified for key positions, or a description of the qualifications of new staff to be hired, including
subcontractors/consultants.

(5) A description of the financial mechanisms to be used by the clearinghouse operator in addition to the federal funds
to make the clearinghouse self-sustaining. Such a mechanism shall be reviewed and approved by the Department prior
to the implementation of this lab.

(6) A description of the procedures to be used by the applicant for monitoring the progress of the proposed activities.

(7) A description of the fair housing benefits that successful completion of the project will produce, and the indicators
by which these benefits are to be measured. These possible benefits can include changes in racial, ethnic and income-related
housing patterns that may have taken place during the testing period, increases in awareness and changes in lending,
or sales and rental practices which result in fairer treatment for persons protected by civil rights statutes. Particular
emphasis must be placed on measuring and comparing the costs and the benefits of the present system of HUD AFHM Plan
processing and the clearinghouse concept being tested under this NOFA.

(8) A description of how the clearinghouse will be of continuing use in dealing with housing discrimination after
the completion of the demonstration. In this section, the proposer shall explain how the clearinghouse plans to continue
its existence after the expiration of this grant, describing the public and private sources of financing and the services
which are both similar to and different from the services to be offered during the period of this grant.

(9) HUD Form 2880, Applicant Disclosures.

(10) The applicant must submit a certification and disclosure in accordance with the requirements of section 319
of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101-121, approved October 23, 1989), as implemented
in HUD's interim final rule at 24 CFR part 87, published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 26, 1990 (55 FR 6736). This statute generally prohibits recipients and subrecipients of federal contracts,
grants, cooperative agreements and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive and Legislative
Branches of the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. If warranted, the applicant
should include the Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form (SF-LLL).



V. Corrections to Deficient Applications



Applicants will not be disqualified from being considered for funding because of technical deficiencies in their
application submission, e.g., an omission of information such as regulatory/program certifications, inadequate
budget data, or incomplete signatory requirements for application submission.

HUD will notify an applicant in writing of any technical deficiencies in the application. The applicant must submit
corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency.

The 14-day correction period pertains only to non-substantive, technical deficiencies or errors. Technical deficiencies
relate to items that:

(a) Are not necessary for HUD review under selection criteria/ranking factors; and

(b) Would not improve the substantive quality of the proposal.

VI. Other Matters 


Section 504 Requirements


Recipients will be expected to comply with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.
794, and 24 CFR part 8. Section 504 prohibits discrimination based on handicap in federally assisted programs. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying


On February 26, 1990, at 55 FR 6736, the Department joined in the issuance of a government-wide interim rule advising
recipients and subrecipients of federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans exceeding $100,000
of a new prohibition against use of appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the federal
government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. In general, this rule prohibits the awarding of
contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. In addition, the recipient must file a disclosure if it has made or has agreed to make any payment
with nonappropriated funds that would be prohibited if paid with appropriated funds. The law provides substantial
monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure. 


Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's
regulations at 24 CFR part 50 which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42
U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public
