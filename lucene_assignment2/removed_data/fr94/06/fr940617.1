OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT








Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance and Federal Employees Health Benefits Programs; Reconsideration of Employing
Office Enrollment Decisions


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed regulations with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In keeping with the Administration's initiative to reinvent Government, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
is issuing proposed regulations to improve the administrative process used by the Federal Employees' Group Life
Insurance (FEGLI) and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) programs in resolving disputes between Federal
employees and agencies over coverage and enrollment issues. The purpose of the proposed regulations is to improve
the performance of the Government by delegating to Federal agencies the authority to reconsider disputes over coverage
and enrollment issues in these two programs and to make retroactive as well as prospective corrections of errors.
The proposed regulations would result in more efficient Government operations and improved service to individuals
seeking benefits under the programs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the FEGLI law, eligible employees are automatically insured under Basic Life insurance (generally equal to
their annual pay, rounded to the next thousand, plus $2,000), unless they waive coverage. In addition, employees
with Basic Life coverage may elect coverage under one or more of the 3 types of optional insurance available. (Standard
Optional offers an additional $10,000 of insurance. Additional Optional offers insurance in an amount of one, two,
three, four, or five times annual pay rounded to the next thousand. Family Optional offers $5,000 insurance for the
spouse and $2,500 for each child.) OPM's regulations prescribe the circumstances under which employees cancel waivers
of Basic Life, elect optional coverage, increase optional coverage, or drop coverage.


Under the FEHB Program, eligible employees may enroll in FEHB when they are first hired. They may enroll or change enrollment
during open season, when their family status changes, or at other times prescribed by OPM's regulations. The FEHB
law also provides for enrollment by certain former employees, former spouses, and children when they lose regular
FEHB coverage because of separation from service or loss of family member status. The specific conditions of their
enrollment and opportunities to change enrollment are controlled by OPM's regulations.

Employees (and family members who are eligible to enroll in FEHB) make changes in their life insurance coverage and
health benefits enrollment through the employee's personnel office. These administrative actions are normally
conducted entirely between the agency and the individual, based on FEGLI and FEHB law and regulations. However, occasions
arise when individuals challenge the agency's denial of their request for coverage, to change their FEHB enrollment
or FEGLI coverage, or to change their FEGB enrollment or FEGLI optional coverage retroactively. (Because Basic Life
insurance coverage is mandatory under FEGLI law unless the employee waives it, an agency that erroneously denies
Basic Life to an employee must restore it retroactively when the error is discovered.) Under OPM's regulations, elections
of optional life insurance coverage and FEHB enrollment or enrollment changes are generally effective prospectively
unless a specific statutory or regulatory provision requires or allows the agency to make a retroactive change. Errors
that consist of allowing an employee to elect life insurance coverage under circumstances not prescribed by law or
regulation are corrected retroactively, including errors that are not discovered until after the death of an insured
employee.) The current process used to resolve disputes between individuals and agencies over coverage or enrollment
determinations is described in 5 CFR   870.205, 871.206, 872.206, 873.206, 874.305, and 890.104. 

Under these current procedures, employees, children, or former spouses who are denied coverage or enrollment, the
opportunity to change coverage or enrollment, or, in most cases, to have a change made retroactively by a Federal agency
must write to the Office of Personnel Management within 30 days after the agency's written denial if they believe the
agency's decision was incorrect and want to have it reviewed. OPM reviews the agency's denial to determine if it complies
with the applicable law and regulations. Since agencies currently do not have the regulatory authority to make retroactive
changes in most cases, they must deny most such requests. Therefore, most requests for a retroactive change must come
to OPM for review before the retroactive change can be made. (Basic life insurance is an exception. Under the FEGLI
law, employees are automatically covered for Basic Life insurance; therefore, agencies must correct failures to
withhold retroactively.) In addition, OPM has the authority, by regulation, to order corrections of errors, mistakes,
or omissions based on its determination that it would be against equity and good conscience not to do so. 

In 1992, OPM received 283 requests for reconsideration and upheld the agency's decision in 39 percent of the cases.
OPM overturned 38 percent of agency decisions and returned 23 percent to the agency because the individual failed
to follow proper administrative procedures. As of August 30, 1993, there has been a 50 percent increase in requests
for reconsideration over the 1992 figures. 

In many of these cases, the issue was (or included) a request that the coverage or change in coverage be made retroactive
to some earlier date. Out of 94 requests from employees involving retroactive coverage, we allowed 70 and denied 24.
Although an agency has all the necessary information at its disposal and knows whether a retroactive correction is
appropriate, it lacks the authority under current regulations to make corrections retroactively. It can accept
the employee's request to enroll or change enrollment, but only on a prospective basis. The agency must deny the employee's
request for a retroactive change. Therefore, the employees write to OPM to have the decision reviewed. If appropriate,
OPM can then order the agency to make the retroactive correction. 

As part of OPM's ongoing efforts to improve efficiency, and in keeping with the Administration's initiative to streamline
Government operations, OPM is issuing proposed regulations that would delegate to Federal agencies the authority
to correct coverage and enrollment errors retroactively. In addition, the proposed regulations would transfer
the reconsideration (review) process for the FEGLI and FEHB programs from OPM to the agencies. Under the proposed
regulations, Federal agencies (or retirement systems, if applicable) would make the initial decisions at the employing
office level and would provide for reconsideration at a higher, or otherwise independent, level of review. The reconsideration
could, at each agency's discretion, be made at a higher level within the employing office or at the same level elsewhere
in the agency. The proposed regulations set forth only the most basic elements necessary to meet due process requirements.
For the most part, agencies would be free to use existing administrative review procedures that include these basic
elements or to create administrative procedures specific to this purpose. The agency's decision based on its reconsideration
of the initial decision would be final. (FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection
Board.) 

Current regulations regarding employee withholdings and Government contributions would continue to apply. That
is, when agencies make retroactive changes, the agency must pay into the respective trust fund an amount equal to any
withholdings and contributions due from the effective date of the change. The agency may collect the amount of the
withholdings due from the employee or may waive collection under existing law and regulations. 

With the authority to make retroactive changes conferred by the proposed regulations, the agencies could correct
errors promptly, review initial decisions on request, and give the individual a thorough, written explanation of
the final decision. Thus, we believe that the Government would operate more efficiently and employees, their children,
and their former spouses would be better served under these regulations. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it merely amends administrative procedures currently performed by OPM and Federal agencies.

Amendment to Egg Research and Promotion Order To Increase the Rate of Assessment



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed Rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would amend the Egg Research and Promotion Order to increase the assessment rate from 5 cents to
10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. The increase is authorized by amendments to the Egg Research and Consumer
Information Act must be approved by egg producers voting in a referendum. This proposal would also make a conforming
amendment to regulations.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Orders 12866 and 12778



This rule has been determined not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and has been reviewed by the
Office of Management and Budget.

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
14 of the Act, a person subject to an order may file a petition with the Secretary stating that such order, any provisions
of such order or any obligations imposed in connection with such order are not in accordance with law; and requesting
a modification of the order or an exemption therefrom. Such person is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the
petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the
United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, has jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint is filed within 20 days after date of the entry of the
ruling.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.
601 

et seq.

).

Currently, 618 egg producers pay assessments to the American Egg Board (AEB). A proposed rule to increase the exemption
level from 30,000 to 75,000 laying hens was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13460). The increased exemption level would exempt 253 small egg producers who represent 41
percent of the egg producers currently paying assessments, but only 4 percent of AEB's total assessment income. It
is anticipated that the 75,000-hen exemption level would be in place before the referendum on the assessment rate
increase. Therefore, a change in the assessment rate would affect only egg producers owning more than 75,000 laying
hens.

There are an estimated 365 producers who own more than 75,000 hens. Currently, egg producers must pay a mandatory assessment
of 5 cents per 30-dozen case of eggs marketed to fund the research and promotion activities authorized by the Act. The
present 5-cent assessment is equivalent to approximately 0.231 percent of the wholesale price of a 1-dozen carton
of Large eggs. An assessment rate of 10 cents per 30-dozen case would be equivalent to approximately 0.463 percent
of the wholesale price of a
1-dozen carton of Large eggs. This is based on the Economic Research Service's 3-year average wholesale price for
New York City Grade A Large cartoned eggs (1991-93) of 72 cents per dozen. AEB collects approximately $7.5 million
annually from the 5-cent assessment, and it is estimated that it would collect $14 million for a 10-cent assessment.
It is estimated that any additional costs would be offset by the benefits to be derived from strengthened research
and promotion programs.



Paperwork Reduction



Information collection requirements and recordkeeping provisions contained in 7 CFR Part 1250 have been previously
approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581-0093 under the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980.

No additional recordkeeping requirements would be imposed as a result of this proposed rule.



Background and Proposed Changes



On December 14, 1993, the Egg Research and Consumer Information Act (7 U.S.C. 2711) was amended (Pub. L. 103-188)
to increase the maximum rate of assessment, raise the exemption level, and provide for research project funding.

<TEXT>
 

Under the amended section 8 of the Act, the maximum rate of assessment was raised from 10 cents to 20 cents per case of
commercial eggs. The actual assessment rate is prescribed by the Egg Research and Promotion Order and is currently
5 cents per case. Producers owning 30,000 or fewer laying hens are exempt from paying assessments and other provisions
of the Act. Section 12 of the Act was amended to increase the exemption level to 75,000 or fewer hens. A proposed rule
to raise the exemption level in the Order was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 22, 1994. The new exemption level will become effective after publication of the final rule.

The Act amendments provide that AEB may recommend an increase in the assessment rate to the Secretary. The recommendation
must be based on a scientific study, marketing analysis, or other evidence demonstrating a need for the increase.
Consequently, AEB conducted a marketing analysis and evaluated the advertising and nutrition research programs.



Advertising



AEB began its first advertising campaign in 1977. For the next 3 years, media expenditures averaged $3.5 million annually.
In 1980, the American Association of Advertising Agencies noted that, during that 3-year period, per capita consumption
of eggs had increased and consumer attitudes toward eggs had improved.

Considering inflation, an estimated $9 million would be required for AEB to conduct a media program in 1994 comparable
to that in 1977. Further, because consumers have grown more concerned with a variety of issues affecting egg consumption,
an even greater level of funding would be needed to achieve the same results today.

AEB's analysis establishes that egg consumption has been steadily declining over many years. In fact, USDA statistics
show that per capita consumption dropped from 402 in 1945 to 234 in 1993. In general, the decline is attributed to fewer
egg-consuming households and less frequent egg consumption.

Eggs face certain barriers in the marketplace which have contributed to the declining consumption. Considered by
consumers to be primarily a breakfast food, eggs must compete with a variety of breakfast alternatives: cold cereal;
pancakes and waffles; rolls, muffins, and toast; and hot cereal. The total measured media spending for the breakfast
food category was $937 million in 1993. Egg industry advertising-including that funded by AEB, State and regional
associations, and companies promoting name brands-represents only 0.7 percent of that amount.

In addition, consumer concerns with fat and cholesterol have significantly affected consumer eating habits. The
judgment that eggs are high in cholesterol has further contributed to consumers using fewer eggs. Overcoming 
negative consumer attitudes is even more difficult when other breakfast foods are more heavily promoted.

AEB's current advertising strategy is three-fold: (1) Educate consumers about eggs and cholesterol by providing
facts on egg cholesterol in a healthy diet; (2) remind consumers how much they love the great taste of eggs; and (3) connect
eggs with the rich, pleasurable associations people have with eggs and egg-eating occasions.

The current ``I Love Eggs'' advertising campaign based on this strategy proved effective in consumer testing. Prior
to being exposed to the advertising, 43 percent of consumers tested had extremely positive or very positive attitudes
about eggs. This number increased by 13 percent after consumers were exposed to the advertising. Further, almost
half of the consumers tested reported an increased likelihood of eating and serving eggs more often.

With current funding, AEB has earmarked about $2.8 million for this campaign in 1995. This budget supports 15-second
television commercials and 30-second radio spots. A 5-cent increase in the assessment rate would allow for an advertising
budget of $7.5 million. This budget would enable the use of more effective 30-second television spots; allow advertising
to be aired almost every other week, as opposed to the 10 weeks per year now; and provide for over 1,000 additional commercial
announcements. Most significantly, an additional one million target households would be reached by AEB advertising
each week.



Nutrition Research



The nutrition portion of AEB's budget encompasses two programs of importance both for the egg industry and the consuming
public-nutrition research and nutrition education.

In recent years, an increased amount of the AEB budget has been used for research to evaluate the effects of dietary
cholesterol on plasma lipids. Since 1991, $1.3 million has funded research projects at various universities, all
of which have focused on this issue. For example, a recently completed study was published in the April issue of the
American Heart Association's ``Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis'' journal. The results of this study found that
blood cholesterol levels in young healthy men did not significantly increase when they were fed 1 or 2 eggs per day.
Additional funding would allow the egg industry to study the same effects across other population groups.

Increased funding also would allow AEB to expand its contacts with scientists, health professionals, and the media
in developing nutrition materials, sponsoring scientific symposiums and related forums, and compiling research
data.

AEB Recommendation



At the March 17, 1994, Board meeting in Chicago, Illinois, AEB members voted unanimously to recommend that the assessment
rate be increased from 5 cents to 10 cents per 30-dozen case of commercial eggs. Their decision was based on the marketing
analysis as well as an overall sense from producers nationwide that more funds are necessary to help improve the position
of the industry's products in the marketplace through strengthened advertising and research programs. AEB further
requested that a referendum on this increase be held as soon as possible. 



Referendum



After an opportunity for public comment, a referendum will be held among egg producers not exempt from the Act. Producers
engaged in the production of commercial eggs during a representative period determined by the Secretary 
will be eligible to vote on the assessment rate change proposed by AEB.

All known eligible egg producers will receive information in the mail regarding the referendum. It is anticipated
that the 75,000-hen exemption level will be in place before the referendum.

The increase in the assessment rate shall become effective if the change is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds
of the producers voting in the referendum, or a majority of such producers if they represent not less than two-thirds
of the commercial eggs produced by those voting.

Statement of General Policy or Interpretation; Commentary on the Fair Credit Reporting Act



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed amendment to commentary.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission is seeking public comment on a proposed amendment to its Commentary on the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(``FCRA''), 16 CFR Part 600. The proposed amendment clarifies the Commission's interpretation that the FCRA requires
the disclosure of ``risk scores'' to consumers by consumer reporting agencies. This action responds to widespread
interest in this issue, and various inquiries the Commission and its staff have received about it.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background




During the late 1980s, the credit reporting industry developed a product, called the ``risk score,'' to evaluate
a consumer's credit history for its clients. A risk score assesses the likelihood of a particular adverse event, such
as default or bankruptcy, based on various factors in a consumer report. The result of this evaluation is communicated
by means of a numerical score.

Section 609 of the FCRA requires a consumer reporting agency, upon receiving a request and proper identification
from a consumer, to ``clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer . . . [t]he nature and substance
of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.'' A consumer
reporting agency also must disclose, in most instances, the sources of the information in the consumer's file, as
well as the recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which the reporting agency has furnished six months preceding
the consumer's request (or two years, if the report is for employment purposes).

On February 11, 1992, the Commission amended its FCRA Commentary to state that, pursuant to section 609 of the FCRA,
``a risk score (or other numerical evaluation, however named) that is reported by a consumer reporting agency to a
client to assist in evaluating a consumer's eligibility for credit (or other permissible purposes) must be disclosed
(along with an explanation of the risk score)'' to a consumer requesting disclosure of his or her credit file from the
consumer reporting agency. 57 FR 4935-36 (Feb. 11, 1992). It noted that Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, when
introducing the conference report on the bill that ultimately enacted the FCRA, had stated:




(The House conferees) stressed that the consumer should have access to all information 

in any form which would be relayed to a prospective employer, insurer or creditor in making a judgment as to the worthiness
of the individual's application for such benefits.* * * It is not intended that the credit reporting
firm should have a free hand in excluding from the consumer's access information other than medical information it
just does not want to give him, but will give to a client-user.





116 Cong Rec. 36572 (October 12, 1970) (emphasis added)



After the Commission amended the FCRA Commentary, several industry representatives requested clarification of
the revision. As part of this process, some of these parties (as well as consumer representatives and other interested
parties) submitted informal statements of their positions that appear on the Commission's public record. Commissioners
and Bureau of Consumer Protection staff have discussed these issues with industry, consumer and state representatives.
During these discussions, the following three principal issues arose concerning the applicability of the FCRA to
risk scores: (1) When a consumer reporting agency must disclose a risk score; (2) what score(s) must be disclosed;
and (3) what type of explanation of the score, if any, must be provided as part of the disclosure.

In response to these inquiries, the Commission proposes to expand the discussion of risk scores in the FCRA Commentary
as set forth below.

Proposed Revision 



The Commission proposes to delete the single sentence that discusses ``risk scores'' in comment 7 to section 609 of
the FCRA Commentary, and to add a separate comment 12 to read as follows: 

 


12. Risk scores. A consumer reporting agency must disclose to a consumer in response to a consumer's disclosure request:
(a) risk scores (or other numerical evaluations, however named), calculated at the time of the consumer's request;
and (b) a brief statement that explains what the risk score predicts, how the score may be applied by its user, and how
the consumer ranks against other consumers under the scoring model. The agency must disclose this information for
each type of score, regardless of who developed the score, that the agency has reported to its clients within the six
months preceding the date of the consumer's disclosure request (or within two years, if for employment purposes).




Questions for Public Comment 



The Commission requests public comment on this proposed revision to the FCRA Commentary, and is particularly interested
in receiving comments on the questions that follow. Legal and policy analysis of these questions would be particularly
useful. The Commission specifically requests comments based on reasoned analysis of provisions of the FCRA that
discuss the impact of the proposal on consumers and the marketplace. 

(1) What type of risk score disclosure is mandated under section 609 of the FCRA? 

(2) Consumer reporting agencies generally calculate risk scores only when they receive a request for such a score
from a client. Is a consumer entitled to a risk score disclosure if the consumer reporting agency has never reported
a score on that individual? Assuming some prior risk score report is necessary to trigger the disclosure requirement,
does a risk score provided by a consumer reporting agency only in the context of ``prescreening'' provide an appropriate
trigger? 

(3) If provision of a risk score to a client is an appropriate trigger for the disclosure requirement, in what time frame,
if any, must that score have been provided? Are each of the proposed time frames, which are based on sections 609(a)(3)
and 611(d) of the FCRA, proper and sensible? Are they unduly burdensome on credit bureaus or insufficient to provide
adequate disclosure to consumers? 

(4) Risk scoring systems can be created by or for consumer reporting agencies themselves (``generic models''), or
they can be created by or for one or more of the agency's clients (``custom models''). Should the disclosure requirement
for risk scores based on generic models and custom models be the same? 

(5) Credit files are constantly changing. New items are added while older items become statutorily obsolete and are
dropped. Because of the dynamic nature of consumer reports, the risk score that is reported to a creditor at any given
time may differ from the score that would be assigned to that report at a time shortly thereafter. Should ``historical''
risk scores (those actually provided to the agency's clients) or ``current'' risk scores (calculated at the time
of the disclosure) be disclosed to consumers? 

(6) A consumer reporting agency may produce a variety of different risk scores, such as a bankruptcy risk score, a default
risk score, or other types of scores. Should the consumer reporting agency be required to disclose to consumers each
type of risk score it offers its clients the option of purchasing, or only those scores that have actually been provided
about that consumer to one or more clients? 

(7) What explanation, if any, should a consumer reporting agency provide consumers about their risk scores? Should
agencies discuss how the score may be used by their clients? Should agencies specify how the individual consumer ranks
in regard to others? If so, should the ranking be done by percentile or other technique? Should the Commentary specify
the precise form of explanation, or contain expanded requirements as to the details of the explanation? Is the proposal
to require an explanation of the risk score too narrow or too broad? If so, in what way should it be expanded or contracted?


(8) Is there some approach other than disclosure of actual risk scores that would better inform consumers of the information
about them being reported by consumer reporting agencies? For example, might it be more useful for a consumer reporting
agency to provide a single score to all consumers designed to show the likelihood of obtaining credit? Would it be more
helpful for the consumer to receive a list of the elements on which the calculation of such a ``score'' is based, rather
than the actual score and explanation required by the proposal?

Drawback; Application for Exporter's Summary Procedure; Withdrawal



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U. S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; withdrawal. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document withdraws the proposed amendment to the Customs Regulations, which would have permitted drawback
claimants to file only one application for use of the exporter's summary procedure, instead of filing separate applications
for the use of the procedure for each Customs region or district in which they file drawback claims. Customs has determined
that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure, including any necessary provisions to ensure uniformity
in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more appropriately be considered in concert with the broad-based
review and revision of the drawback regulations necessitated by, and which will shortly be undertaken pursuant to,
the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background
 


Drawback is a refund or remission, in whole or in part, of a Customs duty, internal revenue tax, or fee. There are a number
of different kinds of drawback authorized under law. In order to qualify for drawback, there must be an exportation
or a destruction under Customs supervision. The statute providing for specific types of drawback is 19 U.S.C. 1313.
The Customs Regulations implementing the statute are contained in 19 CFR part 191. 

The requirements for establishing the exportation of goods subject to drawback are set forth in subpart E of part 191.
This subpart authorizes the use of several alternative procedures to establish exportation. One of these is the exporter's
summary procedure, which is provided for in  191.53. 

Under the exporter's summary procedure, the claimant is allowed to establish exportation for drawback simply by
summarizing his exports in chronological order, along with certain associated data, using a format acceptable to
the appropriate regional commissioner or district director. 

A drawback claimant wishing to use the exporter's summary procedure must first make application with each regional
commissioner, or, if applicable, with each district director, in whose region or district drawback will be sought.
The regional commissioner or the district director, if applicable, would approve the request, if it is determined
that the use of the procedure would contribute to administrative efficiency, and the claimant is not otherwise delinquent
or remiss in transactions with Customs. This can result in excessive paperwork. 

Accordingly, by a document published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 10, 1992 (57 FR 41446), Customs proposed to amend paragraph (c) of  191.53 so that drawback claimants
would not have to file separate applications to use the exporter's summary procedure in each region or district where
they file drawback claims. Approval, denial, or revocation of a claimant's use of the procedure in one region or district
would govern the claimant's eligibility in all regions and districts. 

While three commenters responded to the notice of proposed rulemaking, all generally favoring adoption of the proposal,
the concern was expressed that there was a lack of uniformity among the various regions and districts in processing
applications to use the exporter's summary procedure. This problem was not resolved or addressed by the regulation
in question. 



Withdrawal of Proposal 



In consideration of the foregoing, and, moreover, in view of the extensive drawback regulation changes necessitated
by the Customs modernization portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub.
L. 103-182,  632), Customs has now determined that any amendment of the exporter's summary procedure,
including any necessary provisions to ensure 4 
uniformity in approving or revoking the use of this procedure, would more properly be considered in concert with the
broad-based review and revision of the drawback regulations which will be shortly undertaken pursuant to the Customs
modernization portion of the NAFTA Implementation Act.

from other offices participated in its development.

Invoicing Procedures for Freight Carriers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service is considering changes to its payment system to permit the implementation of new software applications.
The Postal Service seeks comments from interested parties, because these changes would affect invoicing procedures
for freight transportation carriers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under 39 U.S.C. 401(4), the Postal Service has the general power to determine and keep its own system of accounts and
the forms and contents of its contracts and other business documents. In the past, for freight invoicing purposes,
the Postal Service has generally used Government Bills of Lading, Standard Form 1103 (SF 1103), in accordance with
the procedures set forth in 41 CFR 101-41.000, et seq. The Postal Service is considering changes to its payment
system that would affect invoicing procedures for all freight transportation carriers currently handling shipments
on Government Bills of Lading. Shipments of U.S. Mail, household goods, or other personal property not handled on
SF 1103 would not be covered by the new payment system. 



This change would permit the Postal Service to implement new software applications for freight traffic management.
The principal feature of the new system would be to permit freight carriers to submit billings either electronically,
or by paper invoices using the Public Voucher, Standard Form 1113 (SF 1113), along with the required supporting documentation.


New billing procedures would be drafted to provide guidance both for electronic and paper billing. These procedures
would include information about the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) approval process, Trading Partner Agreements,
submission of electronic invoices, testing rejection and resubmission of valid invoices, payments, and suspension
of EDI operations. Information about waivers, payee codes, and other payment processes would also be included. 

The Postal Service believes that freight carriers electing to conduct business electronically should be required
to use the EDI Standards X12, developed by the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). The Postal Service would obtain commercial EDI Value-Added Network (VAN) services to send and
receive EDI shipping and billing data. Carriers would be required to use the VAN selected by the Postal Service to transfer
data electronically for these transactions. 

Although existing procedures for issuing and paying Government Bills of Lading for Postal Service shipments will
continue, one change would be required to be consistent with electronic practices, if they are implemented. Any carrier
submitting paper billings would be required to include its Tax Identification Number (TIN) on the SF 1113. A TIN for
a parent company would also be required if the carrier is a subsidiary of a parent company. The carrier TIN would be used
for vendor identification during payment processing; the Postal Service would not assign its own vendor supplier
code for this purpose. 

In view of the foregoing, the Postal Service requests comments and proposals from interested parties on the following
matters: 



1. The level of carrier interest in electronic communications to replace hardcopy bills of lading and freight bills.


2. The procedures carriers would prefer to see used for handling these transactions. 

3. The impact upon carriers of adding the carrier's TIN to SF 1113. 



Comments regarding these matters are requested within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice. The Postal
Service will take these comments under consideration as it formulates possible changes in its payment system.

<DOCTITLE>Revisions to Standards Concerning Physical Mailpiece Dimensions, Addressing, and Address Placement </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service proposes changes to several Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards defining a mailpiece's length,
height, and thickness, and relating these dimensions to processing category and other criteria. The Postal Service
also proposes changes to other DMM standards concerning the content and placement of delivery and return addresses,
including placement standards for delivery addresses on flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure,
and letter- and flat-size pieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper; the location of, and the use
of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in, the return address on certain mail; terms related to post office boxes and standards for
their use in addressing mail; and the prohibition of dual addresses on certain types of mail. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards arise from suggestions presented during the 1993
DMM redesign project. 



Revisions Concerning Physical Mailpiece Dimensions and Address Placement 



The proposed revisions to C010 and C050 (with lesser changes to A010, A200, and E312) concern how the physical characteristics
of a mailpiece are used in determining which dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. 
This information is used to determine correct address placement and the mailpiece's mailability, susceptibility
to a nonstandard surcharge, processing category, and rate eligibility. This proposal will apply a consistent definition
of length, height, and thickness to all mail, except for pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats.


Although this proposal affects all addressed mail, its impact will be on address placement on letter-size pieces
(including, for purposes of these standards, cards), which are subject to standards for address placement and orientation
and rate eligibility based on those characteristics. The Postal Service proposes to make the following specific
changes to the DMM: 

1. A010.1.0 is amended to standardize address placement on all letter-size mail claimed at other than a single-piece
rate (or, for pieces within a small dimensional range, at the Barcoded rate for flats) to require that the address be
oriented parallel to the length of the piece (as defined in revised C010.1.1). Letter-size mail, which represents
the majority of postal volume, is processed in a mostly automated or mechanized mailstream. An increasing proportion
of letter-size mail (already subject to strict physical standards) moves through automated equipment, and most
of the remainder is handled by letter-sorting machines. Manual processing_the slowest and most costly handling_is
used for mail having physical or address characteristics that are incompatible with automated or mechanized processing.


Although the Postal Service recognizes that some mail may never be compatible with its equipment, it believes that
such compatibility is a reasonable condition for mail being claimed at a discounted rate. Whether to render a mailpiece
compatible with automation (as under existing standards), mechanization, or human handling, the benefit of the
proposed rule is clear. Certain necessary, basic assumptions about how mail is oriented when its address is to be read
underlie how equipment is designed to receive and move mail and how employees are trained to read, sort, and carry it.
Most letter-size mail has address and dimensional characteristics that are compatible with these assumptions,
but the absence of effective standards allows incompatible mail to enjoy discounts that are incongruous with how
it must be processed. (Nonstandard surcharges do not apply to all such mail.) 

For the sake of creativity, some customers currently generate mail at bulk or presort rates that must be held vertically
(``portrait'' style) rather than horizontally (``landscape'' style) to read the delivery address. Such mailpieces
must be processed manually because they are incompatible with Postal Service automation and mechanized letter-sorting
machines. These pieces cause problems even for the letter carrier, who must turn them to sort and again to deliver.
The Postal Service acknowledges that this proposal will inhibit such mailpiece design practices. However, the benefit
of facilitating efficient processing_for cost and for service_outweighs the minor loss of creative latitude that
will result if the proposed rule is adopted. (Mailers to whom this creative latitude is truly significant will have
the option of mailing pieces at single-piece rates.) However, given the relative proportion of the mailstream represented
by incompatible bulk or presort rate letter-size mail, compared with the volume that is compatible, the Postal Service
believes that few mailers will be impacted by the effects on mailpiece design of the proposed rule.

2. A010.1.0 and A200.1.3 are revised to add mandatory address placement standards for other-than-single-piece
rate flat-size mail prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, or otherwise not prepared in an envelope,
polybag, or similar enclosure. The types of mail affected by this standard are relatively difficult and costly to
process and sort; the second type has the added potential to come apart in the mail, resulting in its failure to reach
the addressee. None of these circumstances benefits the mailer, the Postal Service, or the addressee. The proposed
change will further Postal Service efforts to provide efficient and timely service. 



The first of these mandatory placement standards affects flat-size mailpieces not prepared in a full enclosure and
that may have an open edge presented either forward (as the piece travels through mechanization) or to the right (as
the piece is held for manual sortation, casing, or delivery). The proposed revisions would require that such mail
be addressed so that, when oriented to read the address, the mailpiece is positioned for more efficient processing,
i.e., with its bound or final-folded edge to the right, and that pieces in partial wrappers or sleeves would have to
have the open ends at the top and bottom of the mailpiece. The Postal Service, which has traditionally recommended
that such mail be addressed in the manner described in the proposed rule (see existing Exhibit A200.1.3), has received
only limited cooperation from mailers and, consequently, has been unable to improve the efficiency with which that
mail can be handled. Some mailers (and some postal employees) have said that they were uncertain about whether the
proposed placement was previously required. 



In proposing this standard, the Postal Service seeks to balance the needs of the mailing community with its own operational
need to curtail undesirable addressing practices that raise postal costs. Further, the Postal Service realizes
that, if adopted as a final rule, the operational effect of this proposal on some mailers would require considerable
lead time before actual implementation. Therefore, commenters who are concerned about the effect this proposal
would have on their operations are asked to provide specific information and suggestions: 


 
How could the problems associated with handling the affected mail be overcome by measures other than the proposed
rule as written? 


 
What are commenters prepared to do to make that mail more efficient to handle? 


 
If the proposed rule is adopted, how much lead time would be needed to make the necessary internal operational changes?



 
Would a short-term general implementation date be acceptable if the Postal Service worked with individual customers
and allowed specific exceptions for delayed implementation? 



The second mandatory address placement standard requires that flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve
or partial wrapper must bear a delivery address on the item being mailed itself, by addressing just the item (provided
that the address remains visible when the item is mailed), by addressing both the item and the wrapper, or by using an
address label to firmly attach the item and its wrapper. (Flat-size pieces would also have to meet the standard proposed
above.) The Postal Service has no preference for the method chosen, instead focusing on the objective: Ensuring that
separation of the item and its wrapper do not result in the item becoming undeliverable. Some customers have complained
that existing addressing methods sometimes cause them not to get this type of mail or to receive only the wrapper, pointing
out that the Postal Service's tolerance of the underlying addressing practice is contrary to the best interests of
the addressee. Recognizing the validity of these complaints, the Postal Service proposes to require those mailers
who generate flat-size mailpieces prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper to move to an addressing method
that corrects the problem just described. Commenters who object to this proposal are asked to provide constructive
responses to the same questions asked for in the proposed revision discussed above. 



For consistency, A200.1.3 would be revised to incorporate a reference to the foregoing sections. Other organizational
changes are proposed to A010.1.0 that do not affect the substance of the standards.

3. C010.1.0 is amended to reduce the role of address placement in the determination of which of a mailpiece's physical
dimensions are its length, height, and thickness. Existing standards are inconsistent in associating these basic
physical dimensions to the delivery address. The proposed rule would remedy this by establishing consistent definitions,
based on the physical characteristics of the mailpiece. For the typical letter-size piece, the proposed rule always
defines its length (horizontal dimension) as the longest dimension; the mailpiece's height (vertical dimension)
is the next longest dimension, and the thickness is the remaining dimension. Variations on this rule are proposed
for pieces that do not have three unequal dimensions. While the Postal Service realizes that this change may affect
a small volume of customer mail, as discussed above, the benefits of the consistent definitions contained in the changes
proposed below, and of the processing efficiencies of the mail these proposals would produce, far outweigh any loss
of creative latitude. 



4. C050.1.0 is amended for consistency. By the revised wording, assignment of most mailpieces to a processing category
depends solely on their dimensions as determined by C010.1.0. Existing standards base processing category on physical
dimensions, without regard to address placement, so that the proposed rule, in effect, makes only minor changes to
ensure that this section is harmonious with those discussed above. 



5. C050.5.0 is amended to make it clear that merchandise samples are not by definition always irregular parcels, and
may be categorized as letter- or flat-size pieces based on the usual criteria. 




Other Revisions Concerning Addressing 





1. These proposed changes to Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards relate to the content and placement of delivery
and return addresses. The proposed revisions are intended to serve two general purposes: making existing standards
more consistent and improving the address quality of mail. 



2. Revisions to the standards in A010.4.3 and 4.5 are proposed to mandate the use of a ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code in the return
address on certain mail. (The standard for required use of a return address is not changed by these proposals.) Specifically,
by the proposed revision to A010.4.3, the correct ZIP Code or ZIP+4 code would be required in the return address on any
mail where a return address is itself required under existing standards. Further, by the proposed change to A010.4.5,
the existing placement standard for the return address on mail claimed at a ZIP+4 rate is both made more specific and
extended to all mail on which a return address is required. Under the proposed rule, the return address must be placed
in the top left corner of the address side, area, or label of the mailpiece, parallel to the delivery address. On ZIP+4
rate cards and letter-size mailpieces that do not bear a delivery point barcode, the return address would have to be
outside the OCR read area (a current requirement applied broadly to all ZIP+4 rate mail). 



The proposed revisions should facilitate the accurate and efficient return of mail by making complete return address
information available in a readily identifiable location. Because mailers know their own ZIP Codes, the Postal Service
believes that the proposed standards do not represent either a significant new burden on customers or one that customers
will have serious problems in implementing. Customers who believe that deferred implementation will be necessary
are asked to indicate this in their comments, with an explanation of why they require deferral and how long an adjustment
period they require, and should propose appropriate terms for excepting those mailers/mailings while the necessary
operational adjustments are made. 



3. A010.5.3 is added to clarify the meaning and appropriate use of the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO
Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations. These terms are sometimes incorrectly used to denote destinations
other than post office box or caller service, such as a rural or highway contract route box, a college or business mailroom
box, or a private commercial mail receiving agent. As a result, the imprecise use of terms conveys incorrect information
or causes misinterpretation, either of which sometimes impedes the Postal Service in providing the desired service_delivering
the mail where the sender intends. The potential for misdelivery has increased in today's automated mail processing
environment: Optical character readers scan and ``read'' addresses to determine the correct delivery point barcode
to assign to the mailpiece. Once this barcode is applied, the mailpiece is processed with minimal human intervention
so that ambiguous address information applied by the mailer may result in a misdirected mailpiece. 



To avoid these potential delivery problems, the proposed standard defines the terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O.
Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``POB,'' ``P. O. B.,'' and similar combinations as referring exclusively to the delivery services
provided by the Postal Service under D910 and D920 (Post Office Box Service and Caller Service, respectively). The
proposed standard states that those terms are always included in the correct address of mail destined for post office
box or caller service addresses, that they are incorrect for mail intended for other addresses, and that the Postal
Service cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly addressed mail. (Correct addressing practices are described
in detail in Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards, available from postal business centers and larger post
offices.) 

This proposed rule will not have an adverse affect on customers because it merely clarifies the correct use of these
terms. Moreover, many large mailers have already taken measures to improve the quality of their address lists, and
may have already standardized such lists in conformance with the proposed rule. 



4. A010.3.2c is also revised for organizational consistency.

5. Proposed changes to A010.5.1 should minimize the problems associated with dual addresses. Dual addresses, which
typically include both a street address and a post office box, can lead to confusion for USPS employees identifying
to which location the Postal Service is expected to make delivery despite the existing standards that the address
immediately above the city-state-ZIP Code line takes precedence. Dual addressing can result in a potential for misdelivery
(to the unintended address) as well as the potential for confusion and dissatisfaction on the part of the sender, addressee,
or both. (Under the proposed rule, for those ZIP Code areas having no delivery service other than by post office box
service, the correct address will be to the intended recipient's post office box address.) 
Accurate delivery to the intended addressee is always important, but more so when the item has been identified by the
sender as having exceptional value through the level of service selected (e.g., Express Mail or Priority Mail, or
registered, certified, restricted delivery, or special delivery mail). Therefore, under the proposed rule, dual
addresses are prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on those types of mail. Although this change may cause
occasional inconvenience for some customers, the Postal Service believes that any inconvenience is more than offset
by elimination of the ambiguity and delay potentially associated with dual addressing. This benefit is particularly
true because the sender has invested a relatively large sum to ensure safe and accurate delivery. 
The proposed rule also prohibits dual addresses on any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. Because of the problems
described above, allowing dual addressing on this mail would be inconsistent with the Postal Service's ongoing efforts
to improve address quality in volume mailings. Whereas this prohibition may have the appearance of a sweeping new
requirement, its net affect should be minimal. Most mailers who use bulk or presort rates have enough awareness of
addressing standards to know why dual addresses are not advisable and, therefore, seldom use them. The majority of
those same mailers are already involved in ongoing address management to improve the quality of their addressing
practices. 
Mail sent at single-piece First-, 

third-, or fourth-class rates, without the special services mentioned earlier, is not subject to the proposed rule's
prohibitions though mailers are advised not to use dual addresses on this mail to ensure delivery to the intended address.



Miscellaneous organizational and technical revisions are also being proposed for clarity and consistency. 
Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c))
regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed
revisions of the DMM, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR Part 111.

1.3 

Placement 


Specific conditions apply to certain types of mail; for purposes of these standards, letter-size mailpieces include
cards; flat-size mailpieces include letter-size pieces eligible for and claimed at a Barcoded rate for flats: 
a. The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size mailpiece unless that piece is paid at a single-piece
rate. Letter-size mailpieces bearing an address oriented otherwise are not eligible for any presort or automation-based
discount and may be nonmailable or subject to a nonstandard surcharge. First-Class card-rate pieces and all mail
claimed at an automation rate are subject to additional standards. 
b. If flat-size mail is not prepared in an envelope, polybag, or similar complete enclosure, the delivery address
must be placed so that when the mailpiece is held to read the address, the bound edge or (if applicable) final-folded
edge of the mailpiece is to the right, the address is at the top of the mailpiece parallel with the top edge, and, for mailpieces
prepared in a sleeve or partial wrapper, the open ends of the sleeve or partial wrapper are at the top and bottom of the
mailpiece. 
c. If flat-size mail is prepared in an unattached sleeve or partial wrapper, the address must be placed on the enclosed
material so that it can be read without moving the wrapper, or on both the wrapper and the enclosed matter, unless the
address label is used to attach the wrapper to the enclosed matter. 
d. If mail including an attachment does not bear the name and address of both the sender and intended recipient on both
the host and the attachment, the sender's name and address must be placed on the host piece or the delivery address label
(which may also show the return address) must be used to affix the attachment securely to the host. Combination containers
that have inseparable parts or compartments (e.g., cartons with letter-size envelopes completely and securely
attached to one side) are mailable with the names and addresses on only one.

Basic addressing standards for First-, third-, and fourth-class mail and for Express Mail are in E100, E300, E400,
and E500, respectively. The detailed addressing standards for second-class mail are in A200. Additional standards
apply to overseas military mail, Department of State mail, mail in window envelopes, international mail, and mail
claimed at any automation rate.

Placement 


On any mail on which a return address is required, and on non-delivery point barcoded mail claimed at any ZIP+4 rate,
the return address must be on the same side as, and parallel to, the delivery address, in the top left corner of the address
side, area, or label of the mailpiece. Also, on non-delivery point barcoded ZIP+4 rate mailpieces, the return address
must not be in the OCR read area, and must not extend farther than one-half the length of the mailpiece to the right edge,
and no lower than one-third the height of the mailpiece from the top (see Exhibit 4.5). 


5.0 

Restrictions 


5.1 

Dual Address 


A dual address is one that contains two delivery points, e.g., a street address and a post office box number (see Exhibit
5.1), and is subject to these restrictions: 
a. A dual address is prohibited in the delivery and return addresses on Express Mail, Priority Mail, special delivery
mail, registered mail, certified mail, restricted delivery mail, and any mail claimed at a bulk or presort rate. 
b. Other mail bearing a dual address is delivered (or returned, as applicable) to the address immediately above the
city and state (or to the post office box if both the street address and post office box are on the same line). If a ZIP+4
code or 5-digit ZIP Code is used in any dual address, it must correspond to the address element immediately above the
city and state (or with the post office box number in the address if both the street address and post office box are on
the same line). 


* * * * * 


5.3 

Post Office Box Mail 


The terms ``post office box,'' ``P. O. Box,'' ``PO Box,'' ``P. O. B.,'' ``POB,'' and other similar combinations refer
exclusively to the delivery services provided by the USPS under D910 and D920, and the correct address for those services
always includes one of these terms. These terms are not correctly used on mail intended for delivery through a private
box system or to other types of addresses (e.g., rural route boxes). The USPS cannot ensure accurate delivery of incorrectly
addressed mail.

Address Placement 


Addresses and address labels must be visible. Subject to the general standards in A010, addresses or address labels
may be placed on wrappers (on a flat side, not on the fold); label carriers; subscription order, renewal, gift, or request
forms or receipts; incidental First-Class attachments; or supplements, but only if those items and the host second-class
publication are enclosed within a plastic wrapper (polybag). The delivery address must parallel the length of a letter-size
mailpiece, as defined in C010.

Determining Length and Height 



Except as provided by 1.6, mailpiece length and height are determined as follows: 

a. For pieces having three different dimensions, the longest dimension of a mailpiece is its length (horizontal dimension);
the next longest, its height (vertical dimension); the shortest, its thickness. 

b. For pieces having two equal dimensions: 

(1) If the third dimension is longer than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's length (horizontal dimension);
the remaining dimensions are its height and thickness. 

(2) If the third dimension is shorter than the equal dimensions, it is the mailpiece's thickness; of the remaining
dimensions, the length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is the remaining dimension. 

c. For pieces having three equal dimensions, or having an irregular shape, or requiring a specific orientation because
of the contents, the location and orientation of the address on the mailpiece establish which dimensions are its height
and length. The length is the dimension parallel to the address as read; the height is perpendicular to the length on
the address side of the piece.

1.4 

Maximum 



No single addressed mailpiece may exceed 70 pounds or 108 inches in length and girth combined. Girth is the total distance
around the mailpiece, measured at its thickest part, perpendicular to its length. 



1.5 

Nonmailable 



Except for keys and identification devices, all pieces not meeting the minimum size standards above are nonmailable.




1.6 

Other Standards 



Mailpieces to be claimed at the Barcoded rate for flats are subject to the definitions of length and height in C820 (rather
than 1.1). The standards for specific classes or rates may prescribe higher minimum and/or lower maximum size and
weight limits than those stated above.

1.8 

Top and Bottom 



For single-piece rate mail and pieces eligible for and claimed at the Barcoded or third-class carrier route rate for
flats, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its upper and lower edges, respectively, when the
delivery address is oriented to be read. For other mail, the top and bottom of a letter- or flat-size mailpiece are its
upper and lower edges, respectively, when the mailpiece is positioned with the length horizontal.

Clean Air Act Disapproval of Operating Permits Program; Commonwealth of Virginia



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed disapproval.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to disapprove the Operating Permits Program submitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose
of complying with Federal requirements which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources. The reasons for proposing disapproval
are as follows: Virginia's program does not contain the necessary legal authority to afford judicial review to persons
who have participated in the public comment process, and it also does not contain the necessary legal authority to
prevent default issuance of a permit. The submitted regulations have an expiration date of June 28, 1994 and cannot
be applied or enforced after that date. Also, the regulatory portion of the program does not include the proper universe
of sources required to be subject to a state operating permit program or ensure that permits contain all applicable
requirements, or correctly delineating provisions enforceable only by the Commonwealth. In addition, there are
other deficiencies in Virginia's submitted program, as specified in the Technical Support Document, which must
be corrected before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's operating permits program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


A. Introduction


As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``CAA''), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements
of an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA
will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of State operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)).
These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing
these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources.

The CAA requires that states develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA take actions
to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs
pursuant to section 502 of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70, which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by November 15, 1995, or by the end of an interim
program period, it must establish and implement a Federal operating permits program.
 
On November 12, 1993, Virginia submitted an operating permits program for review by EPA. It was received by EPA on November
19, 1994. The submittal was supplemented by a letter dated January 14, 1994, and was found to be administratively complete
pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(e)(1). The submittal contains a program description, a legal opinion from the Virginia Attorney
General, confirmation of regulatory authority, program and fee regulations, relevant portions of Virginia statutes,
guidance and forms, a description of enforcement provisions, a resource and fee demonstration, and a transition
plan.



B. Federal Oversight and Sanctions



Sanctions must be imposed 18 months after EPA disapproves a state submittal, unless prior to expiration of the 18-month
period the state submits a revised program that EPA approves. If a state has not submitted a revised program that EPA
approves within 6 months after EPA applies the first sanction, a second sanction is required. In addition, discretionary
sanctions may be applied any time during the 18-month period following the date required for program submittal or
the date of program disapproval. If the Commonwealth does not have an approved program by November 15, 1995, EPA must
promulgate, administer, and enforce a Federal operating permits program for the Commonwealth. 
 


II. Summary and Analysis of State Submission



The analysis contained in this document focuses on the major portions of Virginia's submittal and particularly portions
which must be corrected to meet the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal, the Technical
Support Document, and other relevant materials are available for detailed information as part of the public docket.
The docket may be viewed during regular business hours at the address listed above.



A. Statutory Authority



1. Standing for Judicial Review


The Attorney General of the Commonwealth, in his opinion dated November 5, 1993, states that ``the laws of the Commonwealth
provide adequate authority to carry out all aspects of the Commonwealth's program for Federal operating permits.''
The Attorney General cites Va. Code section 10.1-1318(B) as providing an opportunity for judicial review to
any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the State Air Pollution Control Board and who meets certain criteria,
including having an immediate, pecuniary, and substantial interest. The requirement for standing for judicial
review, as specifically required by section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x), must provide standing
for any person who has participated in the public comment process and any other person who could obtain judicial review
of that action under applicable law. EPA interprets section 502(b)(6) of the CAA as requiring that title V permits
programs must provide judicial review to any party who participated on the public comment process and who at a minimum
meets the threshold standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution. 

In comparison, Section 10.1-1318(B) of the Code of Virginia extends the right to seek judicial review only to
persons who have suffered an ``actual, threatened, or imminent injury...'' where ``such injury is an invasions of
an immediate, legally protected, pecuniary and substantial interest which is concrete and particularized...''
The Virginia statute, as well Virginia case law does not enable a party who meets the minimum threshold standing requirements
of Article III of the U.S. Constitution access to the Commonwealth's court system. The Commonwealth's Attorney General's
opinion submitted with Virginia's program states that ``the inclusion of the word 'pecuniary' in the amended Virginia
law means the requirement for standing to obtain judicial review may be more stringent than Article III standing requirements,
as the EPA interprets them under the United States Supreme Court decision in 

Lujan

 v. 

Defenders of Wildlife

, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136 (1992) and related cases.'' 

The limitations on judicial review in Virginia do not meet the minimum threshold standing requirements of Article
III of the U.S. Constitution and thus do not meet the minimum program approval criteria under title V. Therefore, EPA
is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not meet the minimum requirement for standing for judicial
review. Va. Code section 10.1-1318(B) must be amended. 


2. Default Issuance of Permits


Va. Code section 9-6.14:3 provides that the purpose of Virginia's Administrative Process Act is to supplement
present and future basic laws. Although Regulations sections 120-08-0525 C and E provide for EPA veto
and affected states review, these regulations may be superseded by the Administrative Process Act. Sections 9-6.14:11
and 9-6.14:12 of the Administrative Process Act provide that a party may provide written notice to the agency
that a decision on a permit is due, and that the decision is deemed in favor of the named party if no decision is reached
within 30 days. This provision prevents the Commonwealth from meeting the requirement of section 505(b)(3) of the
CAA that no permit be issued unless it is revised to meet the objection of EPA, if EPA objects to the permit within 45 days
after receiving a copy of the proposed permit. This provision also prevents the Commonwealth from meeting  70.8(e),
which requires the Attorney General to certify that no provision of state law requires that a permit be issued after
a certain time if the permitting authority has failed to take action on the application. Virginia must ensure that
no permit will be issued by default through this process until affected states and EPA have had a chance to review the
proposed permit as required by 40 CFR 70.8. In addition Virginia must ensure that no permit will be issued through this
process if EPA has objected within 45 days. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it does not ensure
that EPA and affected states are given an adequate opportunity for review of proposed permits and that no permit will
be issued if EPA objects.




B. Regulations and Program Implementation



1. Effectiveness and Enforceability of Rules


The Virginia operating permit program Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution (Regulations)
Emergency Rule 8-5, Federal Operating Permits for Stationary Sources, and Emergency Rule 8-6, Permit
Program Fees, do not meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Although the rules are currently effective, they expire
on June 28, 1994 and cannot be implemented or enforced beyond that date. EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's
program because its regulations expire on June 28, 1994. 



2. Applicability Under the Operating Permits Program




a. Definitions and Exemptions.

 The requirements of   70.2 and 70.3 for applicability have not been met. Primarily, Virginia's regulations
at section 120-08-0502 and section 120-08-0602 do not correctly define major source or stationary
source. Virginia's definitions, and the exemptions of insignificant activities and affected sources found in section
120-08-0501 of Virginia's regulations limit the universe of sources that are applicable to Rule 8-5
by exempting or deferring sources that are required by 40 CFR part 70 to obtain an operating permit. EPA is proposing
to disapprove Virginia's program because the regulations do not apply to the proper universe of sources. Further
discussion of these deficiencies is contained in the Technical Support Document.



b. Variances.

 Virginia has the authority to issue a variance from requirements imposed by Virginia law. The variance provision
at Va. Code section 10.1-1307.C. empowers the Air Pollution Control Board, after a public hearing, to grant
a local variance from any regulation adopted by the board. EPA regards this provision as wholly external to the program
submitted for approval under 40 CFR part 70, and consequently is proposing to take no action on this provision of Virginia
law. EPA has no authority to approve provisions of state law, such as the variance provision referred to, which are
inconsistent with the CAA. EPA does not recognize the ability of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty
to comply with a federally enforceable permit, except where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by
40 CFR part 70. EPA reserves the right to enforce the terms of the permit where the permitting authority purports to
grant relief from the duty to comply with a permit in a manner inconsistent with 40 CFR part 70 procedures. 



3. Applicable Federal Requirements and Federally Enforceable Provisions 


Virginia's submittal does not ensure the Commonwealth's ability to issue permits which include all applicable Federal
requirements and which correctly delineate requirements that are enforceable only by Virginia. The Commonwealth
also cites Virginia's regulations rather than Federal regulations (in the form of federally promulgated regulations
or state regulations that have been approved into the State Implementation Plan) in the definitions in section 120-08-0502.
In section 120-08-0507, Federal enforceability is incorrectly extended to portions of Virginia's regulations
that have been submitted, but not yet approved, into the State Implementation Plan. 

EPA is proposing to disapprove Virginia's program because it explicitly purports to extend Federal enforceability
to provisions which are not enforceable by the administrator and also does not include certain provisions which must
be considered federally enforceable (and thus applicable) requirements. 



4. Public Participation and Affected State Review


Virginia uses the term ``locality particularly affected'' in determining the geographic scope of notification
to the public of a public comment period on a draft permit. This scope is too narrow and it does not fully meet the requirements
of 40 CFR 70.7(h) for public participation. For full approval, Virginia must ensure that any locality that could potentially
be affected by a permit would be notified of the opportunity for public comment on that permit. In addition, Virginia
incorrectly exempts minor permit modifications from the requirement under  70.8(b)(2) for affected state
review of those modifications. Virginia must also correct this deficiency before EPA can grant full approval to Virginia's
program. 



C. Permit Fees and Demonstration



Va. Code section 10.1-1322.1 and Rule 8-6 allow for a fee rate of up to $25 per ton, as adjusted by the consumer
price index (CPI), of emissions to be charged to a source. The fee is set by the Air Pollution Control Board and can be
adjusted annually, without exceeding the statutory cap, to meet the costs of implementation of the program. Virginia's
fee revenue projections are based on revenues from a $25 per ton fee, using 1990 as a base year, and adjusted annually
by the CPI, as set out in Section 502 of the CAA. However, no specific fee schedule was included in the submittal and the
cap on the fee amount limits the Board's flexibility in ensuring that revenues are sufficient to cover the direct and
indirect costs of the program. (CAA section 502(b)(3)(A) and Va. Code section 10.1-1322. B.) Va. Code section
10.1-1322. B. precludes the Commonwealth from collecting title V fees to cover the indirect costs charged and
collected by the Commonwealth's Department of Accounts. This provision violates 40 CFR 70.9(b).

The fee amounts projected by Virginia in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table, although sufficient to cover
the estimated costs of the program (as set out in the resource demonstration), do not accurately reflect the mandate
of Va. Code section 10.1-1322.1 to adjust fees using the CPI calculation method stipulated in CAA section 502.
Also, it is unclear whether or not the estimated emissions used in the ``Total Fee Revenue Projections'' table include
emissions from acid rain sources, which Virginia exempts from fees in the years 1995 to 1999 (section 120-08-0601
C.5.) or includes Hazardous Air Pollutants. 

In order for EPA to grant full approval to Virginia's program, the Commonwealth must remove the statutory impediment
to using permit fees to fund certain indirect costs of its program and ensure that the Commonwealth's fee provision
comply with 40 CFR part 70.




D. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the CAA



1. Authority and Commitments for Section 112 Implementation 


In Va. Code section 10.1-1322.A. and Rule 8-5, Virginia has demonstrated broad legal authority to incorporate
into permits and enforce all applicable CAA section 112 requirements. However, Virginia also indicated that additional
authority may be necessary to conduct specific section 112 activities, and did not commit to implementing CAA section
112(r) for prevention of accidental release. Virginia supplemented its broad legal authority with a commitment
to ``develop the state regulatory provisions as necessary to carry out these programs and the responsibilities under
the delegation after approval of the operating permit program and EPA has issued the prerequisite guidance for development
of these title III programs.'' Also, Virginia has the authority under section 120-08-0505 K to require
that an applicant state that the source has complied with CAA section 112(r) or state in the compliance plan that the
source intends to comply and has set a schedule to do so. In the case of CAA section 112(g) requirements, EPA notes that
Virginia must begin to implement this program upon approval of an operating permits program.




2. Authority and Commitments for Implementation of Acid Rain Requirements 


Virginia has committed to adopting regulations to meet the requirements of the Acid Rain program by January 1, 1995.
The Attorney General, in his November 5, 1993 opinion, committed to including a statutory and regulatory analysis
of the acid rain portions of the operating permits program in the January 1, 1995 submittal. Virginia has begun its
regulatory development process to adopt regulations for the acid rain portion of the Virginia Operating Permits
Program. 


III. Request for Public Comments



EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this document or on other relevant matters. These comments
will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in this Federal rulemaking action
by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this document. EPA has received a petition from the Environmental Defense Fund, dated December 23, 1993,
to disapprove Virginia's operating permits program. This petition will be included in the docket and will be considered
in EPA's final action.



Proposed Action


EPA is proposing to disapprove the operating permits program submitted by the Commonwealth on November 12, 1993.
If promulgated, this disapproval will constitute a disapproval under section 502(d) of the CAA (see generally 57
FR 32253-32254). As provided under section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth will have up to 180 days from
the date of EPA's notification of disapproval for the Governor of Virginia to revise and resubmit the program. EPA
is proposing to disapprove this program on the basis that Virginia has not met the following five requirements: 




1. Pursuant to section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and 70.7(h), adequate provisions for public participation
in the permit process, including statutory authority that meets the minimum threshold for judicial standing.
2. Pursuant to section 505(b)(3) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.8(e), authority to prevent default issuance of permits. 
3. Regulations that expire on June 28, 1994.
4. Issuance of permits to the proper universe of sources required by 40 CFR part 70 to be included in the Commonwealth's
operating permit program. 
5. Regulations that meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70 ensuring issuance of permits that contain all applicable
Federal requirements and correctly delineate provisions only enforceable by the Commonwealth. 




Virginia must amend its program to correct the deficiencies and resubmit all relevant portions of the program, including
a revised Attorney General's opinion. The Technical Support Document discusses Virginia's submittal in detail,
and contains specific references to revisions and modifications necessary to obtain full approval. Submittal of
revised portions of Virginia's operating permit program, including revised statutes and regulations, will undergo
additional notice and comment in the 

Federal Register

 before EPA takes final action on the program submittal, if those revised portions are received before November 19,
1994. November 19, 1994 is one year from the date of receipt of the submittal and the date by which EPA is required under
40 CFR 70.4(e) to take final action on the current submittal.

The Commonwealth of Virginia must submit a corrected program within 180 days following final EPA disapproval of the
program. If Virginia fails to submit a fully approvable whole part 70 program, or a required revision thereto, in conformance
with the provision of 40 CFR 70.4, EPA may, at any time, apply one of the sanctions specified in section 179(b) of the
Act. Sanctions must be imposed 18 months after EPA disapproves a state's submittal. 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this action from Executive Order 12866 review. 

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 

EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 502 of the CAA does not affect any existing requirements applicable
to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval
of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not impose any new Federal requirements.

 The Regional Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Virginia's operating permits program will be based
on whether it meets the requirements of title V of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 70.

AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public meeting.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing a public meeting prior to proposing effluent guidelines and standards
for the Coastal Oil and Gas subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction category. EPA intends to propose a rule in January
1995, and this is the only public meeting that the Agency plans to sponsor prior to proposal. The meeting is intended
to be a forum in which EPA can report on the status of regulatory development and in which interested parties can provide
information and ideas to the Agency on key technical, scientific, and other issues.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA is developing effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the Coastal Oil and Gas subcategory under authority
of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The Coastal subcategory includes operations involved in drilling
for and production of oil and gas in the coastal areas of the United States. Such coastal areas include states bordering
the Gulf of Mexico, the coast of California, and both the North Slope and Cook Inlet in Alaska.


The public meeting will include discussions of the effluent guidelines regulatory development process, applicability
of the forthcoming rule, regulatory approach (i.e. treatment technologies considered for effluent limits and their
costs), affected population estimates, and general coastal oil and gas issues. The meeting will not be recorded by
a reporter or transcribed for inclusion in the record for the Coastal Oil and Gas industry rule. 
Documents relating to the topics mentioned above and a more detailed agenda will be available at the meeting.

Public Mobile Services


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to its rules governing the Public Mobile Services.
The proposed further revisions are necessary to update these rules. The intent of this proposal is to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden
on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide
service to the public as expeditiously as possible.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Summary of the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking


The following is a summary of the Commission's further notice of proposed rulemaking in CC Docket No. 92-115,
adopted April 20, 1994 and released May 20, 1994. The full texts of all Commission decisions are available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The
complete text of this decision may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Services, (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.
1. In this Further Notice, the Federal Communications Commission proposes further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. The
rules in part 22 govern the Public Mobile Services. These revisions are proposed in order to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, reduce the processing and review burden
on the Commission's staff, and ensure that licensees in the public mobile services are fully qualified to provide
service to the public as expeditiously as possible.
2. On May 14, 1992, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the docket 57 FR 29260, July 1, 1992 proposing
comprehensive revisions to part 22. Prior to adoption of a Report and Order in this proceeding, Congress enacted the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act) which amends section 3(n) and section 332 of the Communications
Act. The Budget Act creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services, including existing
part 22 common carrier mobile services, private land mobile services, and future services. Because of the broad statutory
changes that affect the regulation of mobile services, action on the part 22 revision was deferred. The proposals
adopted in the further notice augment those proposals adopted in the notice.
3. We propose to require licensees notifying the Commission of minor modifications to their systems on FCC Form 489,
which include Service Area Boundary (SAB) extensions into the adjacent market, to specify whether the 5 year fill-in
period for the market has expired and, if so, to state that the SAB extension does not cover any unserved area. Current
rules allow a cellular licensee to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular service territory pursuant to a written
agreement with the latter licensee. A licensee is permitted to expand its SAB into an adjacent cellular geographic
service area (CGSA) at any time and may extend into an adjacent metropolitan service area or a rural service area provided
the 5 year fill-in period has not expired. Many of the contracts included with FCC Forms 489 that notify the Commission
of such minor modifications simply acknowledge a licensee's permission to allow a SAB extension into its market,
even when the 5 year fill-in period has expired. In these cases, the staff must devote a significant amount of time to
determine if the SAB extension covers any unserved area, because licensees may apply to serve such area only by filing
a separate application with the Commission.
4. We propose to revise the scale of the maps required to be filed by the Commission's rules from 1:250,000 to 1:500,000.
We believe that reducing the map scale would serve the public interest by reducing both filing burdens on applicants
as well as review burdens on the staff.
5. We propose to modify the rules to allow cellular licensees to make minor changes to their facilities and to add transmitters
within the contours of authorized stations without seeking prior approval or notifying the Commission of such changes.
If we adopt this proposal, we plan to eliminate the listing of internal cell sites on our authorizations for existing
licensees. However, we intend to maintain accurate, current information regarding the cell sites that constitute
a system's CGSA boundary_i.e., the external cell sites. Therefore, we propose to require all cellular licenses to
submit the following information for each of their external cell sites: (1) The geographic coordinates and cell site
location description as required in Item 27 on Schedule B of FCC Form 401 and (2) the operating and technical parameters
for the cell site which is currently required in Table MOB 2 and Table MOB 3 of FCC Form 401. This is a one time filing that
would assist the staff in updating the Commission's database systems.
6. We propose to modify the information that licensees must submit pursuant to rule  22.925 of the Commission's
rules. First, consistent with the proposal to revise the map scale, we propose to revise the scale of the full-size
map to a scale of 1:500,000. Second, we propose to require that all maps submitted pursuant to this rule show only the
exterior cell sites and their respective service area boundaries that make up the CGSA. Third, we propose to require
licensees to include an exhibit providing the coordinates for each exterior cell site and the information currently
required in the MOB 3 Table of FCC Form 401. Fourth, we propose to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit a
frequency utilization plan or chart. Fifth, we propose to require licensees to label all System Information Update
maps with specific language explaining which carrier is filing the map and for which market.

7. We propose that for all 931 MHz paging applications, applicants must specify the frequency for which they seek authorization.
The frequency requested must be available at the time the application is filed. Applications that are acceptable
for filing will be placed on public notice. Mutually exclusive applications received within 30 days after the public
notice will be considered one processing group. Mutually exclusive applicants for specific frequencies that are
accepted for filing after July 26, 1993 would be subject to the competitive bidding process. We also propose that applicants
for 931 MHz paging frequencies with applications pending when final rules become effective be given 60 days from the
effective date of a final order in this proceeding to amend their applications to specify frequencies for which they
seek authorization. Failure to amend a pending application to specify a frequency will result in dismissal of that
application. All pending amended applications and newly filed applications that are mutually exclusive and received
within 60 days of the effective date of this Order will be considered together as a processing group this one time only.
We propose that the amended applications be subject to the competitive bidding process. However, we seek comment
on whether we should instead use lotteries for these applications.

8. We propose to consider the following to be an initial 931 MHz paging application: (1) an application anywhere on
a new frequency and (2) a proposal to locate a new facility more than two kilometers (1.6 miles) from any existing facility
operating on the same frequency. A 931 MHz paging application would be considered a modification of an existing system
only if: (1) It proposes a new location two kilometers or less from a previously authorized and fully operational base
station licensed to the same licensee operating on the same frequency; or (2) the application is for a change of location
within two kilometers of an existing station licensed to the same licensee; or (3) the application proposes a technical
change that would not increase the service contour. We tentatively conclude that we will use first come, first served
procedures to process 931 MHz paging modification licenses in cases in which we conclude, as a result of our examination
of the issue in this rulemaking proceeding, that the use of competitive bidding procedures would not be legally permissible
or otherwise appropriate. Under the first come, first served procedure, only manually exclusive modification applications
received on the same day would, consistent with the Budget Act, be designated for comparative hearing to determine
which modification application should be granted.

9. We welcome comment on any and all of the proposed further revisions to 47 CFR part 22. We also invite suggestions for
any other proposals or refinements to the proposals that we have made in this proceeding.

10. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rulemaking proceeding. 

Ex parte 

presentations are permitted except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided in
Commission rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 1.1203 and 1.1206(a).

11. Pursuant to applicable procedures in 47 CFR 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before
June 20, 1994 and reply comments on or before July 5, 1994. All relevant and timely comments will be considered by the
Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding. To file formally in this proceeding, participants must
file an original and four copies of all comments, reply comments and supporting comments. If participants want each
Commissioner to receive a personal copy of their comments, an original plus nine copies must be filed. Comments and
reply comments should be sent to Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.
Comments and reply comments will be available for public inspection during regular business hours in the Dockets
Reference Room (room 239) of the Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554.

12. Accordingly, it is ordered that, pursuant to section 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,
47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r), this further notice of proposed Rulemaking is issued. It is further ordered, That the
Secretary shall cause a copy of this further notice to be sent to the Chief Counsel for advocacy of the Small Business
Administration.

Action:

 Proposed new and revised collections.





Respondents:

 Businesses or other for profit, including small businesses.





Frequency of Response:

 On occasion.





Public Burden For the Collections Is Estimated As Follows:

 









Needs and Uses:

 The further notice of proposed rulemaking solicits public comment to revise part 22 of FCC's rules governing the Public
Mobile Services. The revisions are proposed in order to make the rules easier to understand, eliminate outdated rules
and unnecessary information collection requirements, streamline licensing procedures, and allow licensees greater
flexibility in providing service to the public. Generally, the collected information is used to determine the legal
and technical qualifications of the respondents.




Regulatory Flexibility





Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission's initial regulatory flexibility analysis follows:




Reason for Action and Objective





The Commission is proposing to revise title 47, part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations to eliminate unnecessary
information collection requirements and, whenever possible, provide greater flexibility to carriers while at
the same time promoting the public interest. The objective of this proposal is to provide effective and adaptive regulation
for communications.




Legal Basis





Authority for this further notice is contained in sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.
154(i) and 303(r).




Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements





The proposed rules would not significantly change the existing reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements.
In the case of required map filings, for example, the proposal merely changes the scale of the map filed. Several new
requirements are proposed. For example, one of the proposed new rules would require that cellular licensees submit
information for each of their external cell sites. Another proposed rule would require that applicants for 931 MHz
paging service request specific frequencies in their applications.





Federal Rules That Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules





None.





Description, Potential Impact and Number of Small Entities Affected





There are approximately 8,600 licensees subject to the rules in part 22. A substantial portion of these are small entities.
There are also a number of small entities whose business is consulting or providing other services in connection with
part 22. The proposed further notice would not significantly impact these small entities.





Significant Alternatives Minimizing Impact on Small Entities and Consistent With States Objectives





The proposals contained in this Further Notice are meant to simplify and ease the regulatory burden on all Public Mobile
Services applicants and licensees consistent with the Commission's established public interest objectives.



The Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration will be served with a copy of this Further Notice
of Proposed Rule Making in accordance with section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603(a).

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Overhead Should-Cost Reviews 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DoD). Q02


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with request for public comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Defense is proposing changes to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)
to provide criteria for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 






A. Background 



This proposed rule originated based on a recommendation in the General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October
30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can Help Reduce Overhead Costs,'' which recommends that regulations
be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead should-cost reviews. The proposed rule modifies DFARS 215.810
to supplement the FAR rule published for public comment on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16388). It provides specific criteria
for when DoD activities should consider performing should-cost reviews. 



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The proposed rule is not expected to have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

, because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews.
An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small
businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS sections will
also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS
Case 94-610 in correspondence. 



C. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed rule does not impose any additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements which require the approval
of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

Therefore, it is proposed that 48 CFR part 215 be amended as follows: 

1. The authority citation for 48 CFR part 215 continues to read as follows: 






Authority: 

41 U.S.C. 421 and 48 CFR part 1. 



PART 215_CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION 



2. Section 215.810 is revised to read as follows: 



215.810 

Should-cost review. 



3. Section 215.810-2 is added to read as follows: 



215.810-2 

Program should-cost review. 



(b) DoD contracting activities should consider performing a program should-cost review before award of a definitive
major systems contract exceeding $100 million.

4. Section 215.810-3 is added to read as follows:



215.810-3



Overhead should-cost review.



(b)(i) The Defense Contract Management Command/Defense Logistics Agency (DCMC/DLA), or the military department
responsible for performing contract administration functions (e.g., Navy SUPSHIP), should consider performing
an overhead should-cost review of a contractor business unit (as defined in FAR 31.001) when all the following conditions
exist_

(A) Projected annual sales to DoD exceed $1 billion;

(B) Projected DoD vs. total business exceeds 30 percent;

(C) High level of sole-source DoD contracts;

(D) Significant volume of proposal activity anticipated; and

(E) Production or development of major weapon system or program anticipated.

(ii) The head of the contracting activity may request an overhead should-cost review for a business unit which does
not meet the criteria in paragraph (b)(i) of this subsection.

(iii) Overhead should-cost reviews are labor intensive and require participation by the buying activities, contract
administration, and contract audit elements. The extent of availability of military department, contract administration,
and contract audit resources to support DCMC/DLA-led teams should be considered when determining whether a review
will be conducted. Overhead should-cost reviews generally shall not be conducted at a contractor business segment
more frequently than every three years.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of amendments to Fishery Management Plans and request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces that the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) has submitted Amendment 31 to the Fishery
Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and Amendment
35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) for Secretarial review and is requesting comments from the public.
These amendments would implement the Modified Block proposal, an action intended to discourage excessive consolidation
in the Pacific halibut and sablefish individual fishing quota (IFQ) program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon reviewing the plan or amendment, must immediately publish a notice that the plan or amendment is available for
public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received during the comment period in
determining whether to approve the plan or amendment.


Amendments 31 and 35 to the respective FMPs would implement the Modified Block proposal to the Pacific halibut and
sablefish IFQ program. These amendments would authorize the issuance of quota share (QS) blocks for QS that would
have resulted in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ based on the 1994 total allowable catch for fixed gear in the halibut
and sablefish fisheries, allow the combination of QS blocks that are less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut and
less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish, and restrict the amount of blocks that may be held in any one IFQ regulatory
area. These amendments are intended to prevent excessive consolidation of the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska, and are consistent with the management objectives of the Magnuson Act and the Northern Pacific Halibut
Act.

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the form of an amended tentative
final monograph that would establish conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) topical health-care antiseptic
drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. FDA is issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking to amend the previous notice of proposed rulemaking on topical antimicrobial drug products (see the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210) after considering the public comments on that notice and other information in the administrative
record for this rulemaking. FDA is also requesting data and information concerning the safety and effectiveness
of topical antimicrobials for use as hand sanitizers or dips. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug
products conducted by FDA.

 
</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), FDA published, under  330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, together with the recommendations
of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Topical Antimicrobial I Drug Products (Antimicrobial I Panel), which was the advisory
review panel responsible for evaluating data on the active ingredients in this drug class. Interested persons were
invited to submit comments by November 12, 1974. Reply comments in response to comments filed in the initial comment
period could be submitted by December 12, 1974. In response to numerous requests, the agency issued a notice in the


Federal Register

 of October 17, 1974 (39 FR 37066) granting an extension of the deadline for comments until December 12, 1974, and for
reply comments until January 13, 1975.

In the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), FDA published, under  330.10(a)(7), a notice of proposed rulemaking to establish
a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, based on the recommendations of the Antimicrobial I Panel
and the agency's response to comments submitted following publication of the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
Interested persons were invited to submit objections or requests for oral hearing by February 6, 1978. In response
to numerous requests to extend the time period for submitting objections or requests for oral hearing, the agency
issued a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of February 3, 1978 (43 FR 4637) granting an extension of the deadline to March 6, 1978. During this time period, the
agency received 6 petitions that requested reopening the administrative record and 11 requests for an oral hearing.
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1979 (44 FR 13041), the agency deferred action on the requests for a hearing, but granted the petitions to
reopen the record to allow interested persons to submit comments and any new or additional data by June 7, 1979, and
reply comments by July 9, 1979. FDA also stated its intent to publish an updated (amended) tentative final monograph
based on the review and evaluation of new submissions and a reevaluation of existing data. 
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 26, 1979 (44 FR 61609), the agency again reopened the administrative record for the submission of new data
by March 26, 1980, and for comments on the new data by May 27, 1980. This action was taken to permit manufacturers to submit
the results of testing to FDA as expeditiously as possible prior to establishment of a final monograph. 
Subsequent to the June 7, 1979, closing date for the submission of new data, and prior to the October 26, 1979, reopening
of the administrative record, data and information were submitted to FDA. In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 21, 1980 (45 FR 18398), the agency advised that it had reopened the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial
drug products to allow for consideration of data and information that had been filed in the Dockets Management Branch
after the date the administrative record on the tentative final monograph had officially closed on March 6, 1978.
The agency concluded that any new data and information filed prior to March 21, 1980, should be available to the agency
in developing a proposed regulation in the form of a tentative final monograph. 
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436), the agency advised that it had again reopened the administrative record for OTC topical
antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of the recommendations of the Advisory Review Panel on OTC
Miscellaneous External Drug Products (Miscellaneous External Panel) on mercury-containing drug products. Interested
persons were invited to submit comments by April 5, 1982, and reply comments by May 5, 1982. FDA stated that the proceeding
to develop a monograph for mercury-containing drug products would be merged with the general proceeding to establish
a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products. 
In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), the agency advised that it had again reopened the administrative record for OTC topical
antimicrobial drug products to allow for consideration of the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel
on alcohol drug products. Interested persons were invited to submit comments by August 19, 1982, and reply comments
by September 20, 1982. The notice stated that the proceeding to develop a monograph for alcohol drug products would
be merged with the general proceeding to establish a monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products.

In the 

Federal Register

 of September 7, 1982 (47 FR 39406), FDA issued a notice to reopen the administrative record for OTC topical antimicrobial
drug products to allow for consideration of the Miscellaneous External Panel's recommendations on topical antimicrobial
drug products used for the treatment of diaper rash. The agency discussed topical antimicrobial active ingredients
for this use in the 

Federal Register

 of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246). 
In accordance with  330.10(a)(10), the data and information considered by the Panels were put on public display
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above), after deletion of a small amount of trade secret information. In
response to the previous tentative final monograph and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for mercury-containing
drug products and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug products, 4 drug manufacturers' associations,
44 drug manufacturers, 1 medical device manufacturer, 1 drug distributor, 2 medical schools, 2 research laboratories,
1 law firm, and 1 consulting firm submitted comments. Copies of the comments received are also on public display in
the Dockets Management Branch. 
The advance notice of proposed rulemaking, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 13, 1974 (39 FR 33103), was designated as a ``proposed monograph'' in order to conform to terminology
used in the OTC drug review regulations ( 330.10). Similarly, the notice of proposed rulemaking, which was
published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), was designated as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The present document is also designated
as a ``tentative final monograph.'' The legal status of each tentative final monograph, however, is that of a proposed
rule. The present document is a reproposal regarding health-care antiseptic drug products. 
This antimicrobial rulemaking is broad in scope, encompassing products that may contain the same active ingredients,
but are labeled and marketed for different intended uses. For example, one group of products is primarily used by consumers
for ``first aid'' and includes skin antiseptics, skin wound cleansers, and skin wound protectants. Another group
of products, antiseptic handwashes, are used by consumers on a more frequent, even daily, basis and includes products
for personal use in the home, such as when caring for invalids and during family illness. A third group of products is
generally intended for use by health professionals and includes health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative
skin preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. 
In order to expedite the completion of the first aid section of the antimicrobial monograph, the agency published
a separate tentative final monograph for these products in the 

Federal Register

 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). The non-first aid uses of topical antimicrobials, now identified as ``health-care
antiseptics,'' are addressed in this document. Although the amended tentative final monographs for first-aid antiseptics
and health-care antiseptics are being published separately, both categories will eventually be included under
part 333 (21 CFR part 333).

The agency also has decided that OTC topical antimicrobial and topical antibiotic drug products should be included
within the same monograph. Although an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to establish a monograph for OTC topical
antibiotic drug products was published under part 342 (21 CFR part 342) on April 1, 1977 (42 FR 17642), the final monograph
for those products was issued on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47312) as a new subpart of the OTC topical antimicrobial monograph,
part 333, subpart B_Topical First Aid Antibiotic Drug Products. Subpart A will cover first aid antiseptic drug products;
subpart C will cover antifungal drug products; subpart D covers acne drug products; and new subpart E will cover health-care
antiseptic drug products. 
In this tentative final monograph (proposed rule) to establish subpart E of part 333, FDA states its position on the
establishment of a monograph for OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. This document addresses only those comments
and data concerning the previous antimicrobial tentative final monograph that are related to ``non-first aid uses,''
including products for personal use in the home and products used by health-care professionals. 
This proposal constitutes FDA's reevaluation of the January 6, 1978 tentative final monograph based on the comments
received and the agency's independent evaluation of the Miscellaneous External Panel's reports on OTC alcohol and
mercury-containing drug products and the comments received. The following sections of the January 6, 1978 tentative
final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products are being addressed in this document:   333.1,
333.3, 333.30, 333.50, 333.85, 333.87, 333.97, and 333.99. The following sections of the advance notice of proposed
rulemaking for alcohol drug products are being addressed in this document:   333.55 and 333.98. Modifications
have been made for clarity and regulatory accuracy and to reflect new information. Such new information has been placed
on file in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). These modifications are reflected in the following summary
of the comments and FDA's responses to them. (See section I.) 
The OTC drug procedural regulations (21 CFR 330.10) provide that any testing necessary to resolve the safety or effectiveness
issues that formerly resulted in a Category III classification, and submission to FDA of the results of that testing
or any other data, must be done during the OTC drug rulemaking process before the establishment of a final monograph.
Accordingly, FDA does not use the terms ``Category I'' (generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded),
``Category II'' (not generally recognized as safe and effective or misbranded), and ``Category III'' (available
data are insufficient to classify as safe and effective, and further testing is required) at the final monograph stage.
In place of Category I, the term ``monograph conditions'' is used; in place of Categories II and III, the term ``nonmonograph
conditions'' is used. This document retains the concepts of Categories I, II, and III at the tentative final monograph
stage. 
The agency advises that the conditions under which the drug products that are subject to this monograph would be generally
recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded (monograph conditions) will be effective 12 months after the
date of publication of the final monograph in the 

Federal Register

. On or after that date, no OTC drug product that is subject to the monograph and that contains a nonmonograph condition,
i.e., a condition that would cause the drug to be not generally recognized as safe and effective or to be misbranded,
may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it is the subject
of an approved application or abbreviated application (hereinafter called application). Further, any OTC drug
product subject to this monograph that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the monograph must be
in compliance with the monograph regardless of the date the product was initially introduced or initially delivered
for introduction into interstate commerce. Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the monograph
at the earliest possible date. 
In the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products (39 FR 33103), the agency
suggested that the conditions included in the monograph (Category I) be effective 30 days after the date of publication
of the final monograph in the 

Federal Register

 and that the conditions excluded from the monograph (Category II) be eliminated from OTC drug products effective
6 months after the date of publication of the final monograph, regardless of whether further testing was undertaken
to justify their future use. Experience has shown that relabeling of products covered by the monograph is necessary
in order for manufacturers to comply with the monograph. New labels containing the monograph labeling have to be written,
ordered, received, and incorporated into the manufacturing process. The agency has determined that it is impractical
to expect new labeling to be in effect 30 days after the date of publication of the final monograph. Experience has shown
also that if the deadline for relabeling is too short, the agency is burdened with extension requests and related paperwork.

In addition, some products will have to be reformulated to 
comply with the monograph. Reformulation often involves the need 
to do stability testing on the new product. An accelerated aging 
process may be used to test a new formulation; however, if the 
stability testing is not successful, and if further reformulation 
is required, there could be a further delay in having a new 
product available for manufacture. The agency wishes to 
establish a reasonable period of time for relabeling and 
reformulation in order to avoid an unnecessary disruption of the 
marketplace that could not only result in economic loss, but also 
interfere with consumers' access to safe and effective drug 
products. Therefore, the agency is proposing that the final 
monograph be effective 12 months after the date of its publication in the 

Federal Register

. The agency believes that 
within 12 months after the date of publication most manufacturers 
can order new labeling and reformulate their products and have 
them in compliance in the marketplace. If the agency determines 
that any labeling for a condition included in the final monograph 
should be implemented sooner than the 12-month effective date, a 
shorter deadline may be established. Similarly, if a safety 
problem is identified for a particular nonmonograph condition, a 
shorter deadline may be set for removal of that condition from 
OTC drug products. 

All ``OTC Volumes'' cited throughout this document refer to 
the submissions made by interested persons pursuant to the 
call-for-data notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of 
January 7, 1972 (37 FR 235) or to additional information that has 
come to the agency's attention since publication of the advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking. The volumes are on public display 
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). 



I. The Agency's Tentative Conclusions on the Comments and Reply Comments



A. General Comments 



1. Two comments contended that OTC drug monographs are 
interpretive, as opposed to substantive, regulations. One 
comment referred to statements on this issue submitted earlier to 
other OTC drug rulemaking proceedings. 

The agency addressed this issue in paragraphs 85 through 91 
of the preamble to the procedures for classification of OTC drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 11, 1972 (37 
FR 9464 at 9471 to 9472), and in paragraph 3 of the preamble to 
the tentative final monograph for OTC antacid drug products, 
published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 
31260). FDA reaffirms the conclusions stated in those documents. 
Court decisions have confirmed the agency's authority to issue 
substantive regulations by rulemaking. (See, e.g., 

National 
Nutritional Foods Association 

v. 

Weinberger, 

512 F.2d 688, 696 to 
698 (2d Cir. 1975) and 

National Association of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers 

v. 

FDA, 

487 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), aff'd, 
637 F.2d 887 (2d Cir. 1981).) 

2. One comment pointed out that under ``Subpart B_Active 
Ingredients'' of the tentative final monograph, no CFR part number 
was assigned to the category ``skin antiseptic.'' However, part 
numbers were assigned to other categories without any Category I 
ingredients, with the term ``reserved'' in parentheses. The 
comment requested that this omission be corrected in the amended 
tentative final monograph. 

The omission pointed out by the comment was an oversight. 
However, it is no longer necessary to assign a CFR part number to 
the category ``skin antiseptic,'' because skin antiseptics have 
been included in broader categories identified as first aid 
antiseptics in the amended tentative final monograph for first 
aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644) and as health-care antiseptics in 
this tentative final monograph. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 
All Category I first aid antiseptic and health-care antiseptic 
active ingredients have been listed in the amended tentative 
final monograph under subpart A and subpart E, respectively. 



B. General Comments on Antimicrobials 



3. A number of comments objected to the Panel's 
recommendation for separate statements of identity in the 
labeling of products containing the same antimicrobial active 
ingredient. As an example, several comments noted that 
povidone-iodine has several professional uses (health-care 
personnel handwash, skin antiseptic, and surgical hand scrub) and 
marketing a product in conformance with two or more product 
categories becomes difficult because there are different labeling 
requirements for each drug product category. Some comments 
requested FDA to combine the drug product category designations 
or to add a new multipurpose product category that allows the 
combining of labeling indications now included in several product 
categories. One comment specifically recommended that the agency 
consider changing product class designations and/or adding a new 
product class ``Multi Purpose Skin Prep'' or ``Skin Prep,'' with the 
indications for use including those listed under  333.85 
(health-care personnel hand wash),  333.87 (patient preoperative 
skin preparation),  333.90 (skin antiseptic), and  333.97 
(surgical hand scrub). 

Another comment stated that the word ``skin'' was superfluous 
because all OTC antiseptics are intended only for use on the 
skin; still another comment contended that the statement of 
identity ``antiseptic'' is preferable to ``skin antiseptic'' because 
these products are used on cuts, scratches, and mucous membranes 
as well as skin.

In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking and 
reopening of the administrative record for alcohol drug products 
for topical antimicrobial OTC use published in the 

Federal 
Register

 of May 21, 1982 (47 FR 22324), one comment objected to 
the statement of identity in proposed  333.98(a) which read, 
``alcohol for topical antimicrobial use,'' (47 FR 22324 at 22332). 
The comment stated that this term would be confusing to the 
consumer and suggested the term ``antiseptic for the skin.'' 
The agency agrees that OTC topical antimicrobial drug 
products need not have multiple statements of identity. In 
reviewing the statements of identity recommended by the 
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33103), i.e., health-care personnel 
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, 
surgical hand scrub, and the statement of identity recommended by 
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 22324), i.e., alcohol for 
topical antimicrobial use, the agency has determined that the 
general term ``antiseptic'' broadly describes all proposed product 
categories and reflects the basic intended uses of these 
products. The agency believes that the statement of identity of 
``multiple purpose skin prep'' or ``skin prep'' recommended by one 
comment would not as clearly and succinctly describe the use of 
these products as the statement of identity ``antiseptic.'' As 
discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the agency is also proposing an additional term ``antiseptic handwash'' as
a statement 
of identity to describe products for home use. 

As discussed in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the term ``skin'' has been 
deleted from the previously proposed statement of identity ``skin 
antiseptic.'' Although several comments felt that the word ``skin'' 
was superfluous, the agency has no objection to the statement 
``antiseptic for the skin'' or ``skin antiseptic'' appearing 
elsewhere in the labeling of these products as additional 
information to the consumer or health-care professional, provided 
it does not appear in any portion of the labeling required by the 
monograph and does not detract from such required information. 
(See section I.I., comment 19.) 

As stated in the first aid antiseptic segment of this 
rulemaking (56 FR 33644 at 33647), the agency believes that the 
term ``antiseptic'' is readily understood by consumers. The agency 
also finds this to be true for health professionals. The agency 
is therefore proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general 
statement of identity for all OTC topical antimicrobial 
ingredients included in this tentative final monograph. Further, 
FDA is also proposing that manufacturers may have an option to 
provide an alternate statement of identity describing only the 
specific intended use(s) of the product. Specifically, the 
agency is proposing that the statement of identity for antiseptic 
drug products in  333.450(a) read as follows: ``The labeling of 
a single-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product as an `antiseptic'
and/or with 
the appropriate statement of identity described in   333.455(a), 
333.460(a), or 333.465(a). The labeling of a multiple-use 
product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and 
may use the single statement of identity `antiseptic' and/or the 
appropriate statements of identity described in   333.455(a), 
333.460(a), and 333.465(a). When `antiseptic' is used as the 
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use 
product, the intended use(s), such as patient preoperative skin 
preparation, is to be included under the indications. For 
multiple-use products, a statement of the intended use should 
also precede the specific directions for each use.'' 

The agency believes that the proposed labeling for these 
multiple-use products is flexible and provides manufacturers with 
a number of options. However, the agency recognizes that some 
manufacturers may wish to label their antiseptic drug products 
with all of the allowable indications for a particular active 
ingredient and that this may give rise to difficulties in 
incorporating all of the information on a product's various uses 
in the limited space on an OTC label. The agency wishes to point 
out that some portions of the proposed indications are optional, 
i.e., the examples included in both the antiseptic and health-care personnel handwash indications, and need not
be incorporated 
in the labeling at all. In addition, manufacturers are free to 
design ways of incorporating all the information on the various 
uses of their drug product through the use of flap labels, 
redesigned packages, or package inserts.

The agency is providing several examples of labeling for an 
antiseptic product containing povidone-iodine when labeled as a 
single-use or as a multiple-use product, as follows: 

1. When labeled as a single-use product, i.e., patient 
preoperative skin preparation. 

a. Established name: povidone-iodine. 

b. Statement of identity (any of these is acceptable): 

(1) ``antiseptic''; 

(2) ``patient preoperative skin preparation''; 

(3) ``antiseptic/patient preoperative skin preparation.'' 

c. Indications: 

(1) When only ``antiseptic'' is used in the statement of 
identity: 

``Patient preoperative skin preparation: 

Helps to reduce bacteria that potentially can cause skin 
infection.'' 

(2) When patient preoperative skin preparation is used as 
or included as part of the statement of identity: ``Helps to 
reduce bacteria that potentially can cause skin infection.'' 

d. Directions: (Insert directions in  333.460(d).) 

2. When labeled as a multiple-use product, i.e., patient 
preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or health-care 
personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub. 

a. Established name: povidone-iodine. 

b. Statement of identity (any of these is acceptable): 

(1) ``antiseptic''; 

(2) ``patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic 
handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand 
scrub''; 

(3) ``antiseptic/patient preoperative skin preparation, 
antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and 
surgical hand scrub.'' 

c. Indications: Irrespective of which statement of 
identity is used, the following is required: ``Patient 
preoperative skin preparation: Helps to reduce bacteria that 
potentially can cause skin infection. Antiseptic handwash: For 
handwashing to reduce bacteria on the skin (which may be followed 
by one or more of the following: after changing diapers, after 
assisting ill persons, or before contact with a person under 
medical care or treatment). Health-care personnel handwash: 
Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause 
disease or For handwashing to reduce bacteria on the skin (which 
may be followed by one or more of the following: after changing 
diapers, after assisting ill persons, or before contact with a 
person under medical care or treatment). Surgical hand scrub: 
Significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on the hands 
and forearms prior to surgery or patient care.'' 

d. Directions: The following is required: Patient 
preoperative skin preparation: (Insert directions in 
 333.460(d).) Antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
handwash: (Insert directions in  333.455(c).) Surgical

4. One comment requested that scrubbing devices such as 
brushes or sponges that are impregnated with approved 
antimicrobial ingredients be included in the monograph. Another 
comment requested clarification of the agency's views on trays or 
kits that contain povidone-iodine and disposable instruments 
(scissors, forceps, and hemostats) packed in a sterile package, 
which are designed to reduce the incidence of cross-infection in 
hospitals. 

This tentative final monograph does not provide for the use 
of devices such as brushes or sponges impregnated with 
antimicrobials, or of trays or kits that contain povidone-iodine 
and disposable instruments, because the monograph is intended to 
regulate only OTC drug active ingredients. Since these comments 
were submitted, the agency has established procedures (see 21 CFR 
part 3) describing how it determines which agency component has 
primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of 
products comprised of any combination of a drug and a device. In 
addition, interested parties are encouraged to read the following 
document (Ref. 1) for guidance: ``Intercenter Agreement Between 
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health.'' (See  3.5 (21 CFR 3.5).) 
This agreement is on file in the Dockets Management Branch 
(address above).

Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and 
the Center for Devices and Radiological 
Health in OTC Vol. 230001, Docket No. 75N-
183H, Dockets Management Branch. 

5. One comment expressed concern that the tentative final 
monograph failed to provide consumers with an antibacterial skin 
cleanser for home use. The comment noted that, in addition to 
professional health care personnel, many consumers have a need 
for cleansing products containing antibacterial agents for the 
purpose of promoting good individual and family hygiene. Uses 
for such products include the following: (1) To reduce bacteria 
on the hands and face to a greater extent than can be 
accomplished with ordinary soap, and to prevent accumulation of 
bacteria from potential sources of contamination. The following 
examples were cited: Cleansing oneself after changing a baby's 
diaper, or after assisting aged or ill members of the household 
with their toilet needs, and before preparing a family meal. 
(2) The added benefit of an antibacterial cleanser for the 
minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and other minor traumas. 
(3) The need for an antibacterial cleanser other than bar soap 
on local parts of the body such as the face because soap (alkali 
salts of fatty acids) can be irritating or too drying for some 
individuals' needs. The comment recommended a new product class 
under proposed  333.90(a) (skin antiseptic) to be identified as 
``Antimicrobial (or Antibacterial) Personal Cleanser'' with claims such as ``decreases bacteria on the skin''
and ``contains an 
antibacterial agent.'' The comment also suggested that the 10-day 
maximum use limitation would not be appropriate for this product 
class, but use could be restricted to 5 or 10 times daily. 

Another comment recommended that antimicrobial soaps be 
allowed to make claims relating to general health care and 
personal hygiene similar to the claims allowed for health-care 
personnel handwashes. The comment stated that an antimicrobial 
soap will reduce bacteria or the transfer of potentially 
pathogenic micro-organisms in the home and, therefore, serves as 
a preventive health care aid in controlling diseases. 

A third comment requested the addition of a fourth 
indication for alcohol active ingredients in proposed  333.98(b) 
to allow use as an antibacterial handwash to avoid 
cross-contamination from one individual to another. The comment 
argued that products containing alcohols are often used as 
handwashes by athletic trainers to help prevent the spread of 
skin infections from one individual to another in situations in 
which soap and water are not available, e.g., on the playing 
field. 

A fourth comment asserted that numerous other meaningful and 
truthful indications can be used which enhance the safe and 
effective use of a health-care personnel handwash. For example, 
the terms ``microbicidal cleanser'' or ``antiseptic germicidal skin 
cleanser'' are appropriate and meaningful terminology describing 
this use indication.

The agency agrees that antibacterial or antiseptic personal 
cleanser products are practical for home use, to help prevent 
cross contamination from one person to another, especially after 
diaper changing and caring for invalids or ill family members. 
The agency also agrees with one comment that claims relating to 
general health-care and personal hygiene similar to the claims 
allowed for health-care personnel handwashes may be suitable 
because such claims explain the uses of these products in lay 
terms. 

In the 

Federal Register

 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), the 
agency separated the first aid antiseptic uses of OTC topical 
antimicrobial drug products from the ``non-first aid uses.'' In 
that document, the agency proposed that the following terms and 
categories be deleted: skin antiseptics, skin wound protectants, 
and skin wound cleansers; and the agency proposed that the 
appropriate labeling, instead, be included in a new category 
called ``first aid antiseptics'' (56 FR 33644 at 33649). Several 
uses proposed by one comment, i.e., ``minute cuts and abrasions 
from shaving and other minor traumas,'' are considered as 
describing ``first aid uses'' and are adequately covered by the 
labeling provided for ``first aid antiseptics'' in proposed 
 333.50(b) (56 FR 33677), which contains the following: ``First 
aid to help'' (select one of the following: ``prevent,'' 
(``decrease'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), (``reduce'' (``the risk of'' or ``the chance of'')), ``guard
against,'' or ``protect 
against'') (select one of the following: ``infection,'' ``bacterial 
contamination,'' or ``skin infection'') ``in minor cuts, scrapes, and 
burns.'' The agency believes that the first aid indication is 
sufficiently broad to cover minute cuts and abrasions from 
shaving and that it is not necessary to include the words ``other 
minor traumas'' in the indications statement. 

Beyond the first aid uses described in the first comment, 
the agency recognizes a need for an OTC ``antiseptic handwash'' 
product for repeated or daily use over an extended period of time 
for some of the other uses described by the comment. The agency 
agrees with the comments that health-care personnel handwashes 
are appropriate for such use because submitted data from 
effectiveness studies, for uses subject to this rulemaking, were 
derived from handwashing tests similar to or the same as tests 
described in the agency's previously proposed testing guidelines 
(see 43 FR 1210 at 1240), i.e., ``Modified Cade Procedure,'' ``Glove 
Juice Test,'' and ``Test for Health-Care Personnel Handwash 
Effectiveness.'' The agency is proposing in this tentative final 
monograph in  333.455(a) that a health-care personnel handwash 
can also bear a statement of identity of ``antiseptic handwash.'' 
(See section I.B., comment 3.) For products labeled for multiple 
uses including both antiseptic handwash and first aid labeling 
claims, the general statement of identity would be ``antiseptic'' 
as described in section I.B., comment 3. The product would then 
need to incorporate the monograph labeling for both antiseptic 
handwash as well as first aid antiseptic. 

The term ``cleanser'' included in claims requested by the 
comments is not appropriate in this rulemaking because it is 
considered to be a cosmetic claim in view of the fact that the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) defines a cosmetic 
as ``articles intended to be * * * applied to the human body * * * 
for cleansing * * *'' (21 U.S.C. 321(i)(1)) and thus may be 
misleading to consumers. As discussed in section I.I., comment 
19, the terms ``microbicidal'' and ``germicidal'' may appear in the 
labeling of OTC antiseptic drug products under certain 
conditions. 

Accordingly, the agency is proposing as the indication for 
products bearing the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' 
a general claim similar to one recommended by one of the 
comments, i.e., ``for handwashing to decrease bacteria on the 
skin.'' The agency has determined that this claim may, at the 
manufacturer's option, be followed by one or more of the 
following examples: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting 
ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under medical care 
or treatment.'' 

Descriptive statements such as ``contains antibacterial 
ingredients'' and ``for the purpose of promoting good individual 
and family hygiene'' are considered to be examples of statements 
not significantly related to the safe and effective use of the product and thus are outside the scope of the rulemaking.
Such 
statements may be included in the labeling of these OTC drug 
products subject to the statutory provisions against false or 
misleading labeling. 

The agency has determined that the indication proposed for 
antiseptic handwash drug products is also appropriate for health-care personnel handwashes and is also proposing
the following 
indication for health-care personnel handwashes. ``For handwashing 
to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one 
or more of the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after 
assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under 
medical care or treatment.'') In addition to the indication 
proposed above, the agency is proposing that health-care 
personnel handwashes may also bear the following indication: 
``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can cause 
disease.'' The agency is proposing the statement ``recommended for 
repeated use'' as an ``other allowable indication'' for antiseptic 
or health-care personnel handwash drug products (see below). 

The agency sees no reason to continue to include 
``antimicrobial soap'' as a separate product category. Soap is 
considered to be a dosage form, and specific dosage forms are not 
being included in the monograph unless there is a particular 
safety or efficacy reason for doing so. Antimicrobial 
ingredients may be formulated as soaps for some of the uses 
discussed in this document, e.g., handwash; however, the designation ``antimicrobial soap'' is no longer being
proposed for 
inclusion in the monograph. In addition, the agency considers 
the other product categories that are being proposed to be more 
informative to the users of these products. 

Based upon the comments, the agency is proposing labeling 
appropriate for professional or consumer uses as follows: 



Section 333.455 Labeling of Antiseptic Handwash or Health-Care 
Personnel Handwash Drug Products. 



(a) 

Statement of identity. 

The labeling of the product 
contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies 
the product as an ``antiseptic,'' as stated above under 
 333.450(a), and/or ``antiseptic handwash,'' or ``health-care 
personnel handwash.'' 

(b) 

Indications. * * * 

(1) For products labeled as a health-care personnel 
handwash. 

``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially can 
cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the 
skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of the following: 
``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or 
``before contact with a person under medical care or treatment.'')

(2) 

For products labeled as an antiseptic handwash. 

``For 
handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be 
followed by one or more of the following: ``after changing 
diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with 
a person under medical care or treatment.'')

(3) 

Other allowable indications for products labeled as 
either antiseptic or health-care personnel handwash. 

The 
labeling of the product may also contain the following phrase: 
``Recommended for repeated use.'' 

Other labeling claims requested by the comments for first 
aid antiseptics are not being included in the tentative final 
monograph. The agency believes that the general claim ``for 
handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' encompasses the 
variety of uses for promoting good individual and family hygiene. 
The agency tentatively concludes that the labeling statements 
proposed above express the same concepts as the labeling 
suggested by the comments in language that can be more readily 
understood by the consumer. 



C. Comments on Definitions 



6. One comment objected to a portion of the definition for 
health-care personnel handwash in  333.3(d) of the tentative 
final monograph that states that the antimicrobial agent is 
``broad-spectrum'' and ``if possible, persistent.'' The comment 
argued that, because these handwashes are used 50 to 100 times 
daily, persistence of effect is unnecessary. The comment also 
questioned the need for a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, stating 
that 

Staphylococcus epidermidis 

(

S. epidermidis

) generally is the 
only natural resident bacteria on the skin, and other transient 
micro-organisms are more likely to be removed mechanically by 
washing than by antimicrobial action. The comment suggested that 
the choice to use or not to use a broad-spectrum antimicrobial 
ingredient should be left to the manufacturer. 

Another comment pointed out that the requirement for ``broad 
spectrum'' activity is inconsistently applied in the definitions 
for health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
preparation, and surgical hand scrub ( 333.3(d), (e), and (i), 
respectively) because ``broad spectrum'' activity is mandatory for 
the first two classes and only ``desirable'' for surgical hand 
scrubs. The comment cited comment 93 (43 FR 1210 at 1224) and 
the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness of OTC 
topical antimicrobials (43 FR 1239) to show the agency's 
awareness of possible shifts in microbial flora due to a lack of 
broad spectrum activity. The comment urged that all three 
product classes include the requirement for each product to at 
least demonstrate in vitro ``cidal'' activity against gram-negative 
bacteria, fungi, and lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses in 
addition to the gram-positive activity. 

In  333.3(d) of the previous tentative final monograph, a 
health-care personnel handwash was defined as an ``* * * 
antimicrobial-containing preparation designed for frequent use; 
it reduces the number of transient micro-organisms on intact skin 
to an initial baseline level after adequate washing, rinsing, and 
drying, and it is broad-spectrum, fast acting, and, if possible, 
persistent.'' In the tentative final monograph, the agency agreed 
with the Panel that persistence, defined as prolonged activity, is a valuable attribute that assures antimicrobial
activity 
during the interval between washings and is important to a safe 
and effective health-care personnel handwash (43 FR 1215). The 
Panel explained that a property such as persistence, which acts 
to prevent the growth or establishment of transient micro-organisms as part of the normal baseline or resident flora,
would be an added benefit (39 FR 33103 at 33115). Although the Panel 
did not propose persistence as a mandatory requirement for a 
health-care personnel handwash, the agency is retaining the words 
``if possible, persistent'' in the definition in this amended 
tentative final monograph because this is a desirable trait for 
these products. 

Regarding the comment's objection to the broad-spectrum 
requirement, the Panel in its discussion of the normal skin flora 
stated that the predominant members of the normal flora are gram 
positive cocci and diptheroids and not 

S. epidermidis,

 as the 
comment indicates. The Panel stated further that a small number 
of gram negative species, such as coliforms and related micro-
organisms, as well as higher forms such as yeast may also be 
residents of the skin of healthy individuals (39 FR 33103 at 
33107). In its discussion of health-care personnel handwash drug 
products, the Panel acknowledged that, in all likelihood, the 
specified effect of these products (i.e., removal of transient 
micro-organisms) can be achieved with a well formulated 
nonantimicrobial soap or detergent product. However, the Panel concluded that transient micro-organisms may become
part of the 
established ``resident'' flora with time, and stated that in a 
health-care situation, the fast, effective removal of transient 
micro-organisms is a requirement because they may be pathogenic 
(39 FR 33103 at 33115). The Panel recommended that health-care 
personnel handwash drug products containing an antimicrobial 
ingredient should be broad spectrum. The Panel defined ``broad 
spectrum'' in reference to microbiological activity as meaning the 
antimicrobial has activity against more than one type of micro-
organism, that is, activity against gram positive and gram 
negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses (39 FR 33115). Because 
transient micro-organisms present on the skin may include widely 
diverse species, resulting from contact with contaminated persons 
and materials, the agency concludes that a greater reduction of 
transient micro-organisms on the skin can be achieved if the 
antimicrobial containing drug product used as a health-care 
personnel handwash provides broad spectrum activity.

In addition, because the principal intended use of these professional use products is the prevention of nosocomial
(hospital acquired) infections, the agency believes that these drug products should have demonstrable antimicrobial
activity against a microbial spectrum that includes the micro-organisms associated with these infections. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing, in  333.470(a)(1)(ii) of the testing requirements, a
list of micro-organisms that reflects a spectrum of antimicrobial activity pertinent to the intended use of these
drug products and against which the products must be tested. The agency is proposing the following definition of broad
spectrum activity in  333.403(b) of this amended tentative final monograph: ``

Broad spectrum activity

. A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in  333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology in  333.470(a)(1)(ii).'' This methodology
has been developed by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Although micro-organisms
in addition to those listed may also be used for testing, the agency will use the test micro-organisms identified in
 333.470(a)(1)(ii) for any necessary compliance testing. 

The agency wants to emphasize that in this amended tentative final monograph the broad-spectrum criterion applies
to final-formulated drug products used as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. Although the Category I active ingredients currently included in this
amended tentative final monograph are broad spectrum independent of formulation, some Category III antiseptic
ingredients have limited spectra (activity against only gram positive bacteria; for example, chloroxylenol (see
section I.G., comment 12) and triclosan (see section I.L., comment 23)), but when properly formulated in a final product
the spectrum can be broadened to include additional activity against the test micro-organisms, thereby possibly
enabling these ingredients to become Category I. Although the agency agrees with the first comment that the manufacturer
may use or not use a broad-spectrum ingredient in a particular health-care antiseptic drug product, the finished
product must demonstrate in vitro activity against the specific micro-organisms listed in proposed  333.470(a)(1)(ii).


In response to the second comment, that broad spectrum was inconsistently applied in the definitions of the three
product classes, the agency has reevaluated the issue and believes that all product classes should be broad spectrum.
As stated in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), maintaining the balance among species of micro-organisms
constituting the normal skin flora is more likely to be threatened by use of antimicrobial products with a limited
spectrum. Also much of the data concerning the spread of infections in hospitals indicates that the use of an antimicrobial
with broad spectrum activity would help prevent this (see section I.D., comment 9). Based on the reasons mentioned
above, the agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included
in this tentative final monograph.

D. Comments on Labeling 



7. Several comments contended that FDA does not have the authority to restrict OTC labeling claims to exact wording,
to the exclusion of what the comments described as other ``equally truthful claims for the products.'' One comment
pointed out that numerous other meaningful and truthful statements will provide useful information and will enhance
the safe and effective use of these products. Several comments maintained that manufacturers have a constitutional
right to use any truthful, nonmisleading labeling under the first amendment. To support their position, the comments
cited

 v. 

Federal Trade Commission

, 562 F.2d 749 at 768 (D.C. Cir. 1977). 

In the 

Federal Register

 of May 1, 1986 (51 FR 16258), the agency published a final rule changing its labeling policy for stating the indications
for use of OTC drug products. Under 21 CFR 330.1(c)(2), the label and labeling of OTC drug products are required to contain
in a prominent and conspicuous location, either (1) the specific wording on indications for use established under
an OTC drug monograph, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES''; (2) other wording describing
such indications for use that meets the statutory prohibitions against false or misleading labeling, which shall
neither appear within a boxed area nor be designated ``APPROVED USES''; or (3) the approved monograph language on
indications, which may appear within a boxed area designated ``APPROVED USES,'' plus alternative language describing
indications for use that is not false or misleading, which shall appear elsewhere in the labeling. All other OTC drug
labeling required by a monograph or other regulation (e.g., statement of identity, warnings, and directions) must
appear in the specific wording established under the OTC drug monograph or other regulation where exact language
has been established and identified by quotation marks, e.g., 21 CFR 201.63 or 330.1(g). 

In the previous tentative final monograph, supplemental language relating to indications had been proposed and
captioned as 

Other Allowable Statements

 in   333.85, 333.87 and 333.97. Under FDA's revised labeling policy (51 FR 16258), such statements are
included at the tentative final stage as examples of other truthful and nonmisleading language that would be allowed
elsewhere in the labeling. In accordance with the revised labeling policy, such statements would not be included
in a final monograph.

In preparing this amended tentative final monograph, the 
agency has reevaluated these ``other allowable statements'' to 
determine whether they should be incorporated, wherever possible, 
as part of the indications developed under the monograph. 

The agency has reviewed the ``

Other Allowable Statements

'' 
proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in  333.85 
for health-care personnel handwash, in  333.87 for patient 
preoperative skin preparation, and in  333.97 for surgical hand 
scrub. The statement ``recommended for repeated use'' proposed for 
a health-care personnel handwash has been included in this 
amended tentative final monograph as an ``other allowable 
indication'' in proposed  333.455 for antiseptic handwash or 
health-care personnel handwash drug products. (See section I.B., 
comment 5.) 

The terms ``broad spectrum'' and ``fast-acting'' (if applicable) 
were proposed as ``

Other Allowable Statements

'' for all three of 
these product classes in the previous tentative final monograph. 
As discussed in section I.C., comment 6, the agency is proposing 
to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definition of the three 
product classes included in this amended tentative final 
monograph. Although the term ``broad spectrum'' is included in the 
definitions of these product classes, the agency does not see a 
need to include this information in the ``indications'' for these 
products. Likewise, the term ``fast-acting'' is included in the definitions of these product classes, but the agency
does not see 
a need to include this information in the indications for these 
products. This type of information may appear elsewhere in the 
labeling of these products as additional information to the 
health-care professional, provided it does not appear in any 
portion of the labeling required by the monograph and does not 
detract from such required information. Other previously 
proposed ``

Other Allowable Statements

,'' i.e., ``contains 
antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial 
ingredient(s),'' and ``nonirritating,'' are not related in a 
significant way to the safe and effective use of these products. 
The agency does not believe that statements such as ``contains 
antibacterial ingredient(s)'' or ``contains antimicrobial 
ingredient(s)'' are necessary on products intended primarily for 
health professionals, but has no objection to such statements 
appearing in the labeling as other information not intertwined 
with any portion of the labeling required by the monograph. 
Likewise, the term ``nonirritating'' may appear as additional 
information to the health-care professional, provided it does not 
appear in any portion of the labeling required by the monograph 
and does not detract from such required information. However, 
such statements are subject to the provisions of section 502 of 
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
misleading. Such statements will be evaluated on a product-by- 
product basis, under the provisions of section 502 of the act 
relating to labeling that is false or misleading.

8. Several comments requested that certain warnings 
required in the labeling of OTC drug products marketed for the 
general public should not be required on such products 
distributed only to health professionals and labeled primarily 
for use in health-care facilities as in proposed  333.99 
``Professional labeling'' (43 FR 1210 at 1248 and 1249). Examples 
cited were the cautionary statements for ``skin antiseptic'' and 
``skin wound protectant'' in proposed   333.90(c)(3) and 
333.93(c)(3) ``Do not use this product for more than 10 days. If 
the infection (condition) worsens or persists, see your 
physician,'' and for ``skin wound protectant'' in proposed 
 333.93(c)(7) ``Do not use on chronic skin conditions such as leg 
ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema.'' The comments stated that 
the professional use of these products sometimes differs from 
consumer use and that products which are marketed only to 
health-care institutions and are dispensed and administered by 
professionals should only contain warnings that apply to 
professional use. One comment concluded that requiring 
professional labeling to contain a caution such as in proposed 
 333.93(c)(7) could possibly subject the health-care facility 
and the physician to unwarranted product liability claims, 
although the particular use of the product under medical 
supervision is entirely justified and necessary for proper 
treatment of the patient. One of the comments stated that flexibility should be provided so that manufacturers can
utilize 
only those warnings that are appropriate for professional 
personnel when packages are restricted to health-care facilities 
or where a topical antimicrobial product is used as part of a 
course of treatment selected by the clinician. 

In the 

Federal Register

 of November 12, 1973 (38 FR 31260), 
the agency published the tentative final monograph for OTC 
antacid drug products, in which the concept of ethical labeling 
for OTC drug products was first discussed in comment 56 at 38 FR 
31264. There, the agency stated that the warning statements 
appearing on OTC drug products should be included in ethical 
(professional) labeling. 

Subsequently, in the previous tentative final monograph for 
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1978 (43 FR 1210), the agency proposed 
 333.99 (``Professional labeling'') which stated that the labeling 
of products (covered by the monograph) that is provided only to 
health professionals and the labeling for those products 
primarily used in health-care facilities shall include all of the 
warnings required in each subsection of the monograph, e.g., 
those in  333.90 for ``skin antiseptic'' or  333.93 for ``skin 
wound protectant.'' 

As described in the first aid antiseptic segment of the 
tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial drug products, 
published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644), 
the agency has proposed deletion of the categories cited by the 
comments, i.e., ``skin antiseptic'' and ``skin wound protectant,'' as 
separate drug categories and included them in a single drug 
product category identified as ``first aid antiseptic.'' The 
cautionary statements referred to by the comments are addressed 
in that document. 

In this document, the agency is addressing the uses other 
than first-aid, i.e., health-care antiseptic uses, of topical 
antimicrobial drug products. These products may contain the same 
antiseptic active ingredient(s) as the first aid antiseptic drug 
products, but they are labeled and marketed for different uses. 
The cautionary statements previously proposed in   333.90(c)(3) 
and 333.93(c)(3) addressed short-term first aid uses of products 
primarily proposed as ``consumer products.'' These products were 
not principally intended to be marketed for hospital or 
professional use. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comments 
that such cautionary statements do not apply to professional use 
of antiseptic drug products and need not appear in the labeling 
of antiseptic products marketed as antiseptic handwashes or 
health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin 
preparations, and surgical hand scrubs. Likewise the agency 
believes that health-care antiseptic drug products, marketed 
principally to health-care professionals, do not need to bear a 
cautionary statement not to use the product on chronic skin 
conditions such as leg ulcers, diaper rash, or hand eczema. As the comment pointed out, professional use of these products
is 
different than consumer use and, in some instances, use of the 
product on the above-mentioned skin conditions under medical 
supervision may be justified and necessary for proper treatment 
of the patient. Therefore, this cautionary statement is not 
being included in this tentative final monograph.

This tentative final monograph addresses specifically the use of these topical antiseptic drug products by health-care
professionals and in health-care facilities. The labeling proposed for those products in this document represents
that labeling which the agency believes health-care professionals need to properly use these products. Therefore,
the agency believes that the warnings proposed in  333.450(c) of this tentative final monograph should appear
in the labeling of these products that are directed to health-care professionals and health-care facilities, even
if the product is marketed principally to these sources only. However, the agency believes that one of these warnings
can be modified if the product is labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In such cases, the second sentence
of the warning proposed in  333.450(c)(3), regarding consulting a doctor, can be deleted. This concept is being
included in this tentative final monograph. (See  333.450(d).) 

In responding to the comments regarding the warnings in the ``Professional labeling'' section ( 333.99) of
the previous tentative final monograph, the agency has determined that these warnings are no longer necessary. Accordingly,
 333.99 is not being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See section I.D., comment 9 for discussion
of  333.99(a), and section I.J., comment 21 for discussion of  333.99(b). Also, see section II.B., paragraph
14 in the first aid antiseptic segment of this tentative final monograph (56 FR 33644 at 33675) for discussion of  333.99(c).)


9. Several comments made recommendations regarding the requirement that professional labeling for all classes
of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products must contain the caution statement in proposed  333.99(a), ``Caution:
Overuse of this and other antimicrobial products may result in an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms,
particularly 

Pseudomonas

.'' Some of the comments stated that this caution statement should be required only for antimicrobials where there
is valid scientific evidence to show that such caution is appropriate, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds
and triclosan, which have been associated with the overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms, specifically


Pseudomonas

. Three comments contended that reports of contamination of benzalkonium chloride solutions with 

Pseudomonas

 and 

Enterobacteria

 species were basically the result of misuse, improper storage and dilution, poor technique, and contamination with
neutralizing chemicals. One comment recommended that the proposed caution statement in  333.99(a) should
be changed to read: ``Improper use or overuse * * *.'' and cited the discussion of the proposed warning
for quaternary ammonium compounds by the agency at 43 FR 1237 where the phrase ``misuse or overuse'' was included.
Another comment objected to the caution, arguing that it is based on theoretical considerations only and there is
no published clinical evidence implicating quaternary ammonium compounds. Still another comment stated that its
quaternary ammonium compound product passed the commonly used test for 

Pseudomonas

 activity. 

In defense of triclosan's implication in 

Pseudomonas

 overgrowth, one comment argued that overgrowth was just an unproven hypothesis and submitted the ``Summary for Basis
of Approval'' from an approved new drug application (NDA) for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) which included data
on a skin flora study that indicated an increasing, continuous gram-negative growth only in the axillary area over
a 6-month period, even though chlorhexidine is active against gram-negative micro-organisms. The comment referred
to FDA's Division of Anti-Infective Drug Products as having recognized that gram-negative overgrowth can be adequately
controlled by restricting use to indications provided in the labeling of a product. 

Several comments pointed out that data on povidone-iodine have proven broad spectrum effectiveness, referring
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation (Ref. 2) for using this ingredient for skin
preparation before intravenous catheter insertion and other procedures to reduce infection. The comments also
noted that in a study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3), in which 20 transfers of 7 gram-negative micro-organisms (including


Pseudomonas aeruginosa

 (

P.

 

aeruginosa

)) were made, the minimum inhibitory concentration did not change, supporting the fact that repeated use of povidone-iodine
would not result in resistant micro-organisms. For these reasons, these comments recommended that  333.99(a)
should be revised to exclude povidone-iodine. 

After a thorough review and evaluation of the available data, the agency concludes that the professional labeling
caution that overuse of an antimicrobial drug product may cause an overgrowth of gram-negative micro-organisms
is not necessary. In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1212), the agency stated its awareness of
the theory that gram-negative bacteria will replace gram-positive bacteria that are reduced in number or eliminated
by use of antimicrobials and encouraged research to test the validity of the theory. The agency also recalled the Panel's
highlighting the need for research on microbial ecology of the skin and its concern about the effect of overuse of antimicrobial
drug products, especially products with a limited spectrum, in hospitals and other closed populations. Therefore,
the agency proposed the professional labeling caution in  333.99(a) ``for certain antimicrobial ingredients
approved for OTC drug use * * * used in health-care facilities'' (43 FR 1213). However, the agency concluded
that the limited consumer use of these products in the population at large did not constitute a risk that would warrant
such a label warning. Although benzalkonium chloride has been frequently implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 hospital infections, the agency's review of numerous reports and studies on quaternary ammonium compounds and other
antimicrobials (Refs. 4 through 10) indicates that specific causes for contamination, such as lack of aseptic technique
when applying intravenous infusions and sterilization failure of the items used (bottles, tubing, distilled water
used in diluting benzalkonium chloride), were the problem and not overuse of benzalkonium chloride. The agency discussed
this problem in the previous tentative final monograph and stated that it appears that practices in the health-care
facility environments where quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly used often fall short of the minimum necessary
to prevent outbreaks of infection. (See comment 51 43 FR 1210 at 1218.) Benzalkonium chloride is more prone to become
contaminated for several reasons that were brought out in the studies: (1) 

Pseudomonas

 species are among the bacteria most resistant to surface-active agents like quaternary ammonium compounds. (2)
The usual quaternary ammonium compound concentration appears to be ineffective against some species, such as 

Pseudomonas cepacia

, an organism which has been reported to have been associated with hospital infections. One study showed that this
organism survived 14 years in a salt solution preserved with 0.05 percent benzalkonium chloride. (3) Organic materials
(gauze, cotton, cork in stoppers, soaps), inorganic matter, protein, and anionic substances inactivate quaternary
ammonium compounds. (4) Hospital personnel are unfamiliar with these problems and with procedures for using quaternary
ammonium compounds safely and effectively. Based on these reports, the agency agrees with the comments that ``improper''
use, not ``overuse,'' is the cause of benzalkonium chloride being implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 contamination and that there is a lack of data demonstrating ``overuse'' to be the cause.

The agency also agrees with the comment which stated that it was an unproven hypothesis that overuse of an antiseptic
causes 

Pseudomonas

 overgrowth. The ``Summary for Basis of Approval'' from an approved NDA for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) cites
a skin flora study that indicated that the axilla was an area where gram-negative micro-organisms continued to be
isolated even though chlorhexidine gluconate has shown gram-negative effectiveness. The comment cited FDA's Division
of Anti-Infective Drug Products' recognition that for health-care uses, such as surgical scrub and health-care
personnel handwash, there would be no problem with 

Pseudomonas

 overgrowth because the hands are an area of the body not likely to support the growth of 

Pseudomonas

 because of the lack of moisture. In defending triclosan, the comment contended that this ingredient is bacteriostatic
and does not eliminate all gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it would not predispose for gram-negative overgrowth.
Triclosan has been implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 contamination because it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria, has limited in vitro and in vivo
activity against gram-negative bacteria, and no activity against 

Pseudomonas

 (43 FR 1210 at 1232). One report showed that triclosan was effective against some gram-negative micro-organisms,
but not effective against 

Serratia

 and 

Pseudomonas

 (Ref. 11). 

Pseudomonas

 and 

Serratia

 resistance caused the contamination, not overuse of the antiseptic. 

The agency agrees with the comments that quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan have been implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 hospital infections more frequently than povidone-iodine, but studies indicate that `overuse' of these or any antimicrobial
has not been the cause. 

Pseudomonas

 species may become dominant because of inherent resistant factors which enable them to survive the effects of many
antibiotics and antiseptics (Refs. 12, 13, and 14). In addition, this genus is ubiquitous, found in both soil and water,
and can multiply in almost any moist environment with even a trace of organic material (Ref. 15). 

The agency believes that the data and reports have not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care
antiseptics, including benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, have brought about overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria,
particularly 

Pseudomonas

. The agency agrees with the comments that improper use, failure of hospital personnel to use according to labeling
indications, nonaseptic technique in diluting and handling, and lack of good quality control to ensure sterility
of items in contact with antiseptics, such as sterile distilled water, hosing, and receptacles, are responsible.


The study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3) shows that repeated in vitro exposure of seven gram-negative micro-organisms,
including 

P. aeruginosa

, in povidone-iodine dilutions did not result in the development of resistance. The agency notes that CDC previously
recommended povidone-iodine for use in intravenous catheter and other procedures (Ref. 2). However, there has been
one report from CDC (Ref. 16) which described 

Pseudomonas

 hospital infections caused by intrinsically contaminated povidone-iodine (contaminated during manufacture,
indicating failure of control of microbiological contamination). Compliance with the agency's regulations governing
current good manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR part 211) should prevent intrinsic contamination.


Accordingly, the agency concludes that a cautionary statement against overuse is not needed in the professional
labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. Therefore, the previously proposed caution in  333.99(a)
is not being included in this tentative final monograph. If new information indicates a need for a cautionary statement,
the agency will consider appropriate action at that time.

E. Comment on Alcohol 



10. One comment submitted data on the safety and 
effectiveness of 62 percent alcohol formulated in an emolliented 
vehicle and dispensed as a foam (Ref. 1) and requested that 
alcohol be included in the topical antimicrobial monograph as a 
surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, and hand 
degermer.

Data on the safety and effectiveness of alcohol formulated 
in an emolliented vehicle for use as a surgical hand scrub, 
health-care personnel handwash, and hand degermer were submitted 
to the Miscellaneous External Panel (Refs. 2 and 3). However, 
the data were not reviewed or categorized for these uses during 
that rulemaking. In reviewing alcohol for short-term uses, that 
Panel stated, ``ethyl alcohol acts relatively quickly to decrease 
the number of micro-organisms on the skin surface. Each minute 
that scrubbed hands and arms were immersed in approximately 77 
percent ethyl alcohol by volume was found to be equivalent to 6.5 
minutes of scrubbing in water; if the skin was scrubbed with the 
alcohol, the rate was further increased'' (47 FR 22324 at 22328). 
The Panel found ethyl alcohol safe and effective for use as a 
topical antimicrobial preparation in concentrations of 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution. The following

indications were proposed: 

(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
scrapes.'' 

(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
splinter or other foreign object.'' 

(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 

Federal Register 

of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 

The submissions (Refs. 1 and 2) included effectiveness data and labeling for a currently marketed product containing
62 percent ethyl alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam used ``* * * to
degerm hands * * *.'' The agency has reviewed these data, derived from effectiveness testing as a surgical
hand scrub (glove juice test) and health-care personnel handwash, and finds that they meet the procedures in the testing
guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242). Statistical analyses showed 
microbial reduction to be highly significant. A glove juice test 
showed that alcohol foam reduced the baseline number of bacteria present in normal skin flora, after first use, by
1.87 logs, and, after continued use for 5 days, by 2.36 logs. The reduction of the baseline number of bacteria was maintained
for up to 6 hours under surgical gloves. A health-care personnel handwash effectiveness test showed microbial reduction
on test subjects' hands, artificially contaminated with 

Serratia marcescens 

(

S. marcescens

). Microbial reduction averaged 3.3 logs after 5 
treatments and 3.63 logs after 25 treatments. In vitro data, 
derived from studies using 

S. marcescens

 as the test bacteria, 
showed that alcohol properly formulated in an emolliented vehicle 
and dispensed as a foam, significantly reduced the number of test 
bacteria, in 10 percent serum, within 15 seconds. 

Based on these data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous 
External Panel (47 FR 22324), the agency concludes that alcohol, 
when properly formulated, is effective for use as a surgical hand 
scrub and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. 
Because it is well established that alcohol alone does not 
provide persistence, the agency notes that a preservative agent 
in the vehicle provided the persistent effect to maintain 
reduction in the baseline number of bacteria for 6 hours as 
required to demonstrate efficacy as a surgical hand scrub drug 
product. 

The agency is including alcohol in proposed  333.410(a) 
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash), 
 333.412(a) (patient preoperative skin preparation), and  333.414(a) (surgical hand scrub), as follows:
``Alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
regulations in 27 CFR part 20.'' Further, the agency finds the Miscellaneous External Panel's proposed Category
I indication for OTC alcohol drug products, i.e., ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' to be an appropriate
indication for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. Based on that 
Panel's recommendations, the agency is including this indication 
as an additional claim for alcohol drug products in 
 333.460(b)(2) of the proposed monograph. In addition, based on 
that Panel's similar recommendations for isopropyl alcohol (47 FR 
22324 at 22329 and 22332), the agency is proposing this 
indication for OTC isopropyl alcohol drug products in 
 333.460(b)(3). As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the 
agency is proposing new effectiveness criteria for drug products 
labeled for this use. 

The monograph will also state that an alcohol drug product 
must be properly formulated, such as the product in an 
emolliented vehicle dispensed as a foam discussed above, to meet 
the test requirements in  333.470. This means that alcohol when 
intended for certain uses must be able to demonstrate 
effectiveness by certain tests proposed in this tentative final 
monograph, as follows: (1) Antiseptic or health-care personnel 
handwash_ 333.470(b)(2), (2) patient preoperative skin 
preparation_ 333.470(b) (3), and (3) surgical hand scrub_ 333.470(b)(1). As discussed in section
I.B., comment 5, the term ``antiseptic handwash'' in lieu of ``hand degermer'' is being proposed in the monograph
as the statement of identity for this type of product.

The labeling for the alcohol product (Ref. 1) provides directions for use without water rinsing, where water is not
readily available, as follows: ``A `palmful' (5 grams) is dispensed in one hand. It is spread on both hands and rubbed
into the skin until dry (approximately 1 to 2 minutes). A smaller amount (2.5 grams) is then dispensed into one hand,
spread over both hands to wrist, and rubbed into the skin until dry (approximately 30 seconds).'' The agency concurs
with these directions and is incorporating them into its proposed directions for use for OTC topical antiseptic drug
products, including alcohol, formulated for use without water in this tentative final 
monograph. See proposed  333.455(c) and  333.465(c).

F. Comments on Chlorhexidine Gluconate 




11. Several comments requested that the agency include chlorhexidine gluconate as a Category I ingredient in any
amended tentative final monograph. The comments submitted references and data to establish general recognition
of safety and effectiveness (Ref. 1), and stated that chlorhexidine gluconate solution is recognized in the ``British
Pharmacopeia'' (Ref. 2) and is 
formulated in a wide range of products that have been successfully marketed to a material extent and for a material
length of time in other countries. The comments asserted that when formulated in compliance with FDA's current good

manufacturing practice regulations (21 CFR part 211), chlorhexidine products are safe and effective for use as skin
wound cleansers, skin wound protectants, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, surgical
hand scrubs, and health-care personnel handwashes. 




A reply comment argued that chlorhexidine gluconate, currently marketed in the United States under approved new
drug applications (NDA's), is not eligible for an OTC drug monograph because the ingredient has not been marketed
within this country to a material extent and for a material length of time. The comment added that variations in final
formulations may alter the 
safety and effectiveness of the ingredient. The comment submitted data (Ref. 3) to support this viewpoint and requested
that chlorhexidine gluconate be classified in Category II. 


In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210), chlorhexidine gluconate (4 percent solution) was neither
addressed nor categorized as Category I, II, or III. However, subsequent to the tentative final monograph, the agency
granted a petition (Ref. 4) and in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1979, reopened the administrative record to allow interested persons an opportunity to submit data and
information (44 FR 13041). The comments (Ref. 1) and reply comment (Ref. 2) were submitted in response to that notice.
However, since that time a majority of the comments on chlorhexidine submitted in response to the notice have been
withdrawn (Ref. 5). While the withdrawn comments remain on public display as part of the administrative record, 
they are no longer being considered in this rulemaking. 


The agency has reviewed the marketing history of chlorhexidine gluconate and finds that although it has been marketed
for professional or hospital use under NDA's, insufficient data remain in the public administrative record for 
this rulemaking to support general recognition of safety and effectiveness for OTC use. Accordingly, chlorhexidine
gluconate 4 percent aqueous solution as a health-care antiseptic is a new drug and is not included in this tentative
final monograph.

G. Comments on Chloroxylenol 




12. A number of comments disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of chloroxylenol in the tentative
final monograph. They argued that a reevaluation of the data previously submitted to the agency along with new data
that have been submitted (Refs. 1 through 16) would provide adequate 
justification for classifying chloroxylenol in Category I for safety and effectiveness for use in antimicrobial
soaps, health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, skin wound
cleansers, skin wound protectants, and surgical hand scrubs. Several comments pointed out that the Antimicrobial
II Panel unanimously concluded that chloroxylenol is generally recognized as safe for topical use in 
athlete's foot and jock-itch preparations. 



Based upon the submitted data (Refs. 1 through 16) and other information reviewed by the Antimicrobial Panels, the
agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that chloroxylenol
(0.24 percent to 3.75 percent) was safe but not effective for short-term use as an OTC topical first aid antiseptic
(54 FR 33644 at 33658). These data (Refs. 1 through 16) and new data submitted under the agency's ``feedback'' procedures
(Refs. 17 through 30) are insufficient to support a Category I classification of the safety and effectiveness of the
ingredient for other long-term uses, e.g., antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical
hand scrub. The agency concludes that chloroxylenol 
remains classified in Category III as an active ingredient for these uses. However, the ingredient would be considered
safe for short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation but remains in Category III due to a lack of effectiveness
data for this use. 


In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1222 and 1238), the agency stated that the data were insufficient
to reclassify chloroxylenol into Category I, and the ingredient remained in Category III for safety and effectiveness.
Indicating concern about the absorption of topically applied 
antimicrobial drug products used repeatedly by consumers over a number of years, the agency stated the following
regarding the safety of the ingredient:





Only the most superficial toxicity data in animals were submitted to and reviewed by the Panel. The Commissioner concurs
with the Panel that toxicity in rodent and nonrodent species, substantivity, blood levels, distribution and metabolism,
as well as any subsequent systemic absorption studies must be characterized * * *. The degree of absorption
of PCMX following topical administration has not been established. The target organ for PCMX toxicity in 
animals also remains unidentified and should be shown in a long-term animal toxicity study.

While safety data (Refs. 1, 2, 6, and 7) are sufficient to establish safety for short-term use such as for a patient preoperative
skin preparation drug product, these data do not resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity. Conclusions
on these data, which were also reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products (Antimicrobial
II Panel) in conjunction with its review of OTC topical antifungal drug products, were published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 23, 1982 (47 FR 12480). That Panel, which evaluated the safety of the ingredient for use in OTC topical antifungal
drug products, categorized chloroxylenol (0.5 to 3.75 percent) as safe (Category I) for short-term use (up to 13 weeks)
and advised, ``* * * relatively low doses of chloroxylenol can be systemically tolerated,
at least over a 13-week period. The Panel is concerned about the effect of chronic administration on the liver, but
does not consider that topical application of chloroxylenol to small areas of the skin over short periods of time would
result in liver damage.'' (47 FR 12480 at 12534). The agency subsequently agreed with the Panel's conclusions concerning
the safety of using the ingredient in OTC topical antifungal drug products for the treatment of athlete's foot, jock
itch, and ringworm (maximum treatment duration 4 weeks) in its tentative final monograph for these OTC drug products,
published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 12, 1989 (54 FR 51136 at 51139). The agency subsequently finalized these conclusions in the final rule
for OTC topical antifungal drug products published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49890). 

Regarding long-term chronic toxicity, data and information provided by one manufacturer included final reports
of completed studies and interim reports of incomplete studies (Ref. 2). The information also contained a protocol
of a planned preclinical study (projected starting and completion dates for experiments) which identified a 2-year
rat feeding study. Because this study might resolve concerns about long-term chronic toxicity, the agency requested
the raw data (Ref. 31); however, the manufacturer declined to submit the data, explaining that it is no longer interested
in marketing chloroxylenol, that its study had not been completed, and that the study was conducted prior to establishment
of the Good Laboratory Practices regulations (Ref. 32). 

In response to the agency's determination that data from a 2-year rat feeding study were essential (Ref. 33), another
manufacturer submitted additional information along with copies of already available safety data (Ref. 34). The
manufacturer explained that it believes that long-term safety data, i.e., 2-year oral feeding study, while not currently
available, may not be a necessity. Citing statements made by the Panel, that its recommended guidelines for the safety
testing of these drug products were developed primarily for antimicrobial agents applied to the entire body surface
and that appropriate tests should be chosen to reflect the intended use of the antimicrobial drug product (39 FR 33103
at 33135), the manufacturer contended that the guidelines were developed to address the most extreme exposure to
an antimicrobial ingredient rather than to describe the minimal requirements for safety data that the Panel would
find acceptable. Noting the contrast between the use of surgical hand scrub drug products (products used by adults
in a limited area of the body for a specified time span) with lifetime application to the entire body in bar soaps, the
manufacturer contended that while the use of a surgical hand scrub is considered chronic use, the exposure to the antimicrobial
ingredient during such use is limited to the hand and half the distance to the elbow. The manufacturer further suggested
that one might simply regard the use of health-care antiseptic ingredients in handwashes and surgical scrubs as repeated
daily use in a limited area of the body. 

The manufacturer contended that data from a 2-year feeding study would not contribute any information on the long-term
safety of chloroxylenol that is not already available from subchronic studies (Ref. 35). In support of its contention,
the manufacturer submitted data from subchronic animal toxicity and human bathing studies (Ref. 18) previously
submitted in response to the tentative final monograph for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products and to the Antimicrobial
II Panel. The data also included computer simulation models (Ref. 36) of plasma levels of chloroxylenol that might
occur after dermal applications of varying concentrations of the ingredient. The simulations, based on urinary
excretion data from human bathing studies, predict a lack of potential for accumulation of the ingredient in humans.
Subsequent submissions from the same manufacturer included a review article on the toxicity of chloroxylenol (Ref.
19), a retrospective analysis of the value of chronic animal toxicology studies of pharmaceutical compounds (Ref.
20), and copies of all available toxicity data for chloroxylenol (Ref. 21). Included in the toxicity data was a kinetic
analysis (Ref. 37) of data from human and animal studies of the ingredient previously submitted to the agency that
also predicts that accumulation in humans is not likely to occur at reasonable exposure levels. Based on the above
data and information, the manufacturer requested that the agency reconsider the necessity of a long-term animal
study. In response to the manufacturer's request, a public meeting was held to discuss the available toxicity data
for chloroxylenol. At that meeting, the agency noted that many of the subchronic studies of the ingredient are of limited
usefulness because they were conducted using a formulated product that contained isopropyl alcohol, turpineols,
and castor oil soap in addition to chloroxylenol. The kinetic model used in the studies was considered inappropriate.
A one-compartment model, as used in the analysis, is not relevant to chloroxylenol due to its lipophilic nature. The
agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 38 and 39).

After considering the manufacturer's comments and evaluating the data available at the time, the agency concluded
that the information was not adequate to characterize the level of absorption, the distribution, the metabolism,
and the excretion of chloroxylenol following topical administration. In a 1988 letter to the manufacturer (Ref.
40), the agency stated: (1) That data from the human bathing studies reviewed are highly variable (absorption 0.5
to 15.7 percent), (2) the analytical methodology used in the studies had not been validated and (3) that the small number
of subjects included in the studies made it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from the reported results. The
agency commented further that submitted accumulation predictions were not adequate to define the toxicity that
might occur with repeated exposure to the ingredient because no data have been submitted to support or validate the
model's assumptions in characterizing exposure and stated that additional data are needed to justify, support,
and verify the assumptions and data used in the predictions. Pointing out that accumulation is not the sole issue of
long-term toxicity, the agency asserted that long-term toxicity may be related to repeated daily exposure to low
levels of the ingredient over a lifetime. 

In that same letter, the agency stated that it had reexamined the necessity for a long-term animal study based on the
manufacturer's assertion that use of the ingredient as an antiseptic handwash and surgical scrub should be regarded
as repeated use to a limited area of the body, and had concluded that data from additional short-term studies conducted
under actual use conditions (i.e., where abrasion is followed by occlusion, with the level of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient being shown under these conditions) could provide adequate information
to determine whether or not a long-term animal study is necessary. Protocols for a pharmacokinetic surgical scrub
study to develop such data were submitted to the agency (Refs. 41 and 42); however, to date the agency has not received
any data from such a study. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Refs. 43 and
44). 

More recently, the agency received additional data pertaining to the safety of chloroxylenol from another manufacturer
(Ref. 30). The data included an assessment of the ingredient's mutagenic potential by a series of in vitro and in vivo
assays (Ames test, unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes, chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster
ovary cells, and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay). The data also included a dose range-finding study for a teratology
study of the ingredient in rats and the subsequent teratology study. 

Two of the four mutagenicity assays included in the submission yielded suspect or equivocal results. The in vitro
administration of 19, 38, 75, and 150 micrograms per milliliter ( u g/mL) doses of chloroxylenol to Chinese hamster
ovary cells produced a statistically significant increase relative to the solvent control in the mean number of chromosome
aberrations per cell at the 75 and 150  u g/mL dose level both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.
Statistically significant increases in the percent of aberrant cells were also seen at the 75  u g/mL dose in the
absence of metabolic activation and at the 75 and 150  u g/mL doses in the presence of metabolic activation. No dose
response was apparent in either the activated or nonactivated systems. The investigator concluded that the results
were equivocal in the nonactivated test system and suspect in the activated test system. 

The results of the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay demonstrated a statistically significant increase in micronucleated
polychromatic erythrocytes in female mice 24 and 72 hours after oral dosing with 250 and 833 milligrams per kilogram
(mg/kg) doses of chloroxylenol. However, no dose response was apparent. The investigator considered the results
to be a statistical anomaly based on unusually low mean micronucleus values in the negative control group and the lack
of a dose response. However, the agency believes that because the observed increases were significantly elevated
over those of the negative controls (p




 0.01) and were reproducible at two dose levels, these results should be considered equivocal. The manufacturer has
provided additional information (Ref. 45) in response to the agency's interpretation of the results of the mouse
micronucleus assay. However, the agency continues to believe that reliance on data from historical controls is inappropriate
and has not changed its position on the data. The agency's detailed comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 46 and 47). 

In light of the new data (Ref. 30) and the issues that they raise, the agency has again reexamined the data requirements
necessary to support the safe chronic use of this ingredient. The agency finds it necessary to broaden the additional
testing requirements in order to clearly assess potential risks associated with chronic use of chloroxylenol. Therefore,
data obtained from the following are necessary: (1) Human studies conducted under maximal use conditions, i.e.,
repeated use as a surgical scrub use where abrasion is followed by occlusion, characterizing the level of absorption,
the distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the ingredient, (2) a lifetime dermal carcinogenicity study (up
to 2 years) in mice, and (3) an appropriate human epidemiological study performed to determine the effects on health-care
professionals in countries, such as England, where the ingredient has been used extensively for a long period of time
are necessary. Further, in order to relate the data derived from the chronic animal study to humans, the lifetime dermal
carcinogenicity study should also include concomitant absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies.
A protocol for an 18-month dermal carcinogenicity study has been submitted to the agency (Ref. 48). The agency's detailed
comments and evaluation of the data and protocol are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 47).

Regarding the effectiveness of chloroxylenol, the agency stated the following in the previous tentative final monograph:
``Claims for broad spectrum activity have been made * * *; however, the Commissioner finds that inadequate
effectiveness data were submitted. Many studies were old and not performed with modern antiseptic testing procedures.
* * * effectiveness testing both in vitro and in vivo should be done in accordance with the Guidelines''
(43 FR 1238). 

The applicable effectiveness data submitted by the comments were derived from in vivo and in vitro studies (Refs.
1 through 7 and 13 through 16), along with data subsequently submitted under the ``feedback'' procedures (Refs. 22
through 28 and 50). 

Data from in vivo glove juice studies (Refs. 1, 2, 19, and 50) demonstrated the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol
in a range of 3 to 3.75 percent when formulated in an aqueous surfactant vehicle. Chloroxylenol formulations are substantive
in their activity, i.e., they do not produce an initial high reduction in the number of bacteria but after repeated
use (routine use), they reduce the baseline number of bacteria and suppress bacterial growth for 6 hours. In vivo data
for surgical hand scrub products containing chloroxylenol at concentrations lower than 3 percent are insufficient.
Aqueous solutions of chloroxylenol in a pine oil vehicle (1:40 dilution of Dettol

 

) consistently reduced more than 99 percent 

Staphylococcus aureus

 (

S. aureus

) from the hands of test subjects (Ref. 25). 


In vivo cup scrubbing and other appropriate data (Refs. 22, 23, and 24) indicate that chloroxylenol, in 70 percent
alcohol, is fast acting as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, alcohol itself meets the criteria for
a preoperative skin preparation and is a significant contributor for fast acting contaminant reduction. The data
are not sufficient to demonstrate that chloroxylenol in this formulation contributes to the total antimicrobial
effect. 

In vitro study data (Refs. 1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, and 26) show that chloroxylenol in various vehicles is effective against
gram-negative bacteria, i.e., 

Escherichia coli

 (

E. coli

), 

P. aeruginosa

, 

Proteus vulgaris

, and 

Klebsiella aerogenes

 (

K. aerogenes

). This anti-gram-negative activity is formulation dependent. Tested aqueous solutions of pure chloroxylenol
with no other additives show that low concentrations (0.3 mg/mL) reduced 95 percent of some 

Pseudomonas

 in 10 minutes. 

Data regarding the antiseptic activity of chloroxylenol itself are not adequate. While the data are considered sufficient
to support in vitro effectiveness for the finished products, the available data are inadequate to show the contribution
of the chloroxylenol. Because these finished products contain several additional ingredients, e.g., surfactants,
isopropanol, pine oil, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which contributed substantial germicidal
activity, conclusions regarding chloroxylenol's active contribution to the product's efficacy cannot be supported.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluations of the submitted data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch
(Refs. 51 and 52). One manufacturer has responded to FDA's concern and provided additional data (Ref. 53). These data
are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products. In summary,
the data are sufficient to support the in vitro and in vivo effectiveness of the formulations tested. However, additional
data are needed to demonstrate that chloroxylenol contributes to the activity of these formulations. In addition,
data from glove juice studies indicate that the antimicrobial activity of chloroxylenol is substantive in nature
and does not produce an initial high reduction of bacteria, but that repeated use of the ingredient will produce a reduction
in bacteria as well as a suppression of the baseline number of bacteria of the normal skin flora for 6 hours. As discussed
in section I.N., comment 28, the agency is proposing that all antimicrobial products indicated for use as a surgical
scrub or health-care personnel handwash be able to demonstrate an immediate reduction in bacteria and is inviting
comment on the use of substantive antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. 

The agency, therefore, is proposing that chloroxylenol at the concentrations evaluated (0.24 percent to 3.75 percent)
be classified as Category I for safety and Category III for effectiveness for short-term use as a patient preoperative
skin preparation and in Category III for safety and effectiveness for long-term uses, i.e., antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub. The existing data are not adequate to extrapolate and
assess the chronic toxicity of chloroxylenol for long-term use. Before chloroxylenol may be generally recognized
as effective, the agency recommends that appropriate in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data be submitted. The data
should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo tests as described in the testing procedures below.
(See section I.N., comment 28.)

H. Comment on Hexachlorophene 



13. One comment urged reconsideration of hexachlorophene as an OTC ``handwashing agent and antimicrobial skin cleanser
for use in the hospital, doctor's office, and by adult consumers.'' The comment stated that adequate data to support
Category I status were submitted in response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, but were only superficially
discussed by the agency in comment 61 of the tentative final monograph. (See the 

Federal Register

 of January 6, 1978, 43 FR 1210 at 1220.) The comment submitted additional data to support the safety of hexachlorophene,
including a retrospective study on 3 percent hexachlorophene in baby bathing (Ref. 1) and a study of hexachlorophene
blood levels in infants receiving routine antiseptic skin care (Ref. 2). The comment also included a comprehensive
review article on the safety and effectiveness of hexachlorophene (Ref. 3). 

The agency has reevaluated the data discussed in comment 61 in the tentative final monograph (43 FR 1220) and evaluated
the new data, and has determined that the data do not warrant changing the classification of hexachlorophene as a prescription
drug. The infant data (Refs. 1 and 2) were discussed in detail in the tentative final monograph for OTC antimicrobial
diaper rash drug products (55 FR 25246 at 25261 to 25263). 

Summaries of handwash studies were also submitted, but no data were included. In one study, 3 percent hexachlorophene
was tested as a surgical scrub under exaggerated use conditions (Ref. 4). Subjects (number not specified) washed
their hands and forearms in 20 mL hexachlorophene for 10 minutes, 5 times daily, 6 days a week for a total of 58 days. No
signs of toxicity were reported. The blood levels of hexachlorophene reached a plateau 
within 3 days at mean levels of 0.07  u g/mL. 

The agency believes that it would be necessary to test a very large group of subjects (the number of subjects required
to obtain a statistically significant result) with a variety of skin conditions to determine the true degree of absorption.
A similar study reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33103 at 33118) reported blood levels of 0.5  u g/mL or higher. 

In the other study, subjects washed their hands and face three times daily for 3 weeks with either 2 or 5 mL of 3 percent
hexachlorophene (Ref. 4). Blood concentrations reached a plateau within 7 days at mean levels of 0.21  u g/mL for
the 2-mL group and 0.22  u g/mL for the 5-mL group.

Other additional data contained only a brief summary of the historical use of hexachlorophene and primarily cited
publications in the medical literature (Ref. 5). The references provided no new information. Consequently, the
agency has determined that hexachlorophene will continue on prescription status subject to the existing regulation
in 21 CFR 250.250. 

In order for hexachlorophene to be switched to OTC status, the concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel that
hexachlorophene does not have an adequate margin of safety for OTC use (39 FR 33103 at 33117) should be addressed. After
reviewing the submitted data, the agency concludes that the 
safety of this ingredient for OTC use on infants has not been demonstrated. For OTC status for use by adults, any further
submission of data should specifically address the safe OTC use of hexachlorophene in adults. 

Based upon the discussion above, the agency is proposing that hexachlorophene remain available by prescription
only, except when used as a preservative at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less. 

The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 6).

I. Comments on Iodine and Iodophors 



14. One comment pointed out that poloxamer-iodine complex appeared to be incorrectly included in the Category II
list under ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1227), while it is properly listed in Category III for
use as a ``health-care personnel handwash'' (43 FR 1210 at 1229). The comment stated that deletion from the Category
II list would correct the error. 

The agency concurs with the comment that poloxamer-iodine complex for use as a health-care personnel handwash was
incorrectly listed as Category II (43 FR 1227) and that the listing as Category III (43 FR 1229) was correct. 

15. One comment submitted data on the safety and effectiveness of a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting of iodine complexed
by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Ref. 1). The comment stated that this information
had been previously submitted in May 1974, but that the 
ingredient had not been mentioned in the Panel's report or in the agency's proposed monograph and requested that the
agency include it in the monograph. The comment pointed out that the iodophor, formulated as a liquid hand scrub, is
intended for use by surgeons, food handlers, and others for whom reduced bacterial skin flora is of public health significance.


Regarding the comment's statement that the data were previously submitted, the agency has no record of any submission
of these data in 1974. Because this hand scrub was not previously reviewed or categorized as an OTC topical antimicrobial
drug product, the agency reviewed the product's marketing history and considers it appropriate to include this product
in the OTC drug review. The agency has evaluated the data submitted by the comment (Ref. 1) and determined that iodine
complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate is safe for use as a surgical hand scrub
and health-care personnel handwash, but that there are insufficient 
data available to determine its effectiveness for these uses. Therefore, the ingredient is being classified in Category
III.

The data included several studies on the absorption of the iodine complex, blood levels of iodine, and the systemic
toxicity of the iodine complex. Protein-bound iodine (PBI) and iodine blood levels in rabbits were determined following
two studies of acute dermal applications. In the first study, either 2 or 5 mL/kilogram (kg) of the test iodine complex
was applied to the shaved backs of rabbits in one experiment. The method of occlusion, if any, was not stated, but the
test material was washed off after 24 hours. In another experiment, 2 mL/kg of the test iodine complex was compared
with a povidone-iodine complex and both were applied as in the first experiment. PBI and total 
iodine in blood were determined at 0, 24, and 48 hours in both experiments. In all treated animals, the level of PBI was
extremely high at certain times, primarily at 24 hours. Animals receiving the higher dose of iodine complex in the
first experiment seemed to return to normal sooner than those receiving 
the lower dose. All animals returned to normal by 14 days. For purposes of comparison, the second experiment showed
that serum total iodine increased from 1.4 to 30.7 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) in the test iodine complex group
compared to from 1.23 to 37.9 mg/dL in the povidone-iodine group in the 24 hours that the application remained on. In
the second study, 5 mL/kg of the 
test iodine complex was applied to the shaved backs of two groups of five rabbits each. In one group the shaved backs
were occluded for 24 hours and in the other group, the shaved backs were scrubbed for 10 minutes followed by rinsing
and occlusion. An additional group served as an untreated control group. Blood samples for iodine determinations
were taken at 0, 24, and 48 
hours and at 14 days. All five animals in the group in which the iodine complex remained occluded on intact skin for 24
hours had markedly elevated levels of PBI and iodine at both 24 and 48 hours, but were only slightly above normal at 14
days. For the 10-minute scrub animals, the PBI levels were increased in two of five animals at 24 hours, slightly in
all five animals at 48 hours, and were normal at 14 days. 

A study to determine the effect on blood PBI levels of a routine scrubbing procedure in which exposure to the iodine
complex exceeded normal use showed no alteration in PBI levels in four humans who scrubbed twice daily (each scrub
consisting of two 5 minute hand washes with 5 mL) for 26 consecutive days. Also, no irritation was observed. In a similar
study in which the subjects wore gloves for 2 hours after each scrub, PBI levels were not increased, but total iodine
was slightly increased. In two subjects, this increase was greater in the middle of the study, but the total iodine
blood levels were near normal by the end of the study. 

A dermal absorption study in which the shaved backs of four monkeys were rubbed with 0.17 mL/kg of radioactive iodine
complex for 10 minutes, rinsed, wrapped for 2 hours, and the animals sacrificed after 24 hours, revealed that less
than 0.1 percent of the application was recovered in the thyroid, the target organ for iodine. 

A 90-day sub-acute dermal toxicity study was conducted in three groups of monkeys divided into one control group and
two test groups. One test group was scrubbed once for 10 minutes daily with 0.17 mL/kg of the iodine surgical scrub detergent
product and the second group was scrubbed three times with 0.34 mL/kg (once for 10 minutes and twice for 3 minutes each
day). To simulate the wearing of surgical gloves, the treated area of each animal, which consisted of a shaved area
of the back equivalent to about 10 percent of the body area, was wrapped with a rubber dam for 30 to 90 minutes. The study
lasted 13 weeks during which the animals were monitored. Neither test group showed any effects of iodophor treatment
except elevated PBI levels in the 
high dose group, which peaked at one month. Also, there was no significant effect on the thyroid in the treated groups.


The agency believes this iodine complex is safe for humans based on the data from human, rabbit, and monkey studies.
Test data showed very little iodine absorption when the product was used as a scrub, negligible uptake (following
acute dermal application of radioactive iodine complex) by the thyroid in monkeys, and an unchanged thyroid weight
in test groups of 
monkeys following 90 days of sub-acute applications of the iodine 
complex. 

The comment submitted data from one clinical study for evaluating effectiveness as a surgical hand scrub but did not
provide the testing protocol used. Five subjects scrubbed three times daily for 5 days with the iodophor formulation
(containing 1.1 percent iodine). Four subjects completed the study. Surgical gloves were worn for 2 hours after the
first wash of the 
day. Subjects' hands were sampled once each day at the end of the 2-hour gloved period using a single-basin Cade method.
The initial sampling was used to establish a baseline microbial count for each subject. Study results were reported
as the number of organisms per mL of basin water and the percent reduction in the number of organisms recovered. The
reduction in the bacterial 
population ranged from 89 to 98 percent on the first day. By the fifth day, the reduction ranged from 99 to 100 percent.
Similar results were obtained in a comparative study on six subjects using povidone-iodine. 

Although it is clear that the test used was not the glove juice test which is described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242), alternative methods may be acceptable. However, because of the small number
of subjects included in the study, the data are not sufficient to support the Category I classification of this ingredient
for use as a 
surgical hand scrub. Additional studies, of the type described in  333.470(b)(1) of this amended tentative
final monograph, are necessary to support the effectiveness of this surfactant iodine complex for this use.

In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1235), the agency recognized that elemental iodine complexed with
a surfactant type ``carrier'' molecule reduces the amount of immediate ``free'' iodine, because most of the formulated
iodine is bound in the complex. Effectiveness of all iodophors is 
dependent on the release of free iodine as the active agent from the complexing molecule which acts only as a carrier.
The agency acknowledges that iodine complexed with a surfactant is an acceptable way of presenting iodine as an antimicrobial
agent to the skin. However, because most of the formulated iodine may be tied up in the complex and because the information
submitted by 
the comment to support in vitro efficacy (Ref. 2) dealt only with aqueous and/or tincture solutions of free iodine,
testing of the complete formulation is necessary to judge the importance of formulation on the release of the active
ingredient and, thus, its influence on aspects of effectiveness. 

Based on the data submitted, the agency concludes that iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene
sorbitan monolaurate is safe but additional data from appropriate studies are needed to establish general recognition
of effectiveness for use as a surgical hand scrub and health-care 
personnel handwash. The data should include results obtained from both in vitro and in vivo testing procedures. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

16. Several comments objected to the warning proposed for the professional labeling for povidone-iodine and iodophor-surfactant
products: ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors
and the resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions 
(abnormal union of the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' (43 FR 1210 at 1221). The comments
pointed out that the study by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) on which the warning is based is not well controlled,
is rudimentary, and lacks rigorous testing that produces evidence 
which can be statistically analyzed. The comments contended that this article is not sufficient basis for the warning.
The comments requested that the impact of the article by Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson on the labeling of nonsurfactant
iodophors be reevaluated and that povidone-iodine be exempt from the required warning relating to contact of starch
and iodophors. One comment 
stated that there are numerous papers in the literature describing the antiadhesive effect of povidone and povidone-iodine
and submitted nine references dealing with humans and animals that support an antiadhesive effect when povidone
or povidone-iodine is used in intraperitoneal surgery (Ref. 2). 
Another comment explained that starch is well known for producing granuloma and that every package of surgeons' gloves
carries a warning statement to the effect that the outside of the gloves must be cleansed of starch powder prior to use.
The comment concluded that FDA should require a warning label on the gloves, but not on products containing the drug.

FDA has reevaluated the article by Goodrich et al. (Ref. 1), considered the additional cited references (Ref. 2),
and examined current policy on the labeling of United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) Absorbable Dusting Powder (cornstarch).
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson (Ref. 1) provide data from observations and arbitrary scoring of adhesions after intraperitoneal
injection into 4 groups of 13 adult female mice with: (1) Powdered starch 
suspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline, (2) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of an iodophor and washed three times in saline
before resuspension in 1.5 mL normal saline, (3) powdered starch treated with 5 mL of a 10-percent solution of surfactant
washed three times in saline and resuspended in 1.5 mL of normal saline and (4) normal saline (control animals). The
data do not indicate any significant difference between suspensions of the surfactant mixed with starch and the surfactant-iodophor
mixed with starch. The agency's policy on the labeling of surgical gloves treated with Absorbable Dusting Powder
U.S.P., determined upon evidence presented during the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, was published in the


Federal Register

 of May 25, 1971 (36 FR 9475). The agency requires the following statement on surgical gloves treated with Absorbable
Dusting Powder U.S.P.: ``Caution: after donning, remove powder by wiping gloves thoroughly with a sterile wet sponge,
sterile wet towel, or other effective method.'' Products containing Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. for lubricating
surgical gloves were formerly classified 
as new drugs, but are now regarded as transitional devices, for which premarket approval is required under the Medical
Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 FR 63472 at 63474). FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological
Health is establishing categories for all surgical devices, including surgical gloves lubricated with powdered
starch. Any 
changes in the labeling for this class of products will be dealt with in a separate rulemaking procedure and separate


Federal Register

 notice.

The agency believes that the user's removal of dusting 
powder from surgical medical devices (rubber goods) treated with 
Absorbable Dusting Powder U.S.P. decreases the incidence of 
adhesions and is not persuaded that the data in the article by 
Goodrich, Prine, and Wilson provide a sufficient scientific basis 
for a warning label. Therefore, the warning about the 
interaction of iodophors and starch-containing products proposed 
in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph is not 
included in this amended tentative final monograph.

17. A number of comments submitted new data (Ref. 1) to establish that povidone-iodine is safe and effective as a topical
antimicrobial drug. The comments requested that povidone-iodine be reclassified from Category III to Category
I as a topical antimicrobial ingredient for use as an antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel handwash, surgical
hand scrub, patient 
preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant. 

As discussed earlier in this document, this amended tentative final monograph addresses only topical antiseptics
for health-care antiseptic uses as a surgical hand scrub, antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash,
and patient preoperative skin preparation. As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, antimicrobial soaps are no longer
included in this 
rulemaking. The agency addressed the other use categories mentioned in the comment in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644). As discussed in comment 38 of that document (56 FR 33660),
FDA has tentatively concluded that povidone-iodine should be classified in Category I for use as a first aid antiseptic
(formerly 
designated skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). 

The agency has considered the new data submitted and other information in support of the request to reclassify povidone-iodine
from Category III to Category I. On the basis of these data and information, the agency tentatively concludes that
povidone-iodine should be reclassified from Category III to 
Category I as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation,
and health-care personnel or antiseptic handwash drug products.

 The general safety aspects of povidone-iodine that concerned 
the agency in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 
at 1234 to 1236) are addressed elsewhere as follows: (1) The 
effect of povidone-iodine on wound healing. Based upon submitted 
data, the agency concluded in the first aid antiseptic segment of 
this rulemaking that non-surfactant iodophor products 
(povidone-iodine) do not delay wound healing. See comment 42 of 
that document (56 FR 33644 at 33662). Also, the Advisory Review 
Panel on OTC Antimicrobial II Drug Products reviewed 
povidone-iodine's effect on wound healing in its report on 
topical antifungal drug products and concluded that the drug did 
not affect wound healing (47 FR 12480 at 12545). (2) The effect 
of povidone-iodine on thyroid function. In comment 41 of the 
tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug 
products (56 FR 33644 at 33661), the agency discusses studies 
that indicate that topically applied povidone-iodine does not 
cause thyroid dysfunction. (3) The proposed warning about the 
interaction of starch-containing products with iodophors 
resulting in serosal adhesions and other undesirable effects, 
i.e., ``Caution: Do not use this product in the presence of 
starch-containing products. Starch can adsorb iodophors and the 
resulting complex can cause serosal adhesions (abnormal union of 
the serous membranes) and other undesirable effects in the body'' 
(43 FR 1210 at 1221). The agency has reevaluated the proposal and decided that the warning is not supported by the data.
(See 
section I.I., comment 16.) (4) The agency's concern regarding 
molecular weights of povidone-iodine greater than 35,000 daltons 
not being excreted by the kidney and causing lymph node changes. 
In section I.I., comment 18, the agency discusses a previously 
proposed warning regarding this subject and determines, based on 
more recent data, that larger povidone-iodine molecules are not a 
risk when the product is limited to the topical uses included in 
this tentative final monograph. 

The agency's concern about the need for expiration dates 
(not to exceed 2 years after manufacture) because of the lack of 
stability data for several iodophor preparations, which relates 
to the effectiveness of the product, can be satisfied by 
compliance with the current good manufacturing practices 
regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). These regulations 
include, among other things, requirements regarding stability 
testing and expiration dating (see   211.137 and 211.166). 
Therefore, as discussed in comment 40 of the tentative final 
monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 
at 33661), data on the stability of povidone-iodine and the 
proposed 2-year expiration date are no longer considered needed 
in this rulemaking proceeding. 

A second agency concern relating to effectiveness was the 
rate of release of ``free'' iodine from the complex and whether 
there was evidence of germicidal activity over a period of time in clinical application (43 FR 1210 at 1235). As discussed
in 
the tentative final monograph for OTC topical acne drug products 
(comment 5, 50 FR 2172 at 2173), iodine is released from the 
povidone-iodine complex within milliseconds, thus resolving this 
concern. 

With regard to the effectiveness of health-care antiseptic 
uses subject to this rulemaking, the agency has reviewed the data 
and information on povidone-iodine's germicidal in vitro and 
antiseptic in vivo effectiveness (Refs. 1 through 19) and 
concludes that the data are sufficient to reclassify this 
ingredient from Category III to Category I. 

A series of in vitro controlled studies (Ref. 1-C133, 
Volume 1) included a broad spectrum of test micro-organisms which 
were associated with between 40 to 60 percent of the nosocomial 
infections in the urinary tract, surgical wounds, pneumonia, and 
bloodstream, reported by the National Nosocomial Infections 
Surveillance System (NNIS) for the period from January 1985 to 
August 1988 (Ref. 2). In most instances, these test micro-organisms, as proposed in  333.470(a)(1)(ii) (see
section I.C., 
comment 6), were killed after 0.5 to 5 minutes exposure to 
povidone-iodine. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) study 
(Ref. 1-C133) using 30 cultures, both American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC) and recent skin isolates, was also included in 
this series of in vitro studies. The results indicated a range 
for MIC from 87 parts per million (ppm) to 492 ppm for dilutions of povidone-iodine solution and 83 ppm to 476 ppm for
dilutions 
of povidone-iodine surgical scrub depending on the test micro-organism. Tests with controls, neutralizer, and
organic load 
using a serial dilution method were included in the study. 

Gocke, Ponticas, and Pollack (Ref. 3) evaluated the 
susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates from blood, urine, 
sputum, and wound cultures to the bacteriocidal activity of 
povidone-iodine. These clinical isolates contained over half the 
organisms included in  333.470(a)(1)(ii). Results indicated 
that 106 of the 230 organisms tested (46 percent) were killed 
when 1 mL of a standardized suspension containing 108 organisms 
was exposed to a 10 percent povidone-iodine solution for 15 
seconds. Povidone-iodine showed its highest activity against 
gram-negative isolates, with 72 of the 94 isolates (75 percent) 
being killed after a 15-second exposure. Only 34 of the 134 (25 
percent) gram-positive isolates were killed under the same 
conditions. However, further testing of organisms not killed 
after a 15-second exposure indicated that increases in exposure 
time to 120 seconds killed all of the previously ``resistant'' 
isolates. The study design incorporated the use of a neutralizer 
and controls.

The effectiveness of a povidone-iodine formulation on micro-organisms in a clinical setting was demonstrated by
Michael (Ref. 4). The study included 100 subjects with decubitus ulcers following a spinal cord injury. Cultures
of the wounds were taken prior to, during, and upon completion of a once-a-day povidone-iodine treatment. Prior to
treatment, subjects had positive cultures for the following organisms: 

S. aureus 

(60 subjects), 

Klebsiella/Enterobacter

 species (20 subjects), 

E. coli

 (15 subjects), and 

Pseudomonas 

species (15 species). Following an 8-to-10 week period of treatment with povidone-iodine, cultures revealed that
90 of the 110 subjects no longer had positive cultures for these organisms. 
Pereira, Lee, and Wade (Ref. 5) conducted an in vivo gloved hand test that is supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine
as a surgical hand scrub. They examined the effects of surgical scrub duration and type of antiseptic on the reduction
of resident microbial flora. Thirty-four subjects scrubbed with a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation or another
antiseptic formulation using either a 5 minute initial/3 minute consecutive scrub procedure or a 3 minute initial/30
second scrub procedure. Subjects were assigned to one of four groups, and each group was assigned to one of the four
treatments. Sampling was done by the glove juice method using a sampling solution containing a neutralizer. Glove
juice samples were taken from both hands immediately before scrubbing (baseline), from the nondominant hand immediately
after the initial scrub, 2 hours after the initial surgical scrub but before the consecutive scrub (dominant hand),
and 2 hours after one consecutive surgical scrub (dominant hand). No significant difference was found between the
two durations of scrubbing with povidone-iodine. Povidone-iodine produced an immediate 1.2 log

10

 reduction on the dominant hand after an initial 5 minute scrub and a 1.0 log

10

 reduction on the dominant hand immediately after the 3 minute initial scrub. Baseline was not exceeded 2 hours after
either the 5 or 3 minute scrub. 
Aly and Maibach (Ref. 6) evaluated the characteristics of two antimicrobial impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush
drug products. The study, which included a widely used povidone-iodine impregnated surgical hand scrub sponge/brush,
evaluated both the immediate and persistent effect on the resident bacterial flora of the hands plus the effect of
blood on the persistent antimicrobial activity of the surgical hand scrub drug products. In the first phase of the
study, 13 subjects with left and right hand baseline counts of >10

6

 organisms were randomly assigned to perform a total of 11 scrubs with the povidone-iodine impregnated sponge/brush.
Glove juice samples were taken from the right hand of each subject immediately following the first scrub of the day
and from the left hand at either 3 or 6 hours. The entire procedure was repeated on test days 2 and 5. A similar procedure
was used in phase two of the study, except that 2 mL of bacteriologically sterile blood was spread over the hands of 6
subjects following the initial scrub, and sampling occurred only at 3 and 6 hours. Neutralizers were incorporated
into the stripping solution, diluent, and culture media. On day 1, povidone-iodine produced an immediate mean log

10

 reduction of 1.2, and baseline was not exceeded at 3 hours. On days 2 and 5, povidone-iodine produced immediate mean
log

10

 reductions of 2.2 and 2.8, respectively, and bacterial counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours. While counts for
povidone-iodine approached baseline in the presence of blood, counts did not exceed baseline at 6 hours on any day.
Another study (Ref. 1-C104), employing a method similar to the effectiveness testing procedures described
in proposed  333.470(b)(2) of this amended tentative final monograph, demonstrated the effectiveness of
povidone-iodine 5 percent as a health-care personnel handwash. Twenty-five consecutive handwashings were done
in 10 human subjects with a 5 minute rest between washings. Before each washing the hands were dipped in broth culture
containing 2.0 x 10

9

 organisms (

Bacillus subtilis

 var. 

niger

 ATCC 9372) per mL; the contaminant was spread up over the wrists to the forearms. Bacterial counts were done at the completion
of every fifth washing by the glove juice sampling method. Both the dilution fluid and growth media incorporated a
neutralizer. The transient microbial flora of the hands was reduced by an average of 5.8 logs from baseline. 
Dineen (Ref. 7) used a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation as a reference antiseptic in an open crossover evaluation
of a health-care personnel handwash drug product. Participation in the study followed a 1-week prewash period in
which study subjects used only a bland nonantiseptic soap. On day 1 of the study, samples were taken prior to contamination
and again after a second contamination followed by a 15-second wash with a bland nonantiseptic soap, using the glove
juice sampling method. Following the post-wash sampling, subjects washed for 5 minutes with povidone-iodine to
remove any remaining inoculum. The hands of the first three subjects were contaminated with a 1 mL inoculum containing
1 X 10

14

 

S. marcescens, E. coli, P. aeruginosa,

 and 

Providentia stuartii

 (

P. stuartii

). The hands of the seven other subjects were contaminated with a 1 mL inoculum containing 8 X 10

14

 to 2 X 10

15

 

S. marcescens

 and 

P. stuartii

. Inocula concentrations were determined each test day in a parallel experiment. On days 3 or 4 and 5, the procedure
was repeated except that subjects were randomly assigned to wash with either (1) the reference antiseptic or the test
preparation or (2) were crossed over to the preparation not used the previous day. In the interim between test days,
subjects followed the wash and sampling procedure using only the nonantiseptic soap. The number of organisms included
in the 1 mL inoculum was taken as the baseline, and all reductions were calculated on this basis. Neutralizers were
incorporated in both the diluent and the culture medium. When corrected for the average log reduction produced by
the nonantiseptic soap (4-log

10

), the reductions produced by povidone-iodine ranged from 7 to 9 log

10

.

Studies conducted by Ulrich (Ref. 8) and Newsom and Matthews 
(Ref. 9) are supportive of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 
for this indication. Ulrich (Ref. 8) conducted a study using 
povidone-iodine 7.5 percent in 25 subjects. Both hands of each 
subject were contaminated with a stock culture of 

Micrococcus 
roseus

 (2.75  x  10

8

 organisms per hand, the baseline count) and 
allowed to air dry for 60 seconds. This artificial hand 
contamination was followed by a 15-second wash with 5 mL of the 
povidone-iodine preparation, and this same procedure was repeated 
until 25 contaminations/washes had been performed. Glove fluid 
samples were taken after every fifth contamination/wash. 
Dilutions of the glove fluid were made in a sterile diluent that 
included a neutralizer. A neutralizer was also incorporated into 
the culture medium. Based on the average of both hands, the 
povidone-iodine preparation produced a 4.9 and a 5.2 log 
reduction of the transient micro-organisms from baseline by the 
5th and 10th wash, respectively. By the end of the 25th wash the 
povidone-iodine preparation demonstrated a 5.5 log

10

 reduction 
from the baseline bacterial count. 
Newsom and Matthews (Ref. 9) studied test solutions 
containing 5 or 10 percent povidone-iodine on hands artificially 
contaminated with an overnight culture of 

E. coli

. The numbers 
of micro-organisms were measured before and immediately after 
hand disinfection with the test solution in 15 subjects. 
Sampling of the hands was accomplished by kneading the fingertips 
in a ``recovery'' broth that included a neutralizer. A mean 4.4 log reduction from baseline was reported for the bacterial
counts 
taken immediately after the antiseptic wash. 
Ayliffe, Babb, and Quoraishi (Ref. 10) evaluated the effect 
of various detergent and alcoholic antiseptic formulations 
(including a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation) on the 
removal of 

S. aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus 

(

S. 
saprophyticus

), 

P. aeruginosa,

 or 

E. coli

 from contaminated 
fingertips. In one set of experiments, six subjects performed an 
initial wash with an unmedicated soap, followed by the 
inoculation of the tips of the subjects' fingers and thumbs with 
0.02 mL of a broth culture containing either 

S. aureus

 or 

P. 
aeruginosa

. Following contamination, subjects performed either a 
30-second wash with 5 mL of a detergent or alcoholic antiseptic 
preparation, a 30-second wash with an unmedicated soap, or no wash 
at all. Bacterial sampling was accomplished by rubbing the 
fingers and thumbs on glass beads immersed in 100 mL of nutrient 
broth containing neutralizers. All treatments were tested 
against each organism. Results were reported as the log of the 
average number of viable organisms recovered from each subject. 
Against 

S. aureus

, povidone-iodine produced a 3.2 log reduction, 
which was significantly superior to the reduction achieved by the 
unmedicated soap. Against 

P. aeruginosa,

 povidone-iodine 
produced a 2.7 log reduction. However, this was not 
significantly different from the 2.2 log reduction demonstrated 
by the unmedicated soap.

In a second set of experiments (Ref. 10), the same authors assessed the effectiveness of three antiseptic formulations,
including povidone-iodine, and an unmedicated soap in the removal of 

S. aureus, S. saprophyticus

, or 

E. coli

 from contaminated fingertips. Under conditions similar to those in the previous study, povidone-iodine demonstrated
a 3-log reduction in the baseline number of 

S. aureus

, which was significantly superior to the log reduction demonstrated by the unmedicated soap. Povidone-iodine produced
an average 2.1 log reduction in the number of 

S. saprophyticus

 and a 2.8 reduction in the number of 

E. coli

. However, neither of these reductions was significantly different from the reductions produced by the unmedicated
soap. 


Rotter (Ref. 11) evaluated the influence of differences in two testing methodologies on the demonstration of the
effectiveness of povidone-iodine. One test method used is the standard test method (Vienna) for the evaluation of
drug products for hygienic disinfection adopted by the Austrian and German Societies for Hygiene and Microbiology.
In this test model, the release of 

E. coli

 from the finger tips of artificially contaminated hands was determined before and after a 1-minute wash with povidone-iodine.
The second model, based on agency recommendations for the testing of health-care personnel handwashes, evaluated
the release of the 

E. coli

 from all surfaces of artificially contaminated hands by the glove juice sampling method before and after a 1 minute
wash with the ingredient. These comparisons showed no significant difference in the reduction factor produced by
povidone-iodine when tested with the two methods. Povidone-iodine when tested by the Vienna test method produced
a 3.3 log

10

 reduction from the baseline count. When tested by the second method, the ingredient produced a 3.2 log

10

 reduction. 


Rotter (Ref. 11) also used the Vienna test method to assess the effectiveness of rubbing antiseptics onto the hands
versus washing with an antiseptic. Two povidone-iodine containing formulations were included in the assessment.
A watery solution of povidone-iodine with 1 percent available free iodine rubbed onto the skin produced a 4 log

10

 reduction. Washing with a detergent formulation of the ingredient produced a 3.2 log

10

 reduction. However, this reduction was not statistically different from the reduction produced by washing with
a nonantiseptic soap. 


Rotter, Koller, and Wewalka (Ref. 12) used the Vienna test model to assess the effectiveness of a povidone-iodine
liquid soap preparation (containing 0.75 percent available free iodine) for hygienic hand disinfection. The subjects'
hands were contaminated by immersing them up to the mid-metacarpals in a broth culture of 

E. coli

. The hands were allowed to air dry for 3 minutes prior to a pretreatment sampling. Sampling was accomplished by rubbing
the finger tips of each hand for 1 minute on the bottom of a Petri dish containing a phosphate buffer sampling solution
with neutralizers. After a 2-minute wash with the povidone-iodine or liquid soap followed by a 20-second rinse, the
hands were again sampled. Average log values of the counts from the right and left hands of each subject were calculated,
and the difference (log reduction factor) was determined. The povidone-iodine liquid soap formulation produced
a 3.2 log

10

 reduction in the transient organisms. 


Wade and Casewell (Ref. 13) evaluated the residual effectiveness of povidone-iodine against two clinical isolates
associated with hospital outbreaks of infection. An initial determination of the survival of the test organisms
on untreated hands of three subjects was made by contaminating the subjects' finger tips with either of the test organisms
and sampling the individual fingers immediately after contamination and at 1, 3, 10, and 30 minutes. The subjects'
hands were then pretreated by performing three 30-second washes at 5 minute intervals with various alcoholic and
aqueous antiseptic test formulations, including a 7.5 percent povidone-iodine formulation and an unmedicated
bar soap. The contamination and sampling procedure was repeated as before. All formulations were tested against
both organisms. The median value of the log counts for the three subjects as each sampling was plotted against time.
The survival curves for both organisms on hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and on hands with no
pretreatment were similar. Pretreatment with povidone-iodine resulted in counts that were consistently less than
for the untreated hands and for the hands pretreated by washing with an unmedicated soap and water for both organisms.
After 30 minutes, hands pretreated with the povidone-iodine formulation demonstrated a 2.5 log

10

 reduction in the number of viable 

Enterococcus faecium

 and a 3.9 reduction in the number of viable

 Enterobacter cloacae

. 


The agency concludes that these data demonstrate the effectiveness of povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent for use as a
health-care personnel handwash. 


Many 

published

 studies referenced in the submitted data and in the published literature (Refs. 1 and 14 through 19) have evaluated
the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although the procedures
followed are different from those in the previous FDA testing procedures (43 FR 1210 at 1244) and from those proposed
in  333.470 of this amended tentative final monograph, the essential criteria have been met.

Georgiade et al. (Ref. 15) evaluated the effectiveness of two povidone-iodine formulations for use in the preoperative
skin preparation of 150 subjects scheduled for elective surgical procedures. An initial sample for culture was taken
from the unbroken skin of the operation site prior to the use of the formulations, and a baseline bacterial count was
determined. Sampling was by a cup scrubbing method, using a sterile wash solution that incorporated a neutralizer.
The operative site was then gently treated for 5 minutes with a povidone-iodine surgical scrub formulation and allowed
to dry. Following the initial disinfection, a povidone-iodine antiseptic solution was evenly applied to the site
and allowed to dry. The sample site was rinsed with sterile water and a second sample for culture was done. Upon completion
of surgical procedures lasting from 30 to 180 minutes, the sample site was again cultured and sterile dressings were
applied. The reported mean post-scrub reduction in the baseline number of bacteria of the sample site was 30,599 (4.5
log

10

 reduction). This reduction was maintained through the surgery as evidenced by the reported post-operative mean
reduction of 30,613 organisms. 


Vorherr, Vorherr, and Moss (Ref. 16) compared three antiseptic preparations (including 10 percent povidone-iodine),
in 150 female subjects (50 to each preparation) for effectiveness in reducing the numbers of bacteria in the perineum
and groin. The mean log reductions in bacteria after skin preparation with povidone-iodine at 10 minutes and 3 hours,
respectively, were reported as 3.65/3.09 for the perineum and 3.42/2.85 for the groin. Another study by Dzubow et
al. (Ref. 17) evaluated three antiseptic skin preparations frequently used for dermatologic surgical procedures.
A 60-second wipe with 1-percent povidone- iodine was performed in 14 subjects after which aerobic and anaerobic cultures
were taken at 5 and 60 minutes. The aerobic flora were reduced by 2.8 and 2.5 log at 5 and 60 minutes, respectively. The
reduction in anaerobic flora was reported to be 1.7 log at 5 minutes and 1.2 log at 60 minutes. 


Leaper, Lewis, and Speller (Ref. 18) compared the effectiveness of povidone-iodine impregnated drapes, povidone-
iodine with a sterile drape, and conventional preoperative skin preparation with povidone-iodine for the reduction
of skin bacteria. Forty-five subjects scheduled to undergo elective groin surgery were randomized to one of the three
treatments. Impression plates and skin swabs were taken immediately before and after surgery, and swabs were taken
before and after skin incision and closure. Conventional preoperative skin prepping with povidone-iodine produced
the greatest reduction of the bacterial flora (240 colony counts to 34 colony counts, 2.3 log

10

 reduction). 


Duignan and Lowe (Ref. 19) studied the effectiveness of povidone-iodine for reducing pathogenic bacteria in the
vagina. A 1:10 solution of a povidone-iodine formulation containing 0.75 percent available free iodine was instilled
into the vagina of 35 subjects and left in situ for 1 to 3 minutes. Aspirate cultures were taken from the vagina before
and after preoperative disinfection and subcultured into thioglycollate broth containing neutralizers. Povidone-iodine
removed 92 percent of the bacteroides species, anaerobic streptococci, gram negative bacilli, and 

Streptococcus pyogenes

 present prior to the preoperative disinfection.

A surveillance report (Ref. 1-C132) of hospital infections showed that the use of povidone-iodine in preparing
patients for catheterization significantly reduced the rate of urinary tract infections. A 5-year study showed
that the rate of urinary tract infections before October 1977 ranged from 5.2 percent to 11.5 percent (mean 7.8 percent),
but beginning in October 1977 when povidone-iodine was the antiseptic solution in use, the rate ranged from 1.0 percent
to 4.0 percent (mean 2.4 percent). At the 95 percent confidence level this is statistically significant. No method
data accompanied the report except that the urethral meatus was cleansed with cotton dipped in the antiseptic solution
before catheterization. 
The agency believes that these studies and other published and publicly available medical and scientific data demonstrate
that povidone-iodine is effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although all of the trials
were not done the same way, and thus they are not strictly comparable, the weight of the evidence shows that povidone-iodine
is effective both as a preoperative skin preparation and surgical hand scrub, reducing the normal microbial flora
by more than 90 percent and not showing any significant qualitative selection among the normal species found on the
skin. In conclusion, povidone-iodine was effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic and normal skin micro-organisms
and maintained some suppressive effect on skin counts after the initial use. In addition to the data reviewed supporting
the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for these professional uses, the agency classified povidone-iodine
5 to 10 percent as Category I as a first aid antiseptic in the tentative final monograph published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Accordingly, the agency is reclassifying povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent from Category
III to Category I for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products.

18. Several comments objected to the agency's proposal that 
the professional labeling of povidone-iodine products containing 
molecules greater than 35,000 daltons should include warnings 
against parenteral use and against exposure of open surgical 
wounds or deep wounds to the product. (See comment 71, 43 FR 
1210 at 1221.) Some of the comments contended that the Panel 
recommended such warnings because it felt there was widespread 
misuse (unapproved use) of povidone-iodine solution by surgeons 
bathing the peritoneal cavity with povidone-iodine during major 
surgery and then cleansing the area by rinsing. Another comment 
stated that because health-care personnel handwashes or surgical 
hand scrubs require a surfactant, such products so formulated 
would never be considered for peritoneal lavage by surgeons. One 
comment argued that labeling to warn against parenteral use is 
clearly beyond the scope of the OTC drug review and FDA's 
regulatory authority. Another comment stated that it is 
unnecessary to establish an arbitrary molecular weight limit for 
povidone-iodine because no parenteral use of povidone-iodine is 
permitted in any of the approved labeling in the new drug 
applications for those products. 

One comment stated that povidone-iodine is generally 
recognized as safe and effective for use in open wounds and a 
warning against such use would be contrary to clinical experience 
with this drug. In support of this position, the comment 
submitted a controlled study in which the surgical incisions of one group were irrigated before closure with 10 percent

povidone-iodine solution, and the surgical incisions of the 
control group were irrigated before closure with saline solution 
(Ref. 1). The comment stated that the results of this study 
showed a significant decrease in infections when povidone-iodine 
was used, and there were no allergic, adverse, or other 
deleterious effects following this use of povidone-iodine. 

In response to the Commissioner's recommendation for 
research data (43 FR 1210 at 1235), one comment submitted an 
extensive review of the extent of scavenging of residual 
povidone-iodine molecules by the reticuloendothelial system and 
possible lymph node involvement following use in the abdominal 
cavity or in large wounds (Ref. 2). The comment stated that, 
based on these data, povidone-iodine with medium molecular 
weights should not be limited to use on intact skin, nor should a 
warning be required. Another comment stated that the average 
molecular weight of povidone in the povidone-iodine that has been 
used exclusively in topical antimicrobial products for almost a 
quarter of a century is 37,900 daltons, and it presents no risk 
for any of the topical antimicrobial uses covered by the 
tentative final monograph. 

The Panel recognized a relationship between molecular size 
and nodular lymphatic changes accompanying exposure to 
povidone-iodine, but made no decision on limiting the molecular 
size causing such pathology. (See 39 FR 33103 at 33130.) In the 
previous tentative final monograph, FDA evaluated data provided 
in a comment (Ref. 3) that contended there should be restrictions 
on the use of povidone-iodine according to molecular size. 
Published research cited in that comment indicated that povidone 
molecules larger than 40,000 daltons cannot be excreted by the 
kidneys, can cause nodules to appear in the lymphatic system, and 
may induce cosmetic deformities in the area of healing skin 
wounds. Based on expert opinion and the data provided in the 
comment (Ref. 3), the agency proposed that a molecular weight of 
35,000 daltons be established as the safe upper limit for 
povidone-iodine products used parenterally. This calculation 
assumed that a povidone-iodine molecule with this molecular 
weight would be too large to pass through the kidney. (See 
comment 71, 43 FR 1210 at 1221.) FDA also noted its awareness of 
the inappropriate use of povidone-iodine products in open wounds 
and in the abdominal cavity during surgery. (See 43 FR 1235.) 
To promote proper use of povidone-iodine products, FDA proposed 
to recognize two categories of such products. Products with 
povidone-iodine molecular weights less than 35,000 daltons would 
be permitted for general use. Appropriate labeling would place 
each product in its proper category of use. The professional 
labeling of povidone-iodine products containing molecules greater 
than 35,000 daltons would also include warnings against 
parenteral use of, and exposure of open surgical wounds or deep 
wounds to, the product.

In this current tentative final monograph, the agency 
recognizes that the professional uses of povidone-iodine that are 
proposed as safe and effective are limited to a patient 
preoperative skin preparation, health-care personnel handwash, 
and surgical hand scrub. Further examination of the reference 
cited in the previous tentative final monograph (Ref. 3) reveals 
that the reported adverse effects were due to intravenous or 
parenteral use of povidone. Based on the more recent data and 
comments, the agency now believes that neither medium nor larger 
molecular weight povidone-iodine molecules present risks when 
limited to the topical uses included in this tentative final 
monograph. Larger molecules of povidone-iodine would not be 
absorbed if the drug is used for these professional uses in 
accordance with the monograph. Thus, there is no need for the 
professional labeling to limit the molecular weight of 
povidone-iodine products or to require special warnings related 
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. Accordingly, such 
labeling is not being included in this tentative final monograph.

19. Several comments contended that there are numerous 
professional uses for povidone-iodine, particularly uses that 
involve medical devices, that were not discussed by the Panel or 
by the agency in the tentative final monograph. These 
professional uses include catheter care, ostomy hygiene, patient 
skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping, surgical site 
cleansing after stitching, mouth and throat swabbing, treatment 
of the skin before covering a fracture with a cast, antiseptic 
treatment of various scalp problems, and intravenous site 
preparation. One comment added that a pharmacist or other health 
professional may recommend the use of povidone-iodine as a 
douche, perianal wash, or whirlpool concentrate. The comments 
requested that special labeling be added to the monograph to cover all of these uses, but did not submit data regarding
these 
uses. 

One comment also provided professional labeling for 
povidone-iodine used for urinary or intravenous catheter care 
procedures. The suggested labeling included the following terms: 
``antiseptic,'' ``germicide,'' ``microbicidal,'' and ``for hospital and 
professional use.'' 

Several of the professional uses mentioned by the comments 
are not covered by this rulemaking, but they will be addressed 
under other OTC drug rulemakings. For example, the use of 
povidone-iodine for mouth and throat swabbing is included in the 
advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC oral health care 
drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 25, 1982 
(47 FR 22760). The use of povidone-iodine for the treatment of 
scalp problems is addressed in the final rule for OTC dandruff, 
seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products, published in 
the 

Federal Register

 of December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63554). The use 
of povidone-iodine as a douche is addressed in the advance notice 
of proposed rulemaking for OTC vaginal drug products, published 
in the 

Federal Register

 of October 13, 1983 (48 FR 46694). 
The Advisory Review Panel on OTC Hemorrhoidal Drug Products 
stated that the inclusion of antiseptics in OTC anorectal drug 
products ``is useful in concept,'' but ``that proof of any 
significant clinical benefit of claimed antiseptic ingredients 
must be demonstrated in clinical trials'' (45 FR 35576 at 35659). 

That Panel believed that, because of the large numbers of micro-organisms present in feces, there is little likelihood
that 
effective antisepsis could be obtained in the anorectal area with 
antiseptics any more than with soap and water. Because no data 
were submitted on povidone-iodine as a perianal wash, the agency 
did not address this ingredient in the discussion of antiseptics 
in the tentative final monograph for OTC anorectal drug products 
when the agency evaluated the Panel's conclusions. Similarly, 
the ingredient was not included in the final rule for OTC 
anorectal drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of 
August 3, 1990 (55 FR 31766). Parties interested in this use of 
povidone-iodine can submit data and information as part of a 
citizen petition to amend the final rule for OTC anorectal drug 
products. (See 21 CFR 10.30.)

Several of the uses suggested by the comments are related to 
the general category of patient preoperative skin preparation 
that was discussed by the Panel. (See the 

Federal Register

 of 
September 13, 1974, 39 FR 33103 and 33114.) One example is the 
use ``patient skin scrubbing prior to preoperative prepping.'' The 
agency believes that this use can more simply be described by the 
indication ``for preparation of the skin prior to surgery,'' which 
is being proposed in  333.460(b)(1)(i) of this tentative final 
monograph. Other uses are catheter care, ostomy hygiene, and 
intravenous site preparation. Some uses mentioned by the 
comments involve postoperative situations (surgical site cleansing after stitching) or do not even involve a surgical

procedure (treatment of skin prior to covering a fracture with a 
cast or use as a whirlpool concentrate). The agency believes 
that instead of trying to identify in the product's labeling 
every possible situation where use of the product would reduce 
the risk of skin infection, this use of the product can best be 
described by the general indication ``Helps to reduce bacteria 
that potentially can cause skin infection,'' which is being 
proposed in  333.460(b)(1)(ii). 

The agency has considered the term ``for hospital and 
professional use only'' suggested by one comment and finds it 
acceptable for professional labeling. (See section I.D., comment 
8.) Likewise, the agency has no objection to terms such as 
``germicide,'' ``germicidal,'' and ``microbicidal'' being used in 
professional labeling because health professionals understand the 
meaning of these terms. However, the agency does not believe 
there is a need to include in the monograph every one of these 
terms that might be used in the professional labeling of these 
products. These terms will be evaluated by the agency on a 
product-by-product basis, under the provision of section 502 of 
the act (21 U.S.C. 352) relating to labeling that is false or 
misleading. 



J. Comments on Quaternary Ammonium Compounds 



20. One comment requested that benzalkonium chloride be 
placed in Category I as a skin antiseptic, a patient preoperative 
skin preparation, and a skin wound protectant, in addition to its 
present Category I classification as a skin wound cleanser. In 
support of its request, the comment cited several surgery 
textbooks and other references that recommend use of benzalkonium 
chloride at concentrations ranging from 1:750 to 1:5,000 as a 
preoperative skin preparation, surgical scrub, skin antiseptic 
for venipuncture, and in urinary tract procedures, especially in 
catheterized patients (Ref. 1). The comment also submitted two 
studies on a product containing benzalkonium chloride at a 
concentration of 1:1,000: (1) An in vitro study to demonstrate 
that this product formulation acts as a physical chemical barrier 
against contamination by micro-organisms, and (2) a study on 
induced wounds on the arms of 10 healthy subjects to present 
evidence that this product is nonirritating and neither delays 
healing nor favors the growth of micro-organisms (Ref. 2). 

The agency determined in the tentative final monograph for 
OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that the safe and 
effective concentration range for using benzalkonium chloride as 
a first aid antiseptic has been established as 0.1 percent to 
0.13 percent. (See 56 FR 33644 and 33663.) Data submitted to the 
Antimicrobial I Panel and by the comment were sufficient to 
establish safety for products intended for short-term use, such 
as a first aid antiseptic drug product. The data submitted also 
support safety for use as a patient preoperative skin 
preparation, based on the short-term use of the drug for this purpose. However, the data reviewed by the Panel and 
supplemented by the comments to establish the efficacy of 
benzalkonium chloride for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient 
in patient preoperative skin preparations are not sufficient. 
The Antimicrobial I Panel placed this ingredient in Category III 
for this use. (See 39 FR 33103 and 33115.) The agency finds that 
the surgery textbooks and other references cited by the comment 
(Ref. 1) do not contain sufficient information about quantitative 
and qualitative changes in the microbial flora of the treated 
skin areas. Before benzalkonium chloride may be generally 
regarded as effective for use as a patient preoperative skin 
preparation, additional in vitro and in vivo effectiveness data 
are needed. The data should include results obtained from both 
in vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient 
preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See section I.N., 
comment 28.) 

Accordingly, benzalkonium chloride remains classified in 
Category III as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use as a 
patient preoperative skin preparation.

21. Two comments objected to the proposed warning statement 
in  333.92(c)(6) for concentrated products containing quaternary 
ammonium compounds, which states, ``Dilute with distilled water 
before use because acidic or hard water may render the product 
inactive.'' One comment contended that this proposed warning is 
prejudicial to the quaternary ammonium products that can act in 
acidic or hard water and noted that the existence of quaternary 
ammonium compounds that can act as antimicrobials in acidic or 
hard water was recognized in the tentative final monograph 
(43 FR 1210 at 1219). The comment recommended that the labeling 
of products containing quaternary ammonium compounds include a statement, based on appropriate laboratory tests,
about the 
ability of the product to perform in acidic solutions and the 
amount of water hardness (described as parts per million (ppm) 
calcium carbonate) in which the product will continue to be 
effective. 

The other comment stated that several concentrated 
quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 50 percent benzalkonium 
chloride, U.S.P.) registered with the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) conform with the hard-water tolerance requirements 
and therefore can maintain activity at a water-hardness level of 
600 ppm. The comment also stated that pH must be reduced below 
3.5 before the effectiveness of quaternary ammonium compounds is 
decreased to any significant extent (Ref. 1). The comment 
concluded that, because normal potable water supplies do not 
approach these levels for either hardness or acidity, the 
requirement in proposed  333.92(c)(6) for diluting only with 
distilled water is inappropriate and needless. 

In the tentative final monograph, the agency acknowledged 
that hard water and acidity reduce the antimicrobial activity of 
quaternary ammonium compounds, but that there are some newer 
synthesized quaternary ammonium compounds that are not adversely 
affected by hard water and acidity (43 FR 1210 at 1218, 1219, and 
1236). However, these newer quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., 
a mixture of three benzalkonium halide compounds with varying 
chain lengths), while structurally related to benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and methylbenzethonium
chloride 
(the quaternary ammonium compounds which the Antimicrobial I 
Panel reviewed and which the agency proposed as Category III), 
were not reviewed or categorized by the Panel or the agency and 
are not included in this rulemaking. (See comment 58, 43 FR 1210 
at 1219.) Further, the agency notes that the 50 percent 
quaternary ammonium concentrates that conform with EPA standards 
are intended for germicidal uses and not for the antiseptic uses 
that are being considered in this rulemaking. 

The agency is aware that studies have shown that effects of 
acidic water on quaternary ammonium compounds occur only at 
dilutions containing less than the dosage concentration proposed 
in the tentative final monograph (Ref. 2). Higher concentrations 
minimize quaternary ammonium compound inactivation due to pH 
change (Ref. 3). However, it is well known that natural water 
supplies in different areas differ in acidity and hardness. As a 
precautionary measure, FDA believes that concentrates of the 
ingredients considered in this rulemaking should be diluted in 
distilled water by consumers and health-care professionals, 
because information about water pH or hardness in any given area 
is not usually known. Diluting the concentrated quaternary 
ammonium compound products addressed in this rulemaking with 
distilled water ensures that inactivating factors are not 
encountered. Therefore, the agency proposes to retain the 
warning statement, ``Dilute with distilled water before use because acidic or hard water may render the product inactive,''

for diluting any Category I quaternary ammonium concentrate. 
However, because all the quaternary ammonium compounds remain in 
Category III at this time, the warning statement is not being 
included in this tentative final monograph.

K. Comment on Sodium Oxychlorosene 


22. One comment requested that sodium oxychlorosene be 
included in the monograph for use as a topical antiseptic for 
treating localized infections, to remove necrotic debris in 
massive infections, as a patient preoperative skin preparation 
and postoperative irrigant, and for the cleansing and disinfection of fistulae, sinus tracts, empyemas, and wounds.

The comment included a number of references that recommended 
usage of sodium oxychlorosene (Ref. 1). The comment stated that 
``* * * the 25 years of marketing experience, the almost total 
absence of complaints, the number of published articles, the 
unusual spectrum of organisms reported on, all attest to the 
safety and efficacy of this product.'' 
The agency has reviewed the data submitted and concludes 
that the available information does not contain any 
well-controlled clinical studies on the effectiveness of sodium 
oxychlorosene. In addition, no meaningful scientific information 
was presented in regard to safety. Clinical use for a period of 
years may provide corroborative evidence but is inadequate to 
support safe use. A good example is hexachlorophene; this drug 
had been used OTC for many years before more thorough safety 
studies in animals showed that the drug was not as safe as had 
been assumed. The agency concludes that the data are 
insufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of 
sodium oxychlorosene for OTC topical antiseptic use and therefore 
places this ingredient in Category III for both safety and 
effectiveness. 
The agency's detailed evaluation of the data and information 
is on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 2).

L. Comments on Triclosan 


23. A number of comments submitted data and information 
from microbiological, mutagenicity, metabolism, cross-sensitization, photo-sensitization, and drug experience
studies 
on triclosan (Ref. 1). The comments stated that the data and 
information show that triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) is safe and 
effective and that triclosan should be placed in Category I for 
use in the categories that were defined in the previous tentative 
final monograph, i.e., skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, skin 
wound protectant, antimicrobial soap, health-care personnel 
handwash, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical 
hand scrub. In addition, one comment submitted information on 
triclosan (0.1 percent) for the treatment of diaper rash and on 
triclosan (0.1 percent) combined with benzocaine for the 
treatment of sunburn (Ref. 2). 
One comment from the manufacturer of triclosan objected to 
the agency's expressed concern, as stated in the tentative final 
monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1231 and 1233), that there is a proliferation of products containing triclosan marketed to
the 
American consumer (Ref. 3). The comment argued that the agency's 
concerns were without factual basis and submitted sales data, 
held confidential under 21 CFR 10.20(j)(2)(i)(

d

), showing that 
overall sales of triclosan in the U.S. have in fact decreased 
from 1973 to 1977 and that sales for use in bar soaps and 
deodorants have also declined from 1973 to 1977. The comment 
pointed out that it has exclusive U.S. patent rights for 
triclosan and that no license has been, or will be, granted under 
these patents. The comment added that to the best of its 
knowledge triclosan is not used in infant clothing, a use 
mentioned in the tentative final monograph at 43 FR 1231. The 
comment stated that if triclosan is placed in Category I for use 
in antimicrobial soaps, it would limit sales of triclosan to OTC 
use in antimicrobial and deodorant soaps, underarm deodorants, 
and registered Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pesticide 
products. In the future, sales might be extended to include 
approved new drug applications. The comment also pointed out 
that the statement at 43 FR 1233 about the EPA's Office of 
Special Pesticide Review preparing a report on the proliferation 
of triclosan-containing products is in error, and that the 
erroneous statement apparently resulted from a miscommunication 
between FDA and EPA staff. The comment concluded that the 
concerns about proliferation raised by the agency in the 
tentative final monograph should not prevent triclosan from being 
placed in Category I.

Another comment from the manufacturer of triclosan submitted validation reports and raw data from a 2-year chronic
oral toxicity study in rats, and carcinogenicity and reproduction studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, and
monkeys by Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) (Refs. 4, 5, and 6) and asserted that its validation of the studies
shows that triclosan is safe.

Several comments objected to the agency's restriction at 43 FR 1229 that antimicrobial soaps containing triclosan
can only be formulated in a bar soap to be used with water (Ref. 1). The comments argued that such a restriction was not
applied to the other Category III uses of triclosan, 

i.e.

, skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant, and that such a restriction was not recommended
by the Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. The comments suggested that the footnote under ``antimicrobial
soaps'' limiting triclosan to bar soap was probably intended to apply to cloflucarban, which, like triclocarban,
is known for its ``physical and/or chemical incompatibility.''

With regard to safety, the agency evaluated the validation reports to support long-term use of the ingredient (Refs.
4, 5, and 6) and advised the manufacturer of triclosan that the IBT studies were invalid because of numerous problems.
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 7).

The manufacturer subsequently stated its intent to no longer rely on the 2-year chronic oral toxicity IBT study (Ref.
8), and submitted a final report from a new 2-year chronic oral toxicity study in rats (Ref. 9). The agency has determined
that the study data are unacceptable as the sole evidence of the safety of the long-term use of triclosan as a health-care
personnel handwash or surgical handscrub based on the marginal survival of the animals in both the control and treated
groups and uncertainties about the dose and study conduct. Therefore, data from another chronic exposure study are
necessary to assess the safety of the long-term use of triclosan. The agency's detailed comments and evaluation of
the data are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 10). A subsequent submission from the same manufacturer
contained the final report of a two-generation study of the reproductive toxicity of triclosan in rats (Ref. 11).
These data are currently being reviewed by the agency and will be discussed in the final rule for these drug products.
Triclosan remains classified as Category III for safety for long-term use.

The agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33665) that triclosan (in concentrations up to 1.0 percent) is safe for short term use as a first aid antiseptic (formerly
designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The data reviewed (Ref. 1) also support
the safety of triclosan (up to 1.0 percent) for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. However, with regard
to safety for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub, triclosan
remains classified in Category III for safety for long-term use, as stated above.

With regard to effectiveness, in the previous tentative final monograph the agency classified triclosan as Category
II for use as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub because
triclosan has limited activity against gram-negative bacteria. For example, triclosan is the subject of a patent
(patent No. 3,616,256) for use in culture media for isolating 

Pseudomonas

. Because human skin is regarded as a superb ``culture medium,'' the possibility was raised (43 FR 1210 at 1232) that
triclosan might selectively promote overgrowth of 

Pseudomonas

 on the hands of health-care personnel. Based upon data reviewed, the agency advised that in vitro data demonstrate
that triclosan's antibacterial spectrum can be broadened, to be effective against 

Pseudomonas

 when triclosan is properly formulated with anionic surfactants to form a ``synergistic mixture.'' Therefore, FDA
reclassified triclosan (up to 1.0 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) from Category II to Category III
for effectiveness. The agency further advised that additional studies are needed before triclosan can be generally
recognized as effective for specific uses, 

i.e.

, surgical hand scrub, health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and first aid uses
(formerly designated as skin antiseptic, skin wound cleanser, and skin wound protectant). The agency's detailed
comments are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 12).

In response to the agency's comments (Ref. 12), the manufacturer of triclosan requested further guidance, and asserted,
``The overall antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a function of the total formulation
rather than a single ingredient. Although it is impossible to anticipate and test all possible formulations, adequate
in vivo evaluations of triclosan-containing formulations for specific end uses are available to fully justify Category
I status for triclosan as an active ingredient in surgical hand scrubs, health-care personnel handwashes, and antimicrobial
soaps.'' The comment submitted effectiveness data from four in vivo studies on formulations of triclosan (Ref. 13).
These data included three previously unsubmitted studies (RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981), RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981),
and CAB/AVD (February 2, 1982)), and one previously submitted study (66-D15-W221, OTC Volume 020038)
that had been reviewed by the Panel (39 FR 33128). In study 

RDP/19/23 (June 24, 1981)

, following modified glove juice test procedures, a test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol)
and a control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) were compared for reduction of normal baseline flora and persistence
of that reduction for 3 hours on the hands of 15 test subjects. The test product (0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent
n-propyl alcohol) and the control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) immediately reduced approximately 99.5 percent
of the baseline number of bacteria. After 3 hours, 0.5 percent triclosan in 60 percent n-propyl alcohol suppressed
the baseline count better than the vehicle control; for example the test product allowed about a onefold increase
in bacterial count within 3 hours, while the vehicle control (60 percent n-propyl alcohol) allowed an approximately
twelvefold increase. Although the test used was not the glove juice test described in the antimicrobial tentative
final monograph, alternative methods are acceptable, provided criteria meet those of the glove juice test procedures
described in the guidelines. (See ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test),'' 43 FR 1210
at 1242.) The agency has the following comments regarding the protocol for the study: only 15 subjects (an insufficient
number) were tested; a baseline count from 3 samplings was not established before the test; the log

10

 reduction in bacteria from baseline was determined after 3 hours, but not after 6 hours; and the results of the test
were not analyzed statistically.

In study 

RDP/19/21 (February 2, 1981)

, 2 percent triclosan in a liquid soap vehicle reduced baseline counts of test bacteria 

E. coli 

ATCC 11229, 

P. aeruginosa 

ATCC 15442, and Staphylococcus species on the hands of human test subjects by 1 log greater than the water control after
2 minutes of handwashing. In study 

CAB/AVD (February 2, 1982)

, triclosan (unknown concentrations) in a liquid soap formulation, compared to a vehicle control, maintained reduction
of baseline counts (within 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes) after artificial contamination with 

K. aerogenes. 

In study 

66-D15-W221 (in OTC Volume 020038)

, 0.5 percent, 1 percent, and 2 percent triclosan in Ivory

R

 soap was compared to Ivory

R

 soap without triclosan, as a control, to show reduction of baseline counts on the hands of five human test subjects
after 5 days. Using the Quinn Split-Use Modification of the Price-Cade Method, increased skin-degerming activity
was shown after 3 days of repeated (10) applications of triclosan as compared to the control. However, the number of
test subjects (5) is not adequate to demonstrate general recognition of effectiveness. (See the ``Modified Cade
Procedure,'' 43 FR 1210 at 1243.)

The agency concludes that the data (Ref. 13) discussed above indicate that formulations of triclosan significantly
reduce the baseline count of bacterial skin flora. However, before triclosan may be generally recognized as an effective
health-care antiseptic for use in antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative
skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products, additional in vivo data, i.e., glove juice test data, are
needed. The in vivo data should correlate with data obtained from in vitro studies. Because of the nature of the intended
uses of health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency believes it is essential to assure the effectiveness of
the active ingredient, triclosan, in final formulations. To demonstrate effectiveness in vitro, information is
needed on the germicidal activity of the vehicle alone, so that the germicidal contribution of triclosan attributed
to the total effectiveness of the finished formulation can be determined. (See section I.N., comment 28.)

Accordingly, triclosan (up to 1 percent, with the lower limit to be determined) is being classified as Category III
for use in health-care antiseptic drug products as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash
or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub. The agency's conclusions are summarized below:






The agency has communicated further with EPA and has ascertained that there is no specific report on the proliferation
of triclosan (Ref. 14). Regarding exclusive patent rights, the agency advises that these are not among the determining
criteria to establish general recognition of safety and effectiveness, and therefore cannot be used in the evaluation.
However, having reviewed the new data along with the previously submitted data, the agency concludes that there is
no proliferation problem with triclosan.

Finally, the agency did not intend to restrict formulations of triclosan to bar soap. The agency has reviewed the Panel's
recommendations and the footnotes in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1229) and finds that triclosan
under ``antimicrobial soaps'' was erroneously marked with the reference to the footnote ``Category III only when
formulated in a bar soap to be used with water.'' 
The use of triclosan in products for the treatment of diaper rash was discussed in the tentative final monograph for
antimicrobial diaper rash drug products published on June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246 at 25277 to 25278). The use of triclosan
in products for treating sunburn will be addressed in the 

Federal Register

 at a later date in another OTC drug rulemaking for drug products for this use.

M. Comments on Combinations of Active Ingredients 


24. One comment stated that the Panel did not review safety and effectiveness data submitted to it on mercufenol chloride
(orthohydroxyphenylmercuric chloride) 0.1 percent and secondary amyltricresols 0.1 percent as single ingredients
and in combination for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, and skin wound protectant
(Ref. 1). The comment added that the agency did not discuss these ingredients alone or in combination in the previous
tentative final monograph. 
The comment asserted that secondary amyltricresols, mentioned in the previous tentative final monograph under
phenol (43 FR 1210 at 1238), is not equivalent to phenol because of chemical differences and differing antimicrobial
properties, formulation concentrations, and patterns of use. The comment requested the agency to make decisions
on the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient when used alone, or in combination, as a patient preoperative skin
preparation, a skin antiseptic, or a skin wound protectant. 
The agency has previously reviewed data for first aid antiseptic uses of 0.1 percent mercufenol chloride and 0.1 percent
secondary amyltricresols and found the evidence insufficient to support their safety and effectiveness either
as single ingredients or in combination (56 FR 33644 at 33668). Only safety data on animals were submitted by the comment
(Ref. 1); in general, these studies were conducted on a very small number of animals, did not detail methodology, and
did not adequately describe results (physical condition of the animals). The submitted in vitro studies also lack
sufficient detail to establish the effectiveness of mercufenol chloride.

Secondary amyltricresols is a mixture of isomeric secondary amyltricresols, which are derivatives of phenol, and
has pharmacological properties similar to phenol. The agency agrees with the comment that the mixture of secondary
amyltricresols is not equivalent to phenol and should be categorized separately from phenol. The submitted safety
data included a study by Broom (Ref. 2), who reported that amylmetacresol is relatively nontoxic and less toxic than
hexylresorcinol in rats and mice. 
No toxicity studies in humans were included in the information provided by the comment. However, in the tentative
final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products, published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5852 at 5858), the agency proposed that metacresol up to a 3.6-percent concentration be considered
safe when combined with camphor and that a 3-to-1 ratio of camphor to metacresol reduces the irritating properties
of metacresol. Although cresols may cause some irritation when applied to minor wounds, the agency believes that
secondary amyltricresols at the concentration requested (0.1 percent) would not present any safety concerns, particularly
considering the short-term use of antiseptics as patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. The submitted
data are, however, inadequate to establish the efficacy of secondary amyltricresols. 
Data are also needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary
amyltricresols. Only animal safety data are available, and these studies were limited to determinations of the minimum
lethal dose by various routes of administration (Ref. 1). The submitted information on marketing history is not sufficient
to provide general recognition of the safety of these ingredients. The data contained isolated reports of the combination
of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols causing occasional skin irritation, such as burning and blistering
(Ref. 1), adverse effects that need to be more fully studied. 
Most of the effectiveness work on the combination of mercufenol chloride and secondary amyltricresols has been in
vitro. The combination is reported to combine the antibacterial activity of the single ingredients, that is, mercufenol
chloride which is primarily active against gram-negative organisms and secondary amyltricresols which is primarily
active against gram-positive organisms (Ref. 3). One in vivo study on the effectiveness of the combination as a patient
preoperative skin preparation showed a substantial reduction in the skin microflora (Ref. 4). However, because
neutralizers were not used, bacteriocidal activity cannot be differentiated from residual bacteriostatic activity.
In addition, the effect of the 50-percent alcohol in the alcohol-acetone vehicle was not taken into consideration.
Alcohol, 60 to 95 percent, is in Category I for antiseptic health-care uses. 
Under the agency's guidelines for OTC drug combination products (Ref. 5), Category I active ingredients from the
same therapeutic category that have different mechanisms of action may be combined to treat the same symptoms or condition
if the combination meets the OTC combination policy in all respects and the combination is on a benefit-risk basis,
equal to or better than each of the active ingredients used alone at its therapeutic dose. Accordingly, both mercufenol
chloride and secondary amyltricresols and the combination of these ingredients are placed in Category III. The combination
needs further testing of the combined ingredients compared to each individual active ingredient to establish effectiveness
of the combination as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
The agency recommends that in vivo and in vitro effectiveness data be submitted. The data should be based on both in
vitro and in vivo testing procedures as described for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. (See
section I.N., comment 28.)

25. One comment submitted data on a combination drug 
product containing calomel (mercurous chloride) 30 percent, 
oxyquinoline benzoate, and trolamine (triethanolamine) combined 
with fatty acids to form a soap compound, plus a phenol 
derivative that is currently marketed over-the-counter and is 
indicated for use in the prevention of venereal disease (syphilis 
and gonorrhea) (Ref. 1). The comment included a historical 
review and information on in vitro activity of one of the 
ingredients. According to the comment, in 1905 the discovery was 
made that calomel in combination with fats is an effective 
germicide against 

Treponema pallidum

 (

T. pallidum

), the causative 
organism of syphilis. Later, calomel was stated to be active 
against 

Neisseria gonorrhoeae

 (

N. gonorrhoeae

) (the causative 
organism of gonorrhea). 
This combination of ingredients and the indication of 
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea have not been reviewed by 
any OTC advisory review panel. However, because a claim is made 
indicating antimicrobial activity and the product contains 
calomel, which is already included in the rulemaking for OTC 
topical antimicrobial drug products, the agency believes it is 
appropriate to review this combination and labeling claim in this 
amended tentative final monograph. 
The in vitro effectiveness test described in the comment 
(Ref. 1) is a zone of inhibition test comparing the germicidal 
activity of calomel, phenol, and organic silver salts against 


S. aureus 

as an indicator of activity against syphilis (

T. 
pallidum

) and gonorrhea (

N. gonorrhoeae

). According to the 
submission, the causative organisms are not viable in vitro and 
were not used in the testing. The agency points out that it is 
possible to isolate and subculture isolates of 

N. gonorrhoeae

 for 
in vitro antimicrobial testing (Ref. 2), but 

T. pallidum 

cannot 
be grown in vitro (Ref. 3). The agency does not consider the in 
vitro test against 

S. aureus

 to be adequate to support a claim of 
prevention of syphilis and gonorrhea. 
In a separate rulemaking for mercury-containing drug 
products for topical antimicrobial use, calomel was reviewed by 
the Miscellaneous External Panel (47 FR 436 at 440). That Panel 
did note that calomel ``has been used in the past by inunction 
(rubbing into the skin) as a prophylactic against venereal 
disease * * *'' but placed the ingredient in Category II because 
``calomel may be safe as a topical antimicrobial agent, but it is 
not effective for this purpose.'' 
Although it is apparent that calomel 30 percent would be 
considered an active ingredient, it is not clear from the 
available information whether the other ingredients in the 
combination (oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol 
derivative) are also considered active ingredients, nor are the 
concentrations of these other ingredients stated in the submission and no data have been submitted to the OTC drug
review 
on these ingredients in relation to the prevention of venereal 
disease. In the absence of any data, none of these ingredients 
are considered safe and effective for this use. 
The comment did not submit any in vivo data from clinical 
studies to demonstrate that the combination of calomel, 
oxyquinoline benzoate, trolamine, and phenol derivative is safe 
and effective for use in the prevention of syphilis and 
gonorrhea. Preliminary in vitro testing against 

N. gonorrhoeae 


should be conducted before any human clinical trials are done. 
Then, favorable results from two well-controlled clinical studies 
in humans conducted by qualified investigators in two geographic 
locations (at least one should be within the United States of 
America) are needed before any drug product can be recognized to 
be safe and effective in preventing syphilis and gonorrhea. 
Interested individuals should consult with the agency before 
initiating any testing. In conclusion, the agency is proposing 
that this combination of ingredients indicated for the prevention 
of syphilis and gonorrhea be classified Category II in this 
amended tentative final monograph. 
The agency's detailed comments and evaluation on the data 
are on file in the Dockets Management Branch (Ref. 4).

N. Comments on Testing 


26. Numerous comments addressed the agency's modifications 
in the Panel's proposed testing guidelines (43 FR 1210 at 1239 to 
1240), the agency's statements on final formulation testing (43 
FR 1211, 1224, and 1240), and specific protocols for upgrading an 
antimicrobial ingredient from Category III to Category I (43 FR 
1242 to 1246). Stating that the testing guidelines were unclear 
in some places and pointing out inconsistencies between the 
guidelines and the agency's responses to comments at 43 FR 1211 
and 1223 to 1227, a number of comments requested clarification or 
proposed modifications of a number of items in the guidelines.
Several comments requested specific information or submitted 
protocols for testing Category III ingredients. One comment 
requested that manufacturers be permitted to determine which 
protocol to follow to establish safety or effectiveness of an 
ingredient. A number of comments objected to the agency's 
consideration of the testing guidelines as final, and urged 
revisions in the guidelines for publication in the 

Federal 
Register

.
The agency acknowledges that there were some inconsistencies 
in the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness proposed 
in the previous tentative final rule. The agency does not 
consider the previous testing guidelines as final. The agency is 
clarifying in this amended tentative final monograph that all 
final formulations will be required to meet the specifications in 
the final monograph. As stated in section I.N., comment 28, the 
agency is proposing testing procedures in  333.470 for 
evaluating the active ingredient in pure form as well as in the 
complete formulation. The agency recommends that manufacturers 
use these procedures for testing the final formulations of 
products intended for health-care antiseptic use. Manufacturers 
may propose other appropriate testing procedures subject to 
agency evaluation, as requested. The data from these tests are 
not required to be submitted to FDA by the manufacturer. 
However, the agency intends to use these procedures for any 
necessary compliance testing. 
27. Two comments pointed out an apparent conflict in the 
agency's statements concerning safety factor calculations as follows: At 43 FR 1240, the agency concluded that a
minimum of a 
100-fold safety factor should apply to the exposure dose for 
ingredients labeled for repeated daily use; at 43 FR 1241, the 
agency stated that if the safety factor is extrapolated from an 
animal species to man, considering surface area, the highest 
no-effect dose should be used for the multiplier, and in the 
absence of complete data, a 100-fold safety factor should be 
applied when translating the animal highest no-effect dose to 
man; and at 43 FR 1213 (see comment 19), the agency stated that 
modifications of the safety factor will be allowed for specific 
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations. One 
comment suggested that a safety factor of less than 100-fold be 
acceptable when scientific investigation of good quality shows 
that the test animals used in establishing the no-effect dose are 
similar to humans with respect to metabolism (biotransformation 
and pharmacokinetics) and/or tissue susceptibility. Another 
comment stated that a more reasoned and practical approach would 
be to require calculation of certain safety factors as 
recommended, and indicate in a general guideline that 
risk-benefit ratios based on these factors would determine the 
relative merits of the product. 
The agency does not find any conflict in the various 
statements included in the previous tentative final monograph. 
The safety factor calculations were included merely as a general 
guideline. The agency's response to comment 19 at 43 FR 1213 
indicated that the agency would retain a minimum of a 100-fold safety factor applied to the exposure dose for ingredients
in 
products labeled for repeated daily use. However, the agency 
will consider modifications of the safety factor for specific 
ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations and 
where requests are based on submitted data. While the 100-fold 
safety factor was a general guideline in the previous tentative 
final monograph, the agency does not find a need to include a 
general guideline in this amended tentative final monograph. 
28. Numerous comments requested clarification of the 
criteria required to establish effectiveness for each 
antimicrobial product class. One comment stated that the 
``Testing Guidelines'' section seems to indicate that it may be 
necessary to determine the effect of the vehicle on the active 
ingredient. The comment contended that this provision is 
confusing because the preamble discussion in the tentative final 
monograph indicates that vehicle testing will not be necessary 
``* * * where adequate data are available on the active 
ingredients alone.'' (See 43 FR 1210 at 1224.) Another comment 
stated that the Cade handwashing test can only be conducted if 
the antimicrobial is placed in a vehicle and noted that the 
antimicrobial is never used by consumers in its raw form; 
therefore, efficacy testing on the raw antimicrobial ingredient 
should not be required. A third comment stated that the overall 
antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a 
function of the total formulation rather than a single 
ingredient. Another comment added that if an individual product formulation must be tested, and/or the testing of
a product 
vehicle is considered essential, then such testing requirements 
must be specifically described. Citing the definition of an 
antiseptic in section 201(o) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)), one 
comment asserted that the definition requires that the 
antimicrobial product kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms on the skin. The comment proposed that efficacy
can be 
demonstrated by showing that the preparation produces a 
quantitative reduction in the levels of normal skin flora and/or 
inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro. Two comments pointed 
out that the ``Modified Cade Procedure'' handwashing test (43 FR 
1210 at 1243) specifies a one-log reduction of bacteria, but the 
procedure fails to indicate how many uses or days of use of test 
product should produce the reduction. Other comments requested 
that no upper limit be set for bacterial hand counts, that the 
lower limit of 1.5 x 106 per hand be the only criteria for 
subject selection, and that minimal hand count reduction be 
defined in the test protocols for surgical hand scrub and 
health-care personnel handwash products. Another comment 
suggested that modification of the ``Sampling technique and times'' 
(paragraph 6) of the protocol ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical 
Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test)'' (43 FR 1243) was needed because 
the protocol did not indicate the volume of sampling solution but 
only stated that the volume * * * should be ``kept constant'' for 
all tests. The comment recommended that the agency specify a 
range of 50 to 100 mL of sampling solution in order to provide 
consistent and reproducible results.

The agency has carefully reviewed the comments, existing data, and other information, and is clarifying the effectiveness
criteria for health-care antiseptics in this tentative final monograph. 

In order for an antiseptic ingredient to be generally recognized as effective for use as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and/or surgical hand scrub, it must have
existing data from well designed clinical studies demonstrating effectiveness. The agency believes that it is important
to correlate effectiveness data from clinical studies with effectiveness data from in vitro studies on the activity
of the vehicle and active ingredient individually, so that the germicidal contribution of the antiseptic ingredient
to the total formulation can be fully characterized. As stated in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative
final monograph, at 43 FR 1240, ``* * * there should be demonstration that the formulated product is
better than the vehicle alone. Testing of the complete formulation of Category III ingredients * * *
is necessary to judge the importance of the vehicle in the release of the active ingredient as well as the influence
of formulation on aspects of effectiveness * * *.'' The agency believes that information on the in
vitro activity of the active ingredient alone helps to characterize its antiseptic activity independent of formulation
and helps to further define formulation effects on the antimicrobial ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing
that in vitro studies of the antimicrobial activity of health-care antiseptic drug products covered by  333.470(a)(1)(i)
and (a)(1)(ii) be conducted on the active ingredient, the vehicle, and the final formulation. Manufacturers are
to have such data in their files for products containing ingredients included in the monograph. 

In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is proposing that the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the
antiseptic ingredient, the vehicle, and the formulated product be characterized by the determination of their antimicrobial
spectrum and by minimal inhibitory concentration determinations performed against selected organisms using methodology
established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratories Standards (NCCLS) (Ref. 1). Because the principal
intended use of these health-care antiseptic drug products is the prevention of nosocomial or hospital acquired
infections, the agency concludes that these products should be able to demonstrate in vitro activity against a microbial
spectrum that reflects this use. Since 1970, the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (NNIS) has collected
and analyzed data on nosocomial pathogens reported to the Centers for Disease Control by a number of hospitals who
perform prospective surveillance on nosocomial infections. These data provide an indication of the most frequently
occurring pathogens at four major sites of nosocomial infection_the urinary tract, surgical wounds, lungs (pneumonia),
and bloodstream. The agency believes that health-care personnel handwash, surgical hand scrub, and patient preoperative
skin preparations should be able to demonstrate in vitro effectiveness against these pathogens as well as the normal
resident skin flora. Therefore, the agency is proposing that micro-organisms associated with the most commonly
occurring nosocomial infections and those found most often in nosocomial infections of high risk patients as reported
by the NNIS, for the period from January 1985 through August 1988 (Ref. 2), be included in the list of micro-organisms
to be tested in  333.470(a)(1)(ii). The agency further concludes that this proposed list identifies a broad
spectrum of antimicrobial activity that is also appropriate for home use antiseptic handwash products. 

The agency notes that neither filamentous dermatophytic fungi or viruses are included in the NNIS report. More recent
studies (Refs. 3 and 4) have reported small numbers of nosocomial infections associated with both of these organisms.
However, the new studies do not provide sufficient information to assess the relative importance of these organisms
as a cause of nosocomial infection. Therefore, the agency is not proposing to include filamentous dermatophytic
fungi in the list of micro-organisms to be tested, as proposed in the previous in vitro effectiveness testing guidelines
(43 FR 1210 at 1241) and is continuing to propose that viruses also not be included. The agency recognizes that the list
of organisms to be tested may need updating to assure that it remains reflective of current trends in the microbial
etiology of nosocomial infections. The agency intends to update the list as new information becomes available. Further,
the agency invites the submission of comments and specifically data on the role of other organisms, particularly
viruses and filamentous dermatophytic fungi, in nosocomial infections. 

In addition to the characterization of the in vitro spectrum of activity, the agency believes that information on
how rapidly these antimicrobial drug products achieve their antimicrobial effect is necessary. As a means of indicating
how quickly these products achieve their antimicrobial effect, the agency is proposing in vitro time-kill curves
of the formulated drug product as part of the testing requirements. The agency acknowledges that there is currently
no accepted or standardized method that may be used in conducting this type of study and invites the submission of proposed
methods that may be considered as applicable to this test. In  333.470(a)(1)(iv) of the proposed testing regulations,
the agency provides guidance on the development of such methods. However, any time-kill studies submitted to the
agency are to be conducted on a 10-fold dilution of the formulated product against the ATCC strains identified in  333.470(a)(1)(ii)
of the proposed testing regulations and are to include enumeration at times at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 30 minutes.

With regard to proof of clinical effectiveness, the agency is proposing specific criteria for final formulations
of antiseptic handwashes or health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, and surgical
hand scrubs that are based on the recommendations of the Panel and agency experience in evaluating the effectiveness
of these types of drug products, as follows. 

For antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash products, the agency is proposing the following criteria:
(1) A 2-log

10

 reduction of the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the first wash and (2) a 3-log

10

 reduction in the indicator organism on each hand within 5 minutes after the tenth wash, when tested by a modification
of the standard procedure for the evaluation of health-care personnel handwash formulations published by the American
Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) (Ref. 5). 


For patient preoperative skin preparations, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 2-log

10

 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of an abdominal test site, (2) a 3-log

10

 reduction of the microbial flora per square centimeter of a groin test site within 10 minutes from a matched control
area, and (3) the suppression of bacterial growth below baseline for 6 hours, when tested by a modification of the standard
procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparations published by the ASTM (Ref. 6). The agency
believes that the revised effectiveness criteria more closely reflect the conditions of product use, 

i.e.

, on a number of different body sites, each supporting different numbers of resident skin flora. In addition, although
persistence of effect was not recommended by the Panel as a requirement for these drug products, the agency believes
that persistence of antimicrobial effect would suppress the growth of residual skin flora not removed by preoperative
prepping as well as transient micro-organisms inadvertently added to the operative field during the course of surgery
and reduce the risk of surgical wound infection. Based on the proposed effectiveness criteria for this product class,
the agency is proposing a revised definition of a patient preoperative skin preparation drug product in  333.403(c)(2)
of this amended tentative final monograph as follows: ``A fast-acting broad-spectrum persistent antiseptic-containing
preparation that significantly reduces the number of micro-organisms on intact skin.'' 

As discussed in section I.E., comment 10, the agency is proposing the indication ``for the preparation of the skin
prior to an injection'' for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug products. The agency is further proposing that
products labeled for such use demonstrate effectiveness by testing according to the same procedure used to demonstrate
the effectiveness of patient preoperative skin preparation drug products not labeled for this use. Based on this
intended use of alcohol drug products, the agency is proposing a 1-log

10

 reduction in the microbial flora per square centimeter of a dry skin test site within 30 seconds of product use as the
effectiveness criteria for these products. 

For surgical hand scrub products, the agency is proposing the following criteria: (1) A 1-log

10

 reduction of the microbial flora of each hand from the baseline count within 1 minute, (2) suppression of bacterial
growth on each hand below baseline for 6 hours on the first day, (3) a 2-log

10

 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the second day, and (4) a 3-log

10

 reduction of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by the end of the fifth day, when tested by
a modification of the standard procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub products published by the ASTM
(Ref. 7). 

Based on glove juice test data for surgical hand scrub use of povidone-iodine (section I.I., comment 17), alcohol
(section I.E., comment 10), chloroxylenol (section I.G., comment 12), and triclosan (section I.L., comment 23),
the agency concludes that formulated products containing certain ingredients, 

i.e.

, chloroxylenol and triclosan, are substantive in their action and do not produce a high (1-log

10

) initial reduction, but after repeated use for up to 5 days do reduce the baseline count and suppress the count in the
user's glove. In a separate final rule, the agency stated that any product indicated for use as a surgical scrub should
meet a standard for initial reduction. A one-log reduction was found acceptable as the minimal level of reduction
suitable for a surgical scrub in a handwashing test. (See ``New Drugs Containing Hexachlorophene,'' published in
the 

Federal Register

 of December 20, 1977; 42 FR 63771.)

In that same final rule, the agency acknowledged that 
hexachlorophene containing surgical scrub drug products are 
substantive in their action and do not produce an initial high 
reduction but with repeated use are effective in reducing the 
resident skin flora and suppressing bacterial growth in the 
user's glove for up to 6 hours. Based on a lack of available 
products capable of producing both an initial high reduction in 
the resident skin flora and a prolonged microbial suppression 
marketed at the time of the agency's action on the ingredient in 
1972, the agency agreed with the recommendations of its 
Antimicrobial I Panel and concluded that the ingredient should 
continue to be marketed for use as a surgical scrub and for 
handwashing as part of patient care. The agency stated its 
intention to reconsider its criteria for evaluating such products 
in light of risk-benefit judgments as new products containing 
both attributes become available (42 FR 63771). 

Since that final rule was issued in 1977, data have been 
submitted to the agency demonstrating the effectiveness of 
surgical hand scrub formulations capable of producing an initial 
1-log

10

 reduction and a suppression of microbial growth in the 
wearer's glove for up to 6 hours. (See section I.E., comment 10 
on alcohol and section I.I., comment 17 on povidone-iodine.) The 
agency notes that the persistence of the antimicrobial effect 
demonstrated by an alcohol-containing surgical hand scrub 
formulation was provided by a preservative agent in the vehicle. 
Based on the new data, the agency has concerns about the risk associated with the initial use of substantive surgical
hand 
scrub formulations, and with the use of these formulations after 
extended lapses in their routine use. Therefore, the agency is 
proposing that all surgical hand scrub formulations must 
demonstrate an initial one-log reduction in the bacterial flora. 
The agency invites comment on the use of substantive 
antimicrobials in health-care antiseptic drug products. Based on 
the revised effectiveness criterion for these drug products, the 
agency is proposing a revised definition of a surgical hand scrub 
drug product in  333.403(c)(3) as follows: ``An antiseptic 
containing preparation that significantly reduces the number of 
micro-organisms on intact skin; it is broad spectrum, fast 
acting, and persistent.'' 

The agency believes that the modified ASTM procedures for 
the testing of health-care or antiseptic handwashes, surgical 
hand scrubs, and patient preoperative skin preps being proposed 
for inclusion in the testing requirements provide protocols that 
are appropriate for the final formulation testing of these drug 
products. The proposed protocols describe, in detail, study 
conditions and materials to be used and address the concerns 
raised by the comments. For instance, the proposed protocol for 
the testing of surgical hand scrub products includes a baseline 
criterion for subject selection of equal to, or greater than, 1.5 
 x  10

5

 bacteria per hand and specifies that a 50 to 100 mL volume 
of sampling is to be used. The proposed protocols also specify 
requirements for a number of areas not addressed by the testing guidelines proposed in the previous tentative final
monograph. 
For example, they address statistical aspects of study design and 
data analysis, and the use of neutralizers. A positive control 
is included in the protocols as a means of validating the testing 
procedure, equipment, and facilities. The agency believes that 
the proposed protocols for the testing of these products provide 
a consistent approach to the effectiveness testing of health-care 
personnel handwashes, surgical hand scrubs, and patient 
preoperative skin preparations. The agency is incorporating the 
above criteria and testing requirements in proposed  333.470 of 
this tentative final monograph and invites specific comment on 
them at this time. After reviewing any submitted comments or 
data, the agency may revise the testing requirements and 
procedures prior to establishing a final monograph. The agency 
also recognizes that the test procedures may need to be revised 
periodically to reflect new information and newer techniques that 
are developed and proven adequate.

II. The Agency's Amended Tentative Final Monograph 



A. Summary of Ingredient Categories and 
Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions 



1. Summary of Ingredient Categories



The agency has carefully reviewed the claimed active ingredients submitted to 
this administrative record (Docket No. 75N-0183), which includes 
the following: the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (39 FR 
33103) and previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210) for 
OTC topical antimicrobial drug products, the advance notice of 
proposed rulemaking for OTC topical alcohol drug products (47 FR 
22324), and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC 
topical mercury-containing drug products (47 FR 436). Based upon 
the available information, including clinical and marketing 
history, as well as the recommendations of the Miscellaneous 
External Panel, the agency is proposing a tentative 
classification for OTC health-care antiseptic active ingredients. 

Many of the ingredients included in the tabulation below are 
in Category II and Category III because of no data or a lack of 
data on use as a health-care antiseptic. However, all the 
ingredients have been included as a convenience to the reader. 
The agency specifically invites comment and additional data on 
these ingredients. 

The advance notice of proposed rulemaking for alcohol drug 
products for topical antimicrobial OTC human use (47 FR 22324, 
May 21, 1982) is being incorporated into this amended tentative 
final monograph. In that proposed monograph, the Miscellaneous 
External Panel recommended that alcohol 60 to 95 percent by 
volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms regulations at 27 CFR part 21 and 
isopropyl alcohol 50 to 91.3 percent by volume in an aqueous 
solution be classified as Category I for topical antimicrobial 
use. The following indications were proposed: 

(1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and 
scrapes.'' 

(2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a 
splinter or other foreign object.'' 

(3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' 
(See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol 
drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the 

Federal 
Register 

of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.) 

Based upon submitted data and the conclusions of the 
Miscellaneous External Panel, the agency is including alcohol as 
a Category I surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin 
preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
handwash (see section I.E., comment 10). While no comments 
submitted data on health-care uses of isopropyl alcohol, the 
agency notes that one comment (Ref. 1) from a manufacturer 
requested that the OTC alcohol drug products monograph provide 
the labeling indication, ``antibacterial handwash.'' The same 
manufacturer provided a submission (Ref. 2) to the Miscellaneous 
External Panel on a combination product containing isopropyl 
alcohol 50 percent and oxyquinoline sulfate 0.125 percent for use 
as a germicidal-fungicidal wash. However, the Panel disbanded 
before it was able to review the submission, which contained 
labeling for a currently marketed product and in vitro studies of 
the product's bacteriocidal activity. No in vivo effectiveness 
data were submitted for the use of isopropyl alcohol as an 
antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient 
preoperative skin preparation, or surgical hand scrub. 


Based on the lack of data for the use of isopropyl alcohol 
as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
surgical hand scrub, the agency is placing the ingredient in 
Category III for these uses. The agency invites data on these 
uses of isopropyl alcohol. As discussed in section I.E., comment 
10, the agency is including the Panel's recommended indication 
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' as an 
additional Category I indication for patient preoperative skin 
preparations containing alcohol. Based on the Panel's 
recommendations, the agency is also proposing isopropyl alcohol 
as a Category I patient preoperative skin preparation for this 
indication. However, based on the lack of data on the use of 
isopropyl alcohol for more general patient preoperative skin 
preparation use, the agency is not proposing isopropyl alcohol as 
Category I for the other patient preoperative skin preparation 
indications included in  333.460(b)(1), 

i.e.,

 ``for the 
preparation of the skin prior to surgery'' and ``helps to reduce 
bacteria that potentially can cause skin infection.''

The agency has evaluated standard textbooks and published 
data on the effectiveness of isopropyl alcohol used topically on 
the area prior to an injection (Refs. 3, 4, and 5). The minimum 
effective concentration of isopropyl alcohol for this use is 70 
percent. Further, the agency is not aware of any information 
concerning the use of isopropyl alcohol below 70 percent for this 
indication. Therefore, the agency is proposing to include 
isopropyl alcohol 70 to 91.3 percent in Category I for use as a 
patient preoperative skin preparation for the limited indication 
``for the preparation of the skin prior to an injection''. 

The Miscellaneous External Panel recommended that drug 
products containing alcohol and isopropyl alcohol bear the 
following warning: ``Flammable, keep away from fire or flame,'' 
(47 FR 22324 at 22330). The agency concurs with the Panel's 
recommended warning and is proposing this warning in 
 333.450(c)(4) of this tentative final monograph. In order to 
ensure the warning's prominence, the agency is further proposing 
that it appear in boldface type and as the first warning 
immediately following the heading ``WARNINGS''. 

The agency is aware of ten reports (Refs. 6 and 7) of first 
and second degree burns occurring in patients undergoing 
electrocautery procedures. The burns were caused by the ignition 
of the isopropyl alcohol in patient preoperative skin 
preparations containing chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-
iodine in 70 percent isopropyl alcohol. The reports indicate 
that these incidents have occurred despite the presence of 
detailed warnings in the products' labeling cautioning that the 
products are flammable until dry and should not be allowed to 
pool on body surfaces or should not be used in conjunction with 
electrocautery procedures until dry (Refs. 8 and 9). Based on 
these reports, the agency tentatively concludes that patient 
preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl alcohol in 
concentrations of 70 percent or more cannot be adequately labeled 
to allow the safe use of these drug products in conjunction with 
electrocautery procedures. Therefore, the agency is proposing 
that patient preoperative skin preparations containing isopropyl 
alcohol in concentrations of 70 percent or more bear the 
following label warning: ``Do not use with electrocautery 
procedures.'' The agency is further proposing that the proposed 
warning immediately follow the flammable warning being proposed 
in  333.450(c)(4). 

The agency is not currently aware of any similar incidence 
occurring with other nonemollient patient preoperative skin 
preparations containing alcohol in similar concentrations. 
Therefore, at this time the agency is not proposing that patient 
preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol identified in 
 333.412(a) bear a warning concerning the use of these products 
in conjunction with electrocautery procedures. However, the agency will consider extending the warning to patient

preoperative skin preparations containing alcohol if new 
information indicates that this is necessary. The agency invites 
specific comment and data on the safety of both alcohol and 
isopropyl alcohol containing patient preoperative skin 
preparations in conjunction with electrocautery procedures.

The Panel also stated that benzyl alcohol and chlorobutanol 
were safe, but recommended that the ingredients be categorized as 
Category II for effectiveness. However, in the first aid 
antiseptic segment of this rulemaking these alcohol ingredients 
were reclassified from Category II to Category III for 
effectiveness as first aid antiseptic ingredients. (See 56 FR 
33644 at 33673.) Because no comments, data, or information were 
received, and because the agency is not aware of any health-care 
antiseptic uses for these ingredients, benzyl alcohol and 
chlorobutanol are not being classified in this rulemaking for 
health-care antiseptic drug products. 

The agency published an advance notice of proposed 
rulemaking for mercury-containing drug products on January 5, 1982 (47 FR 436). That notice, based upon the recommendations
of 
the Miscellaneous External Panel, proposed to classify OTC 
mercury-containing drug products for topical antimicrobial use as 
not generally recognized as safe and effective and as being 
misbranded. The agency received no comments. The Panel 
classified the mercurial ingredients, as a group, in Category II; 
some for lack of safety, some for lack of efficacy, and others 
due to a lack of both safety and efficacy. However, in the first 
aid antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph, 
several mercury-containing OTC topical antimicrobials have been 
reclassified from Category II to Category III for effectiveness. 
Mercurial ingredients placed in Category II for safety were not 
reclassified. The ingredients reclassified are calomel, 
merbromin, mercufenol chloride, and phenylmercuric nitrate. This 
change was made in keeping with the revised effectiveness 
criteria for the drug product category ``first aid antiseptic,'' 
which were not available at the time the Miscellaneous External 
Panel evaluated the effectiveness of mercurial ingredients. (See 
56 FR 33644 at 33672.) The agency is unaware of any clinical 
data or marketing history for the use of mercury-containing drug 
products as health-care antiseptics. Consequently, these drugs 
have not been classified as health-care antiseptics. In 
addition, the agency has reviewed submitted data on two 
combinations containing mercurial ingredients and proposes a 
Category II classification for these combinations. (See section 
I.M., comments 24 and 25.)

In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that cloflucarban and triclocarban are not generally
recognized as safe and effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care
personnel handwash. The Panel reviewed safety and effectiveness data on these ingredients formulated as a bar soap
and classified them in Category III as a health-care personnel handwash when formulated as a bar soap (39 FR 33103 at
33124 and 33126). No safety and effectiveness data for the use of clofucarban in the other health-care antiseptic
drug product classes were submitted to the OTC drug review; no data were reviewed by the Panel; and no data were received
by the agency. Cloflucarban is therefore considered to be outside this monograph except as a health-care personnel
handwash (formulated as a bar soap). Accordingly, cloflucarban remains Category II as a health-care antiseptic
for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation and surgical scrub and Category III as an antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash. 

Additional safety data and information were submitted to the agency on triclocarban formulated as a soap. As discussed
in the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33664), the agency has reviewed a chronic
toxicity study and other information and determined that triclocarban can be recognized as safe for OTC daily topical
use in a concentration of 1.5 percent. However, no effectiveness data were submitted for any health-care antiseptic
uses of this ingredient and the agency is classifying triclocarban in Category III as an antiseptic handwash or health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. In the previous tentative
final monograph, the agency placed the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban in Category III (43 FR 1210 at
1230) to be ``used in antimicrobial soap * * *''. No additional data were submitted on this combination.
Therefore, the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban remains in Category III for antiseptic handwash or
health-care personnel handwash uses. 

Based upon the Panel's recommendations on phenol, in the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
phenol less than 1.5 percent as Category III and phenol greater than 1.5 percent as Category II for use as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub (43 FR 1227 and 1229). Hexylresorcinol
was also classified in Category III for these uses in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1229). No additional
data were submitted on health-care antiseptic uses of phenol and hexylresorcinol and their classifications are
unchanged in this amended tentative final monograph. In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified
triple dye (a combination of gentian violet, brilliant green, and proflavine hemisulfate) in Category II as a health-care
personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub based on a lack of safety data
(43 FR 1239). No additional data have been submitted and the ingredient remains in Category II for health-care antiseptic
uses. 

In comment 85 of the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1223), the agency deferred classification of several
ingredients to the Miscellaneous External Panel. All of the ingredients have been classified with the exception
of methyl alcohol and gentian violet 1 and 2 percent solutions. The Miscellaneous External Panel at its 38th meeting
placed methyl alcohol in Category II as an OTC topical antimicrobial ingredient for both safety and effectiveness
(Ref. 1). However, this classification was not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol
drug products. The agency agrees with this classification. Further, the agency is not aware of any use of methyl alcohol
in OTC drug products, except as a denaturant. Gentian violet was reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Oral Cavity
Drug Products and placed in Category III based on the lack of effectiveness data for use as a topical antimicrobial
on the mucous membranes of the mouth. The agency is not aware of any data on the use of gentian violet as a health-care
antiseptic and places this ingredient in Category III for this use.

Fluorosalan was not classified as an OTC topical 
antimicrobial ingredient in the previous tentative final 
monograph because the agency stated that final regulatory action 
had been taken against ``* * * the halogenated salicylanilides, 
particularly * * * fluorosalan (21 CFR 310.508) * * *'' (43 FR 
1210 at 1227). Although no comments were received, the agency 
notes that fluorosalan was not addressed in the final rule for 
halogenated salicylanilides (21 CFR 310.508), published in the 


Federal Register

 of October 30, 1975 (40 FR 5027). In reviewing 
the Antimicrobial I Panel's recommendations, the agency has 
determined that the Panel did not intend to include fluorosalan 
in the group of halogenated salicylanilides which it recommended 
be handled more expeditiously by the agency in a separate 

Federal 
Register

 notice. (See the notice of proposed rulemaking for 
certain halogenated salicylanilides as active or inactive 
ingredients in drug and cosmetic products (September 13, 1974, 39 
FR 33102) and the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC 
topical antimicrobial drug products (September 13, 1974, 39 FR 
33103 at 33120).) The agency affirms the recommendation of the 
Antimicrobial I Panel (39 FR 33121) that fluorosalan be 
classified as Category II for use in antiseptic handwash, 
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin 
preparation, and surgical hand scrub drug products. 

The following charts are included as a summary of the 
categorization of health-care antiseptic active ingredients 
proposed by the agency.

2. Testing of Category II and Category III Conditions 

Required testing procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of the complete formulation of a health-care antiseptic
drug product are included in proposed  333.470. These effectiveness testing procedures can also be used to
demonstrate the effectiveness of active ingredients not in a final formulation. Suggested safety testing is described
in the previous tentative final monograph. (See 43 FR 1210 at 1240 to 1242.) 

Interested persons may communicate with the agency about the submission of data and information to demonstrate the
safety or effectiveness of any health-care antiseptic ingredient or condition included in the review by following
the procedures outlined in the agency's policy statement published in the Federal Register

 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47740) and clarified April 1, 1983 (48 FR 14050). That policy statement includes procedures
for the submission and review of proposed protocols, agency meetings with industry or other interested persons,
and agency communications on submitted test data and other information. 



B. Summary of the Agency's Conclusions Including Changes in the Panel's Recommendations and in the Agency's Previous
Recommendations 



FDA has considered the comments and other relevant information and is amending the previous tentative final monograph
with the changes described in FDA's responses to the comments above and with other changes described in the summary
below. A summary of the changes made by the agency in this amended tentative final monograph follows. 

1. All of the section numbers for health-care antiseptics in the previous tentative final monograph have been redesignated
in this amendment. As a convenience to the reader, the following chart is included to show these redesignations.



 


In addition, a number of format changes have been made that are consistent with the format used in recently published
tentative final and final monographs. 



2. The agency is proposing the term ``antiseptic'' as the general statement of identity for the product categories
of patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care personnel handwash drug products.
The agency is also providing manufacturers the option to provide alternative statements of identity describing
only the specific intended use of the product, e.g., surgical hand scrub. When the term ``antiseptic'' is used as the
only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use product, the intended use(s) is to be included as part
of the indications. For multiple use products the agency proposes that a statement of the intended use(s) should also
precede the specific directions for each use. (See section I.B., comment 3.) 

3. The agency is proposing that the statement of identity ``antiseptic handwash'' may also be used for a health-care
personnel handwash. The agency is proposing to expand the indications proposed for health-care personnel handwash
drug products in the previous tentative final monograph to read, ``Handwash to help reduce bacteria that potentially
can cause disease'' or ``For handwashing to decrease bacteria on the skin'' (which may be followed by one or more of
the following: ``after changing diapers,'' ``after assisting ill persons,'' or ``before contact with a person under
medical care or treatment.'') The agency is also proposing ``recommended for repeated use'' as another allowable
indication for this product class. (See section I.B., comment 5.) 

4. The agency has replaced the previously proposed definition of an antimicrobial (active) ingredient with a definition
of an ``antiseptic'' drug that is consistent with the definition of an antiseptic in section 201(o) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)). The agency is also including a definition for a health-care antiseptic
as follows: ``An antiseptic containing drug product applied topically to the skin to help prevent infection or to
help prevent cross contamination.'' The agency has also proposed revised definitions for patient preoperative
skin preparations and surgical hand scrubs that reflect the agency's proposed effectiveness criteria for these
products. (See section I.N., comment 28.) In addition, the agency has made minor revisions in the definitions of a
health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub to reflect the
revised terminology being used in this amended tentative final monograph. 

5. The agency is adding to this amended tentative final monograph a definition of broad spectrum activity as follows:
A properly formulated drug product, containing an ingredient included in the monograph, that possesses in vitro
activity against the micro-organisms listed in  333.470(a)(1)(ii), as demonstrated by in vitro minimum inhibitory
concentration determinations conducted according to methodology established in  333.470(a)(1)(ii). The
agency is proposing to include ``broad spectrum'' in the definitions of the three product classes included in this
tentative final monograph. (See section I.C, comment 6.)

6. The agency has reviewed the 

Other Allowable Statements 

proposed in the previous tentative final monograph in  333.85 for health-care personnel handwash, in  333.87
for patient preoperative skin preparation, and in  333.97 for surgical hand scrub and determined that statements
such as ``contains antibacterial ingredient(s),'' ``contains antimicrobial ingredient(s),'' and ``non-irritating,''
are not related in a significant way to the safe and effective use of these products and are not necessary on products
intended primarily for health-care professionals. Therefore, the agency is not including these statements in this
amended tentative final 
monograph. The statement ``recommended for repeated use,'' proposed for a health-care personnel handwash, has
been included as an ``other allowable indication'' in proposed  333.455. The terms ``broad spectrum'' and
``fast acting'' are included in the definitions of all three product classes and the agency does not see the need to
include this information in the required 
labeling. (See section I.D., comment 7.) 

7. The agency is proposing revised indications for patient preoperative skin preparations in order to more precisely
describe the intended uses of these products. The previous indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``antibacterial,''
and ``antimicrobial'' are not being included. Likewise, the indications ``kills micro-organisms,'' ``bacteriostatic,''
and ``bactericidal'' previously proposed for surgical hand scrubs are not being included in this amended tentative
final monograph. The agency believes that these terms are product attributes and not indications for use and should
not be included as indications in the labeling of these products. 



8. Based on the recommendations of the Miscellaneous External Panel in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking
for OTC alcohol drug products (47 FR 22324 at 22332), the agency is proposing ``for preparation of the skin prior to
an injection'' as an indication for OTC alcohol and isopropyl alcohol drug 
products. 


9. The agency is proposing in  333.450(c) of this amended tentative final monograph the following general warning
statements for all health-care antiseptic drug products: 


(1) ``For external use only.'' 
(2) ``Do not use in the eyes.'' 
(3) ``Discontinue use if irritation and redness develops. If condition persists for more than 72 hours consult a doctor.''
The agency is further proposing that the second sentence of the proposed warning in (3) above may be deleted for products
labeled ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' (See section I.D., comment 8.) In addition to the general warnings
proposed for OTC 
health-care antiseptic drug products, the agency is proposing the following warning for patient preoperative skin
preparations containing isopropyl alcohol identified in  333.412(d): ``Do not use this product with electrocautery
procedures.'' The proposed warning is based on reports of burns associated with the use of isopropyl alcohol containing
patient preoperative skin preparations with electrocautery procedures. (See section II.A., paragraph 1_Summary
of Ingredient Categories.) 


10. Based on its review of the published literature (Refs. 1, 2, and 3), the agency has determined that the way in which
health-care antiseptic drug products are used, 

e.g.,

 method of application, duration of scrub or wash, or use in conjunction with a device (such as a scrub brush), contributes
to the effectiveness of these drug products. Therefore, instead of proposing directions for use of these products
that include fixed scrub or wash durations or methods of application, the agency is proposing in   333.455(c),
333.460(d), and 333.465(c) directions for use that reflect the conditions used when the antiseptic product was tested
according to  333.470(b). In addition, based on data indicating that the largest bioburden of the hands lies
in the subungual region (Ref. 4), the agency is proposing that the directions for use of surgical hand scrub drug products
include the following instructions for the trimming and cleansing of the nails: ``Clean under nails with a nail pick.
Nails should be maintained with a 1 millimeter free edge.''

11. The agency is aware that some manufacturers provide 
technical information relating to the antimicrobial activity of 
their health-care antiseptic drug products in the form of 
technical information bulletins. The agency considers such 
bulletins to be labeling under the provisions of the act. 
Section 201(m) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(m)) defines the term 
``labeling'' as ``all labels and other written, printed, or graphic 
matter (1) upon any article or any of the containers or 
wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.'' As labeling, technical information bulletins are subject to the OTC
drug 
review. 
The agency has no objection to the inclusion of technical 
information relating to the antimicrobial activity of these OTC 
drug products in the labeling of products intended for health-
care professionals only. Therefore, in this amended tentative 
final monograph the agency is proposing that manufacturers have 
the option of including data derived from the in vitro and 
clinical effectiveness tests included in  333.470 of the 
proposed monograph as additional labeling for products labeled 
and marketed ``For Hospital and Professional Use Only.'' In order 
that such additional information provide a standardized 
comparison of the effectiveness of these OTC drug products, the 
agency is further proposing that only data on the antimicrobial 
activity of these OTC drug products derived from the 
effectiveness tests included in  333.470 of this proposed 
monograph be included in the labeling of these OTC drug products. 
At the present time, claims of product effectiveness against 
organisms other than those included in  333.470(a)(1)(ii) will 
require an NDA containing information supporting the deviation 
from the monograph in accord with  330.11. 
12. Based on the wound healing data from studies of test 
wounds in laboratory animals that were discussed in the first aid 
antiseptic segment of this amended tentative final monograph 
(comment 37, 56 FR 33644 at 33662), the agency has reevaluated the labeling for iodine tincture as a patient preoperative
skin 
preparation and is not including the warning ``Do not apply this 
product with a tight bandage, as a burn may result.'' 
13. The agency has determined that data and reports have 
not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care 
antiseptics has brought about overgrowth of gram-negative 
bacteria, particularly 

Pseudomonas.

 Therefore, the previously 
proposed caution in  333.99(a) concerning this overgrowth is not 
being included in this amended tentative final monograph. (See 
section I.D, comment 9.) The warnings proposed in  333.99 (b) 
and (c) of the previous tentative final monograph are not being 
included in this amendment because these warnings apply to 
quaternary ammonium compounds which currently are not Category I 
for health-care antiseptic uses. (See section I.J., comment 20.) 
14. The agency is not including the warning proposed by 
the Miscellaneous External Panel in  333.98(c)(2) for products 
containing isopropyl alcohol, ``Use only in a well-ventilated 
area; fumes may be toxic.'' As discussed in section II.B., 
paragraph 32 of the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid 
antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33556), the agency invites comment on 
the need for such a warning, including any reports of adverse 
reactions due to inhalation that have not yet been brought to the 
agency's attention. 
15. In an effort to simplify OTC drug labeling, the agency 
proposed in a number of tentative final monographs to substitute the word ``doctor'' for ``physician'' in OTC drug
monographs on the 
basis that the word ``doctor'' is more commonly used and better 
understood by consumers. Based on comments to these proposals, 
the agency has determined that final monographs and any 
applicable OTC drug regulations will give manufacturers the 
option of using the word ``physician'' or the word ``doctor.'' This 
amended tentative final monograph proposes that option in 
 333.450(e). 
16. Based on the withdrawal of the majority of the 
comments on chlorhexidine gluconate as a health-care antiseptic, 
sufficient data upon which to make a safety and effectiveness 
determination are no longer present in the rulemaking. (See 
section I.F., comment 11.) 
17. The agency has reviewed the data submitted on 
chloroxylenol and is classifying chloroxylenol 0.24 percent to 
3.75 percent as Category I for safety and Category III for 
effectiveness for short-term use (patient preoperative skin 
preparation) and Category III for both safety and effectiveness 
for long-term uses (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel 
handwash and surgical hand scrub). (See section I.G., comment 
12.) 
18. In  333.30(a) of the previous tentative final 
monograph, the agency included United States Pharmacopeia 
(U.S.P.) specifications for iodine tincture and topical solution. 
In this amended tentative final monograph, the agency is 
identifying these Category I patient preoperative products as 
iodine tincture U.S.P. and iodine topical solution U.S.P.

19. The agency has reviewed the submitted data on 
hexachlorophene and concludes that the data do not address the 
safety concerns expressed by the Antimicrobial I Panel on this 
ingredient. Therefore, the agency is proposing that 
hexachlorophene remain available by prescription only. (See 
section I.H., comment 13.) 
20. The agency has evaluated a ``mixed iodophor'' consisting 
of iodine complexed by ammonium ether sulfate and polyoxyethylene 
sorbitan monolaurate and found it to be safe for use as a 
surgical hand scrub and health-care personnel handwash, but there 
are insufficient data available to determine its effectiveness 
for these uses. Therefore, it is being classified in Category 
III. (See section I.I., comment 15.) The other iodine-surfactant complexes classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel

remain in Category III for health-care uses due to a lack of 
data. 
21. The agency is including povidone-iodine 5 to 10 
percent as a Category I health-care antiseptic ingredient for use 
as a surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, 
and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. (See 
section I.I., comment 17.) As discussed in section I.I., comment 
16, the agency is not including the warning about the interaction 
of iodophors and starch-containing compounds proposed in comment 66 of the previous tentative final monograph (43
FR 1221). The 
agency is also not including professional labeling to limit the 
molecular weight of povidone-iodine or special warnings related 
to the molecular weight of povidone-iodine. (See section I.I., 
comment 18.) 
22. The agency has evaluated the data submitted on 
benzalkonium chloride and determined that the data are not 
sufficient to establish the efficacy of this ingredient as a 
patient preoperative skin preparation. (See section I.J., 
comment 20.) No data were received on other health-care uses of 
this ingredient or health-care uses of the two other quaternary 
ammonium compounds (benzethonium chloride and methylbenzethonium 
chloride) classified by the Antimicrobial I Panel. Accordingly, 
quaternary ammonium compounds remain in Category III as 
health-care antiseptics. 
23. The agency has reviewed data submitted on sodium 
oxychlorosene, an ingredient not previously classified for OTC 
topical antiseptic use, and is placing this ingredient in 
Category III for both safety and effectiveness. (See section 
I.K., comment 22.) 
24. The agency has reclassified triclosan up to 1 percent 
from Category II to Category III as a health-care antiseptic for 
use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic 
handwash or health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand 
scrub. While submitted data indicate that triclosan_when properly formulated_may be effective, data that meet
the 
criteria described in section I.N., comment 28 are needed to 
establish effectiveness. In addition, based upon submitted 
safety data and other information, the agency has reclassified 
the ingredient from Category III to Category I for safety for 
short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. 
Triclosan remains classified in Category III for long-term use 
(antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and 
surgical hand scrub). (See section I.L., comment 23.) 
25. The agency is proposing a number of Category I health-care antiseptic ingredients in this document. All of the

ingredients included in this proposal as Category I health-care 
antiseptic ingredients are standardized and characterized for 
quality and purity and are included as articles in the current 
United States Pharmacopeia or National Formulary (U.S.P./N.F.) 
(Ref. 1). However, a number of other ingredients being 
considered in this rulemaking, 

e.g.,

 triclosan and triclocarban 
are not listed in the U.S.P./N.F. For an active ingredient to be 
included in an OTC drug final monograph, in addition to 
information demonstrating safety and effectiveness, it is 
necessary to have publicly available sufficient chemical 
information that can be used by all manufacturers to determine 
that the ingredient is appropriate for use in their products. 
The agency believes that it would be appropriate for 
parties interested in upgrading nonmonograph ingredients to monograph status to develop with the United States
Pharmacopeial 
Convention appropriate standards for the quality and purity of 
health-care antiseptic ingredients that are not already included 
in official compendia. However, should interested parties fail 
to provide necessary information so that appropriate standards 
may be established, ingredients otherwise eligible for monograph 
status will not be included in the final monograph.

26. The agency is proposing testing requirements for 
patient preoperative skin preparation, antiseptic handwash or 
health-care personnel handwash, and surgical hand scrub drug 
products in  333.470 of this tentative final monograph. As part 
of the effectiveness criteria for a patient preoperative skin 
preparation, the agency is proposing new testing requirements for 
products labeled with the proposed indication ``for the 
preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See section 
I.N., comment 28.)

27. The agency acknowledges that deodorancy is considered a cosmetic claim. However, some deodorant soap products
also bear antimicrobial claims. The agency stated in comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid
antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644 at 33648) that deodorant soap products making antimicrobial claims are considered
to be drugs and that the testing guidelines for antimicrobial claims would be addressed in this rulemaking. Any deodorant
soap product containing a monograph ingredient may be labeled with antimicrobial claims provided the product meets
the testing requirements for health-care antiseptic drug products or surgical hand scrubs as described under proposed
 333.470. 
The agency stated in the previous tentative final monograph for topical antimicrobial drug products (43 FR 1210 at
1244) that actual claims of deodorancy should correlate the microbial reduction achieved in a modified Cade handwashing
test to an ``adequately designed and executed deodorancy test, such as controlled sniff test.'' Several comments
to that proposal objected to such a correlation of deodorancy and microbial reduction. However, none of the comments
provided satisfactory data to enable the agency to include any test in a monograph as a standard for deodorancy due
to antimicrobial activity. Specific testing for antimicrobial claims for deodorancy has not yet been developed.
The agency intends to review any comments or methods submitted for such a purpose in response to this publication and
invites comments and data on this topic. 
28. The Panel's evaluation of OTC topical antimicrobial drug products did not include an evaluation of the use of these
products by the food industry as hand sanitizers or dips. Historically, hand sanitizers and dips have been marketed
as hand cleansers for use by food handlers in federally inspected meat and poultry processing plants and in food handling
establishments. Regulation of these products has been under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
However, it has come to the agency's attention that many of these products include label claims that the agency considers
drug claims, 

i.e.

, ``antibacterial handwash,'' ``kills germs and bacteria on contact,'' or ``effectively reduces bacterial flora
of the skin''. (See comment 10 of the tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products (56 FR 33644
at 33648).) Examination of the labeling of these products (Ref. 1) has led the agency to conclude that the intended
use of these products, 

i.e.

, the reduction of micro-organisms on human skin for the purpose of the prevention of disease caused by contaminated
food, makes them drugs under the provisions of the act. Section 201(g)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)) defines
a ``drug'' as an article ``intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease
in man * * *.'' 
The safety and effectiveness of active ingredients in these products for drug use needs to be demonstrated. Therefore,
the agency is including evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of topical antimicrobial active ingredients
indicated for use as hand sanitizers or dips in the rulemaking for OTC topical antimicrobial drug products. Accordingly,
the agency invites the submission of data, published or unpublished, and any other information pertinent to the use
of topical antimicrobial ingredients in hand sanitizers or dips. The agency also invites comment on applicable effectiveness
standards for these products. These data and information will facilitate the agency's review and aid in its determination
as to whether these OTC drug products for human use are safe, effective, and not misbranded under their recommended
conditions of use. This evaluation will provide all interested parties an opportunity to present for consideration
the best data and information available to support the stated claims for these products. The agency suggests that
all submissions be in the format described in 21 CFR 330.10(a)(2). 
In order to be eligible for review under the OTC drug review procedures, the ingredient must have been marketed in a
hand sanitizer or dip to a material extent and for a material time (21 U.S.C. 321(p)(2)). The submission of data should
include information that demonstrates that the ingredient(s) has been marketed as a hand sanitizer or dip to a material
extent and for a material time. Products with ingredients under consideration in the OTC drug review may be marketed
(at the same dosage strength and in the same dosage form) under the manufacturer's good faith belief that the product
is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded and in accord with FDA's enforcement policies related
to the OTC drug review. (See FDA's Compliance Policy Guides 7132b.15 and 7132b.16.) Such products are marketed at
the risk that the agency may adopt a position requiring relabeling, recall, or other regulatory action. 
The agency notes that antimicrobial hand sanitizers/dips marketed for use in food handling/processing are typically
labeled for a variety of other antimicrobial uses that may include various animal ``drug'' uses and the disinfection
of inanimate objects. These other uses of hand sanitizer or dips will not be included in the agency's evaluation as
part of this rulemaking.

29. The agency is proposing to remove a portion of  369.21 applicable to OTC health-care antiseptic drug products
when the final monograph eventually becomes effective because a portion of the regulations will be superseded by
the final monograph. The item proposed for removal is the entry for ``ALCOHOL RUBBING COMPOUND'' in  369.21.

III. Analysis of Impacts 


FDA has examined the impacts of this proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. This proposed rule increases the number of ingredients tentatively classified
as generally recognized as safe and effective for use in OTC health-care antiseptic drug products from the previous
proposal and, if finalized as proposed, would reduce the need for further safety and effectiveness testing for a number
of health-care antiseptic drug products. The detailed testing procedures included in the proposed rule should assist
manufacturers of products containing ingredients not included in the proposed monograph, due to a lack of demonstrated
effectiveness, in performing the tests that would demonstrate effectiveness so the ingredients can be included
in the final rule. The testing procedures will also provide manufacturers guidance on testing requirements for regulatory
compliance. Products that contain ingredients for which safety and effectiveness are not established will require
reformulation. The proposed monograph includes ingredients that may be used if reformulation becomes necessary.
All products will need some relabeling. One year will be provided from the date of publication of the final rule for
any necessary relabeling or reformulation. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, no further analysis is required. 
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs
associated with product testing, relabeling, repackaging, or reformulation. Comments regarding the impact of
this rulemaking on OTC health-care antiseptic drug products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.
Because the agency has not previously invited specific comment on the economic impact of the OTC drug review on health-care
antiseptic drug products, a period of 180 days from the date of publication of this proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 will be provided for comments on this subject to be developed and submitted. The agency will evaluate any comments
and supporting data that are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the
final rule.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
Interested persons may, on or before December 14, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch, written comments,
objections, or requests for oral hearing before the Commissioner on the proposed regulation. A request for an oral
hearing must specify points to be covered and time requested. Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination
may be submitted on or before December 14, 1994. Three copies of all comments, objections, and requests are to be submitted,
except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments, objections, and requests are to be identified with the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief.
Comments, objections, and requests may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any scheduled oral hearing will be announced in the 

Federal Register

. 
Interested persons, on or before June 19, 1995, may also submit in writing new data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness
of those conditions not classified in Category I. Written comments on the new data may be submitted on or before August
17, 1995. These dates are consistent with the time periods specified in the agency's final rule revising the procedural
regulations for reviewing and classifying OTC drugs, published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 29, 1981 (46 FR 47730). Three copies of all data and comments on the data are to be submitted, except that
individuals may submit one copy, and all data and comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document. Data and comments should be addressed to the Dockets Management Branch. Received
data and comments may also be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
In establishing a final monograph, the agency will ordinarily consider only data submitted prior to the closing of
the administrative record on August 17, 1995. Data submitted after the closing of the administrative record will
be reviewed by the agency only after a final monograph is published in the 

Federal Register

, unless the Commissioner finds good cause has been shown that warrants earlier consideration. 
Therefore, the agency is proposing to amend 21 CFR part 333 by adding new subpart E, consisting of   333.401
through 333.470, and to amend 21 CFR part 369 by amending  369.21 in order to establish conditions under which
OTC health-care antiseptic drug products are generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. 


List of Subjects 


21 CFR Part 333 


Labeling, Over-the-counter drugs, Incorporation by reference. 


21 CFR Part 369 


Labeling, Medical devices, Over-the-counter drugs.

 

Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, it is proposed that 21 CFR parts 333 and 369 be amended as follows: 


PART 333_TOPICAL ANTIMICROBIAL DRUG PRODUCTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER HUMAN USE 


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 333 is revised to read as follows: 






Authority:

 333.450

Labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. 




(a) 

Statement of identity. 

The labeling of a single-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and identifies the product
as an ``antiseptic'' and/or with the appropriate statement of identity described in   333.455(a), 333.460(a),
or 333.465(a). The labeling of a multiple-use product contains the established name of the drug, if any, and may use
the single statement of identity ``antiseptic'' and/or the appropriate statements of identity described in   333.455(a),
333.460(a), and 333.465(a). When ``antiseptic'' is used as the only statement of identity on a single-use or a multiple-use
product, the intended use(s), such as patient preoperative skin preparation, is to be included under the indications.
For multiple-use products, a statement of the intended use should also precede the specific directions for each use.


(b) 

Indications. 

The labeling of a single use antiseptic drug product contains the labeling identified in   333.455, 333.460,
or 333.465, as appropriate. Multiple-use products contain the labeling from any two or all three of   333.455,
333.460, and 333.465. Indications, warnings, and directions applicable to each intended use of the product may be
combined to eliminate duplicative words or phrases so that the resulting indications, warnings, and directions
are clear and understandable.

Testing of health-care antiseptic drug products.



(a) 

General testing criteria. 

The procedures in this section are designed to characterize the effectiveness of antiseptic drug products formulated
for use as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and
surgical hand scrub. Requests for any modifications of the testing procedures in this section or alternative assay
methods are to be submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(1) 

In vitro testing. 

The following tests must be performed using the antiseptic ingredient, the vehicle, and the finished product for
all drug product classes:

(i) Determine the in vitro antimicrobial spectrum of the active ingredient, the vehicle, and the final formulation
using both standard cultures and recently isolated strains of each species. A series of recently isolated mesophilic
strains, including members of the normal flora and cutaneous pathogens (50 isolates of each species, half of which
must be fresh clinical isolates), are to be selected.

(ii) Determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) using methodology established by the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards and entitled ``Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test for Bacteria
that Grow Aerobically,'' Document M7-A2, 2d ed., 10:8, 1990, which is incorporated by reference in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards,
771 East Lancaster Ave., Villanova, PA 19085, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520
Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700,
Washington, DC. Twenty-five fresh clinical isolates and 25 laboratory strains of the organisms listed in this section
are to be included. All in vitro tests must include the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference strains
(available from American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852) specified in paragraphs
(a)(1)(ii)(A) and (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. The agency requires that these organisms be used in testing unless
data can be presented to the agency that other organisms are equally representative of organisms associated with
nosocomial infection. There must be no claims, either direct or by implication, that a product has any activity against
an organism or that it reduces the number of organisms for which it has not been tested. The following organisms are
to be included (note: special media and environmental conditions may be required):

(A) 

Gram negative organisms: Acinetobacter 

species; 

Bacteroides fragilis

; 

Haemophilus influenza

; 

Enterobacter 

species; 

Escherichia coli 

(ATCC Nos. 11229 and 25922); 

Klebsiella 

species, including 

Klebsiella pneumonia

; 

Pseudomonas aeruginosa 

(ATCC Nos. 15442 and 27853); 

Proteus mirabilis

; and 

Serratia marcescens 

(ATCC No. 14756).

(B) 

Gram positive organisms

: Staphylococci: 

Staphylococcus aureus 

(ATCC Nos. 6538 and 29213); Coagulase-negative Staphylococci: 

Staphylococcus epidermidis 

(ATCC No. 12228), 

Staphylococcus hominis

, 

Staphylococcus haemolyticus

, and 

Staphylococcus saprophyticus

; 

Micrococcus luteus 

(ATCC No. 7468); and Streptococci: 

Streptococcus pyogenes

, 

Enterococcus faecalis 

(ATCC No. 29212), 

Enterococcus faecium

, and 

Streptococcus pneumoniae

.

(C) 

Yeast

: 

Candida 

species and 

Candida albicans

.

(iii) Determine the possible development of resistance to the chemical. Two approaches to determining the emergence
of resistance to a particular antimicrobial are to be used. The first approach involves a determination of the evolution
of a point mutation by the sequential passage of an organism through increasing concentrations of the antimicrobial
included in the culture medium. The second approach is a thorough survey of the published literature to determine
whether resistance has been reported for the antimicrobial ingredient. The survey is to include information on the
microbial contamination of marketed products containing the antimicrobial ingredient in question irrespective
of drug concentration. The survey is to cover all countries in which products containing the active ingredient are
marketed. Any information submitted in a foreign language should include a translation. Alternate approaches to
determining the development of resistance can be submitted as a petition in accord with  10.30 of this chapter.
The petition is to contain sufficient data to show that the alternate approach provides a reliable indication of the
development of resistance to a particular antimicrobial ingredient.

(iv) 

Time-kill studies. 

(A) The assessment of the in vitro spectrum of the antimicrobial provides information on the types of genera and species
that may be considered susceptible under the conditions of the test procedure described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)
of this section. However, information is also required that allows an assessment of how rapidly the antimicrobial
product produces its effect. Such information may be derived from in vitro time-kill curve studies using a selected
battery of organisms and a specified drug concentration.

(B) The satisfactory performance of the test product as 
assessed by the results of the MIC studies, the time-kill 
studies, and the simulated in vivo clinical trials of organisms 
representing the resident microbial flora can then be used to 
assess the effectiveness of the test product for the transient 
microbial flora most commonly encountered in the clinical 
setting. This procedure is required because methods, other than 
the health-care personnel hand test, do not exist for assessing 
the in vivo effectiveness of test products versus the transient 
microbial flora. 
(C) It is recognized that a generally accepted or 
standardized method that may be used in conducting in vitro time-kill studies is not available, but the agency encourages
the 
submission of proposed methods that may be considered applicable 
to this test. Many variables that should be considered in the 
development of a method have been addressed for antibiotics and 
are also applicable to these products. Such variables are 
described by Schoenknecht, F. D., L. D. Sabath, and C. 
Thornsberry, ``Susceptibility Tests: Special Tests,'' in the 
``Manual of Clinical Microbiology,'' 4th ed., edited by E. H. 
Lennette et al., American Society for Microbiology, Washington, 
pp. 1,000-1,008, which is incorporated by reference in accordance 
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available 
from the American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC, or 
may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 
7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, 
Washington, DC. 
(D) The procedure to be used is to incorporate the 
recommendations described on page 1,004 of the chapter in the 
``Manual of Clinical Microbiology'' cited in paragraph 
(a)(1)(iv)(C) of this section with the following modifications. 
Because the time frames of greatest interest for antiseptic drug 
products intended for health-care personnel handwash, surgical 
hand scrub, and patient preoperative skin preparation use are 1 
to 30 minutes, the time-kill studies are to focus on these time 
frames and are to include enumerations at times 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 
15, 20, and 30 minutes. Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling 
solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that 
described in ``Standard Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy 
Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, 
Inc., 1015 15th St. NW., Washington, DC 20005), but using 
soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the 
antimicrobial where necessary. The suitability of the 
inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as 
described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of 
Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and 
Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 
11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 
U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The 
American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or may be examined
at the Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-810), 5600 Fishers Lane, 
Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 
800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. The 
battery of organisms selected is to represent the resident 
microbial flora most commonly encountered under actual use 
conditions of the test product and the transient microbial flora 
most likely to be encountered by health-care professionals in 
clinical settings. Therefore, the micro-organisms to be used in 
these time-kill studies are to be the standard ATCC strains 
identified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The drug 
concentration to be tested should be a tenfold dilution of the 
finished product. 
(2) 

In vivo testing.

 The following tests, approximating 
use conditions for the clinical evaluation of each label claim of 
the finished product, are to be carried out using the finished 
product for the product classes specified. 
(i) Test method for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub 
drug products. The procedure to be used (paragraph (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section) is a modification of the standard testing 
procedure for the evaluation of surgical hand scrub drug products 
published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 
``Standard Method for Evaluation of Surgical Hand Scrub 
Formulation, Designation E 1115,'' in ``The Annual Book of ASTM 
Standards,'' vol. 11.04, American Society for Testing and 
Materials, Philadelphia, pp. 201-204, 1986, which is incorporated 
by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 
51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing 
and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or 
may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 
7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, 
Washington, DC. 
(ii) Test method for the evaluation of health-care 
antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug 
products. The procedure to be used (paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section) is a modification of the standard testing procedure 
for the evaluation of health-care antiseptic handwash drug 
products published by the American Society for Testing and 
Materials, ``Standard Method for the Evaluation of Health Care 
Handwash Formulation, Designation E1174,'' in ``The Annual Book of 
ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, American Society for Testing and 
Materials, Philadelphia, pp. 209-212, 1987, which is incorporated 
by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 
51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing 
and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or 
may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 
7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of 
the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, 
Washington, DC. 
(iii) Test method for the evaluation of patient 
preoperative skin preparation drug products. The procedure to be 
used (paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section) is a modification of 
the standard testing procedure for the evaluation of patient 
preoperative skin preparations published by the American Society 
for Testing and Materials, ``Standard Test Method for the Evaluation of a Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation,

Designation 1173,'' in ``The Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 
11.04, American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 
pp. 205-208, 1987, which is incorporated by reference in 
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are 
available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 
1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or may be examined 
at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish 
Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

 reduction of the 
microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use by 
the end of the second day of enumeration, and a 3-log

10

 reduction 
of the microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product 
use by the end of the fifth day when compared to the established 
baseline.

Bacteriological pipets. 

Pipets of 10.0 and 2.2 or 1.1 
milliliter capacity are recommended. 

(

3

) 

Water-dilution bottles. 

Any sterilizable glass 
container having a 150 to 200 milliliter capacity and tight 
closures may be used. 

(

) 

Gloves. 

Sterile loose fitting gloves of latex, 
unlined, not possessing antimicrobial properties. 

(

6

) 

Test formulation. 

Directions used to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the test formulation are to be the same as those 
proposed for the use of the product including the use of a nail 
cleaner and/or brush, if indicated. If no directions are 
available, use directions provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(J)(

3

) 
of this section. 

(

gram Triton X-100 in 1 liter distilled water. Adjust to pH 7.8 
with 0.1 Normal hydrochloric acid or 0.1 Normal sodium hydroxide. 
Dispense 50 to 100 milliliter volumes into water dilution 
bottles, or other suitable containers, and sterilize for 20 
minutes at 121 
 C. Include in the sampling solution used to 
collect bacterial samples from the hand following the final wash 
with the test formulation an antimicrobial inactivator specific 
for the test formulation being evaluated. 

(

ii

) A definitive recommendation regarding the inclusion 
of an inactivator prior to the final wash cannot be made. The 
questions of whether residual neutralizer on the skin will reduce 
the effectiveness of the test formulation in subsequent washes 
and result in higher than expected bacterial counts and whether 
or not samples can be processed rapidly enough to avoid a 
decreased bacterial count due to the continued action of the test 
formulation should be considered when the decision concerning the 
use of a neutralizer in sampling solutions used for bacterial 
collection prior to the final wash is made. Whatever the 
decision, to facilitate the comparison of results across studies, 
the investigator is to indicate whether or not a neutralizer has 
been included.

antimicrobials (other than the test formulation) for the duration 
of the test. This restriction includes antimicrobial containing 
antiperspirants, deodorants, shampoos, lotions, soaps, and 
materials such as acids, bases, and solvents. Bathing in 
chlorinated pools and hot tubs is to be avoided. Volunteers are 
to be provided with a kit of nonantimicrobial personal care 
products for exclusive use during the test and rubber gloves to 
be worn when contact with antimicrobials cannot be avoided. 

(E) 

Selection of evaluable subjects. 

After panelists have 
refrained from using antimicrobials for at least 2 weeks, perform 
wash with baseline control soap. Subjects are not to have washed 
their hands 2 hours prior to the baseline count determination. 
After washing, determine the first estimate of the baseline 
population by sampling both hands and enumerating the bacteria in 
the sampling solution. This is day 1 of the ``baseline period.'' 
Repeat this baseline determination on days 3 and 7, days 3 and 5, 
or days 5 and 7 of the ``baseline period'' to obtain three 
estimates of the baseline population. Any subjects exhibiting 
counts greater than or equal to 1.5X105 after the first and 
second estimates of the baseline populations are obtained can be 
assigned to products in accordance with the randomization plan 
described below. Sufficient evaluable subjects must be enrolled per arm to satisfy the statistical conditions of
adequacy with at 
least 80 percent power and a test level of 5 percent. 

(F) 

Number of subjects. 

The number of subjects required 
per arm of the study can be estimated from the following 
equation: n"2S

2

(Z

a/2

+Z

b

)

2

/D

2

, 
where: 

S2 is your estimate of variance; 

Z

a/2

 corresponds to the level of the test; for a 5 percent 
test level = 1.96; 

Z

b

 corresponds to the power of the test; for 80 percent 
power = .842; and 

D is the clinical difference of significance to be ruled 
out; say 20 percent of the active control's mean reduction from 
baseline at a specific time. For example, data from a number of glove juice studies 
submitted over the past few years to the agency as part of 
applications under part 314 of this chapter were reviewed to 
obtain information relative to the variance of the difference 
from baseline for count reduction data. For 128 standard 
deviations extracted, it was noted that 50 percent of the values 
are between .90 and 1.12; 25 percent are less than .90; and 25 
percent are greater than 1.12. The range is from .49 to 1.73, 
the 25th percentile standard deviation is 0.86, the median 
standard deviation is 1.01, and the 75th percentile standard 
deviation is 1.20. The larger the standard deviation, the larger 
the sample size required to rule out a difference of clinical 
importance. Assuming that the active control surgical hand scrub 
produces a mean log reduction of 2.5 at hour 3 and the test hand 
scrub is to be within 20 percent of this, 

i.e

., D=0.5, and if S

2

= 
1.02, then n=64 subjects per arm of the study. Because blocks of 
six are recommended, the sample size per arm is 66. The S

2

=1.44 
corresponds to the 75th percentile in the data set. This gives a 
sample size of 90 subjects per arm. The total number of 
evaluable subjects required for a successful trial will depend 
upon the estimate of variance available and the number of 
products that need testing. 

(G) 

Study design. 

A randomized, blinded, parallel arm 
design is to be used to test the products. Due to the nature of 
their constituents, some test surgical hand scrubs will require 
not only the use of an active control arm but also use of a 
vehicle control arm and perhaps a placebo control arm to 
demonstrate efficacy. The schematic layout of sampling 

times is given in Table 1 as follows:

<TEXT>
 



The schematic layout of randomization of subjects in blocks of 6 is given in Table 2; in Table 2, R refers to right hand
and L refers to left hand as follows: 




Assume N evaluable subjects are enrolled (the issue of determining N, the sample size, is discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F)
of this section). First, randomly divide the N subjects into as many treatment groups as there are products to be tested
(n

t

). Secondly, randomize the n

t

 subjects within each treatment group in blocks of six subjects in accordance with the subject allocation scheme in
Table 2 of paragraph (b)(iii)(G) of this section until all n

t

 patients are randomized to 6 hours. Repeat this process for each of the other treatment groups. 

(H) 

Count determinations. 

No sooner than 12 hours, nor longer than 4 days after completion of their baseline determination, subjects perform
the initial scrub with the test formulations. Determine the bacterial population on the randomly designated hand
of all subjects assigned to hour 1/60 in Table 2 of paragraph (b)(iii)(G) of this section immediately (within 1 minute)
after scrub with the appropriate scrub formulation. Determine the bacterial counts on the designated hands at 3 and
6 hours after scrub. Determine bacterial population by sampling hands and enumerating the bacteria in the sampling
solution as specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(iii)(K) and (b)(1)(iii)(L) of this section. Repeat this scrubbing and
sampling procedure the next day (day 2). On day 5, repeat the sampling procedure after scrubbing with the formulations
two additional times on day 2 and three times per day on day 3 and day 4, with at least a 1-hour interval between scrubs.
Perform one scrub on day 5, prior to sampling. In summary, the subjects scrub a total of 11 times with each formulation,
once on days 1 and 5 and 3 times per day on days 2, 3, and 4. Collect bacterial samples following the single scrubs of days
1 and 5 and following the first scrub on day 2. This procedure mimics typical usage and permits determination of both
immediate and longer-term reductions.

(K) 

Sampling techniques. 

(

1

) At specified sampling times, aseptically add 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling solution to glove and hand to be sampled,
and fasten glove securely above wrist. 
(

) After adding sampling solution, uniformly massage all surfaces of hand for 1 minute, paying particular attention
to the area under the nails. 
(

3

) After massaging, aseptically sample the fluid of the glove. Transfer immediately a measured volume of the sample
to a serial dilution tube containing a suitable antimicrobial inactivator. 
(L) 

Enumeration of bacteria in sampling solution. 

Enumerate the bacteria in the sampling solution by a standard plate count procedure such as that described in ``Standard
Methods for the Evaluation of Dairy Products'' (available from American Public Health Association, Inc., 1015 15th
St. NW., Washington, DC 20005) but using soybean-casein digest agar and a suitable inactivator for the antimicrobial
where necessary. The suitability of the inactivator is to be demonstrated using a procedure such as described in E
1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and
Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916
Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520
Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700,
Washington, DC. Prepare sample dilutions in dilution fluid. Plate in duplicate. Incubate plated sample at 30 

#

 2 
 C for 48 hours before reading. 
(M) 

Determination of reduction obtained. 

(

1

) At each sampling interval, determine changes from baseline counts obtained with test material. 
(

2

) For a more realistic appraisal of the activity of products, all raw data should be converted to common (base 10) logarithms.
Reductions should be calculated from average of the logarithms. This will also facilitate statistical analysis
of data. 
(N) 

Comparison of test materials with a positive control material. 

(

1

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation
be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned
to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, except
that the scrub procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both
test and control formulations are to be run concurrently. Identity of the formulations used by panelists are to be
blinded from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data. 
(

2

) To validate the assay, compare changes from baseline counts obtained with control material at each sampling interval.

(O) 

Statistical analyses. 

Either of the statistical approaches to the evaluation of the data detailed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(O) of this section
is acceptable. 
(

1

) Treat data as a binomial response. That is, if a subject achieves the target reduction, it is judged a success; if not,
it is a failure. A potential problem to this approach is that information may be lost. For example, if at the 1 minute
time frame, a large number of subjects using one skin scrub achieve a 2-log reduction and those on the other scrub attain
only a 1-log reduction, the binomial procedure will indicate both scrubs achieve the same degree of reduction. If
it is believed that the binomial approach causes loss of information by not including numerical response data, then
the alternate statistical analysis described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(0)(

2

) of this section is applicable. If the success rate is in the 90 percent range, then the variance is relatively small,
sample size requirements are relatively small, and confidence intervals are reasonable. However, if the success
rates drop to the 70 percent range, then relatively large sample sizes are required to obtain the same power as one gets
for 90 percent success rates.

(

2

) Another option is to treat the log counts as numerical 
data and evaluate using the Student's t-test or similar 
procedure. The large variance that usually occurs with this type 
of data may cause problems with tests of significance and 
construction of confidence intervals. However, Monte Carlo 
techniques indicate that if entry is limited to subjects that 
exhibit 1.5x10

5

 to 10

6

 counts, then the reductions are rather 
homogeneous and the large variance problem is alleviated. 
If the variances are large, the sample size must be increased 
considerably to retain the same level of the test, same power, 
and same difference to be ruled out. 

(2) 

Effectiveness testing of an antiseptic handwash or 
health-care personnel handwash. 

An antiseptic handwash or 
health-care personnel handwash drug product in finished form

(ii) Demonstrates in vitro activity against organisms as 
described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 

(iii) When tested, in vivo, by the test method for the 
evaluation of antiseptic or health-care personnel handwash drug 
products described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, 
reduces the number of the indicator organism on each hand 2 log

Test Organism. 

(

1

) 

Serratia marcescens 

ATCC No. 
14756 (available from American Type Culture Collection, 12301 
Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852) is to be used as a marker 
organism. This is a strain having stable pigmentation. 

(

2

) The application of micro-organisms to the skin may 
involve a health risk. Prior to applying the 

Serratia marcescens 


strain to the skin, the antimicrobial sensitivity profile of the 
strain should be determined. If the strain is not sensitive to 
Gentamicin, do not use it. If an infection occurs, the 
antibiotic sensitivity profile should be made available to the 
attending clinician. 

(

3

) Following the last contamination and wash with the 
test formulation, the panelists' hands are to be sanitized by 
scrubbing with a 70 percent ethanol solution. The purpose of 
this alcohol scrub is to destroy any residual 

Serratia 
marcescens

. 

(

4

) 

Preparation of marker culture suspension. 

From stock 
culture inoculate 

Serratia marcescens 

ATCC No. 14756 in a 2-liter 
flask containing 1,000 milliliters of Soybean-casein digest 
broth. Incubate for 24 

#

 4 hours at 25 
 C. Stir or shake the 
suspension before each aliquot withdrawal. Assay the suspension 
for number of organisms by membrane filtration technique or 
surface inoculation at the beginning and end of the use period. 
Do not use a suspension for more than 8 hours. 

(D) 

Test panelists. 

Recruit a sufficient number of 
healthy adult male and female human volunteers who have no 
clinical evidence of dermatosis, open wounds, hangnail, or other 
skin disorders that may affect the integrity of the test, and 
enroll sufficient subjects per product being tested to satisfy 
the statistical criteria of the clinical trial design. 

(E) 

Preparation of volunteers. 

Instruct the volunteers to 
avoid contact with antimicrobials (other than the test 
formulation) for the duration of the test. This restriction 
includes antimicrobial containing antiperspirants, deodorants, 
shampoos, lotions, soaps, and materials such as acids, bases, and 
solvents. Bathing in chlorinated pools and hot tubs is to be 
avoided. Volunteers are to be provided with a kit of 
nonantimicrobial personal care products for exclusive use during 
the test and rubber gloves to be worn when contact with 
antimicrobials cannot be avoided. 

(F) 

Number of subjects required. 

The standard deviations 
for antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash 
obtained when an inoculant such as 

Serratia marcescens 

is used are more homogeneous than those for surgical hand scrub products 
discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F) of this section. The 
standard deviations extracted from data submitted to the agency 
as part of applications under part 314 of this chapter for these 
drug products range from 0.31 to 0.92; the median standard 
deviation is 0.71. The sample size estimation equation in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F) of this section may be used to estimate 
sample sizes required. For example, assume the active control 
hand scrub produces an immediate mean log reduction of 2.0 and 
the test hand scrub is to be within 20 percent of this, i.e., D=0.4. If S

2

=0.71, then n=50 subjects per arm of the study. 
Because blocks of 6 are recommended, the sample size per 
treatment arm is 54 subjects. 

(G) 

Study design. 

Randomization of subjects to time 
periods and treatment to hands will be accomplished in accordance 
with the plan presented previously. 

(H) 

Procedure. 

(

1

) 

Initial wash. 

After panelists have 
refrained from using antimicrobials for at least 7 days, perform 
a 30-second practice wash in the same manner as is described for 
the test and control formulations, except that a solution of 
nonantimicrobial bland soap is used. This procedure removes oil 
and dirt and familiarizes the panelists with the washing 
technique. 

(2) 

Contaminant suspension and hand contamination. 

The 
contaminant is a liquid suspension of 

Serratia marcescens 

containing at least 10

8

 organisms per milliliter. Five 
milliliters of the contaminant culture are dispensed onto the 
hands then rubbed over the surfaces of the hands, not reaching 
above the wrist. Application and spreading should involve about 
45 seconds. The hands are then held still away from the body and 
allowed to air dry for 2 minutes. 

(3) 

Contamination schedule. 

The panelists' hands are 
contaminated with the marker organism according to the following 
schedule: 

(

i

) Prior to the baseline bacterial sample collection. 

(

ii

) Prior to all 10 washes with the test material. 

(

4

) 

Baseline recovery. 

Baseline sample is taken after 
contamination of the hands to determine the number of marker 
organisms surviving on the hands after washing with a baseline 
control soap as described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(H)(

1

) of this 
section. Bacterial sampling will follow the procedures outlined 
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(H)(

6

) of this section.

) 

Wash and rinse procedure. 

The wash and rinse procedure described as follows is for all washes with the test formulation. A specified volume of
the test formulation is dispensed onto the hands and rubbed over all surfaces, taking caution not to lose or dilute
the substance. After the material is spread, a small amount of water is added from the tap and the hands are completely
lathered for a specified time period. The lower third of the forearm is also washed. After completion of the wash, hands
and forearms are rinsed under tap water at 40 



2 
 C for 30 seconds. A total of 10 washes with the test formulation is involved. Bacterial samples are taken following
the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes. 

(

6

) 

Bacterial sampling. 

After the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th washes, place rubber gloves or polyethylene bags used for sampling on the right and
left hand. Sampling should occur within 5 minutes after each of these washes. Add 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling
solution to each glove and secure gloves above the wrist. After adding sampling solution, uniformly massage all surfaces
of the hand for 1 minute, paying particular attention to the area under the nails. After massaging aseptically, sample
the fluid of the glove. Transfer immediately a measured volume of the sampling fluid to a test tube containing a suitable
antimicrobial inactivator. 

(

i

) Because contamination, product use, and enumeration are conducted sequentially within a time period of less than
a day, an inactivator included in the sampling solution prior to the final wash may affect the test results. Therefore,
no inactivator for the antimicrobial in the handwash formulation is to be included in the sampling solution prior
to the final wash. The 50 to 100 milliliters of sampling fluid may be sufficient to dilute out the activity of the antimicrobial;
however, this should be demonstrated using a procedure such as the one described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluation
Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents Used in Disinfectants, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual
Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR
part 51. Copies may be obtained from The American Society of Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA
19103-1187, or may be examined at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201,
Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 

(

ii

) If neutralization is not accomplished by dilution, include in the sampling solution used to collect the bacterial
samples from the hand following the final wash with the test formulation an antimicrobial inactivator specific for
the test formulation being evaluated. 

(I) 

Enumeration of bacteria in sampling solution. 

(

1

) Enumerate the 

Serratia marcescens 

in the sampling solution using standard microbiological techniques, such as membrane filter technique or surface
inoculation technique. Prepare sample dilutions in dilution fluid. Use Soybean-casein digest agar with suitable
inactivator as recovery medium. The suitability of the inactivator for the antimicrobial should be demonstrated
using a procedure such as described in E 1054, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Inactivators of Antimicrobial Agents
Used in Disinfectant, Sanitizer, and Antiseptic Products,'' in ``Annual Book of ASTM Standards,'' vol. 11.04, which
is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from The American
Society of Testing and Materials, 1916 Race St., Philadelphia, PA 19103-1187, or may be examined at the Center
for Drug Evaluation and Research, 7520 Standish Pl., suite 201, Rockville, MD, or at the Office of the 

Federal Register

, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Incubate prepared plates 48 hours at 25



2 
 C. Standard plate counting procedures are used to count only the red pigmented 

Serratia marcescens.

) [Reserved] 

(J) 

Determination of reduction. 

Determine at each sampling interval changes from baseline counts obtained with test material. 

(K) 

Comparison with a positive control material. 

(

1

) In order to validate the testing procedure, equipment, and facilities, it is required that the test formulation
be compared with an active control formulation. This will require an equivalent number of panelists to be assigned
to the control formulation on a random basis. All test parameters will be equivalent for both formulations, although
the handwash procedure for the established formulation may be different from that of the test formulation. Both test
and control formulations are to be run concurrently. The identity of the formulations used by panelists is to be blinded
from those individuals counting plates and analyzing data. 

(

2

) To validate the assay, compare, at each sampling interval, changes from baseline counts obtained with test material
to changes obtained with control material. 

(L) 

Statistical analysis. 

Because the hands are inoculated prior to sampling it is possible to generate counts of 1.5x105 to 106 organisms. Therefore,
reductions are less variable and evaluation of the log counts using the Student's t- test or similar procedure is recommended.

Effectiveness testing of a patient preoperative skin preparation. 

A patient preoperative skin preparation drug product in finished form suitable for topical applications will be
recognized as effective provided that the formulated drug product at its recommended use concentration: 

(i) Contains an ingredient in  333.412 (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e). 

(ii) Demonstrates in vitro activity against organisms as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. 

(iii) When tested, in vivo, by the standard testing procedure for the evaluation of patient preoperative skin preparation
drug products described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section and labeled according to  333.460(b)(1)
of this section, reduces the number of bacteria 2 log

10

 per square centimeter on an abdomen test site and 3 log

10

 per square centimeter on a groin test site within 10 minutes after product use and the bacterial cell count for each
test site does not subsequently exceed baseline 6 hours after product use. When labeled according to  333.460(b)(2)
and tested, in vivo, by the standard testing procedure described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, reduces
the number of bacteria 1 log

10

 per centimeter squared on a dry skin test site within 30 seconds of product use.

(C) 

Test and control skin sites. (1

) The skin sites selected for use in evaluating the effectiveness of the pre-operative skin preparation are to represent
body areas that are common surgical sites and are to include both dry and moist skin areas. The sites are to possess bacterial
populations large enough to allow demonstrations of bacterial reduction of up to 2 log

10

 per square centimeter on dry skin sites and up to 3 log

10

 per square centimeter on moist sites. A suitable dry skin area is the abdomen and a suitable moist area is the groin.
For the effectiveness testing of patient preoperative skin preparation antiseptic drug products labeled according
to  333.460(b)(2), a dry skin site such as the arm, from the shoulder to the elbow, or the posterior surface of
the hand below the wrist is to be selected. The sites to be tested are to have a bacterial population of 3 log

10

 organisms per square centimeter of skin. 

(

2

) Treatment and control sites are to be located contralateral to each other. Each site is to be 5 by 5 centimeters. 

(D) 

Test panelists. 

Recruit healthy adult male and female human volunteers who have no clinical evidence of dermatosis, open wounds,
or other skin disorders that may affect the integrity of the study, and in sufficient numbers per formulation being
tested to satisfy the statistical criteria of the clinical trial design.

(E) 

Preparation of volunteers.

 (

1

) Instruct the 
volunteers to avoid contact with antimicrobials (other than the 
test formulation) for the duration of the test. This restriction 
includes antimicrobial containing antiperspirants, deodorants, 
shampoos, lotions, soaps, and materials such as acids, bases, 
solvents. Bathing in chlorinated pools and hot tubs should be 
avoided. 
 
(

2

) Volunteers are to be provided with a kit of 
nonantimicrobial personal care products for exclusive use during 
the test. Volunteers are not to shower or tub bathe in the 24-hour period prior to the application of test material or

microbial sampling. Sponge baths may be taken but the skin sites 
to be used in the study are to be excluded. 
 
(

3

) If the skin sites to be used include areas that would 
require shaving prior to surgery, for example, the groin site, 
these sites should be shaved no later than 48 hours prior to the 
application of test formulation or microbial sampling. 
 
(

4

) After volunteers have refrained from using 
antimicrobials for at least 2 weeks, obtain an estimate of 
baseline bacterial population from one groin and one abdominal 
site at least 72 hours prior to entering subjects into the study. 
Sampling and enumeration techniques described in paragraphs 
(b)(3)(iii)(J) and (b)(3)(iii)(K) of this section are to be used. 
 
(

5

) Based on the initial estimate of baseline bacterial 
population, select sufficient numbers of subjects with high 
bacterial counts per formulation being tested to satisfy the 
statistical criteria of the clinical trial design. 
 
(F) 

Study design and randomization. 

Subjects admitted to 
the study are to be identified as to whether they meet the groin 
portion or abdomen portion of the study, or both. Once a subject 
is admitted to the study, treatments are to be randomly assigned 
to one contralateral groin site, for subjects identified as 
belonging to this study group and similar treatments are to be 
randomly assigned to left or right side of the abdominal area, 
for subjects identified as belonging to the abdominal study 
group. This method of choosing subjects and sampling sites fits 
the paired comparison statistical design. Randomization of 
subjects to time periods and treatment to left or right side is 
to be accomplished in accordance with the plan similar to that 
presented for surgical hand scrub products. 
 
(G) 

Number of subjects required and statistical analysis 
of data.

 (

1

) Two ways to statistically evaluate effectiveness 
of a preoperative scrub product are presented. The first depends 
upon calculating the average log

10

 reduction from baseline. This 
is accomplished by obtaining the difference in log counts for 
each paired sample for each subject in the appropriate sampling 
time frame. This will facilitate subsequent statistical 
evaluation of resulting data. It is usually fairly easy to enroll 
subjects with counts 1 x 10

5

 or greater when working with the groin 
areas. It is anticipated this method will primarily be used to evaluate data collected from the groin areas. The sample
size 
estimation equation given earlier may be used to estimate sample 
sizes required for this case. Standard deviations for 
preoperative scrub products are relatively homogeneous when 
inclusion criterion require counts of 1 x 10

5

 or greater. The 
standard deviations extracted from files range from 0.82 to 1.72; 
the median standard deviation was 0.98. When counts in the range 
of 1 x 10

5

 to 1 x 10

6

 were used, the standard deviation ranged from 
0.78 to 1.22, with a median value of 0.99. Using the sample size 
estimation equation given in paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(F) of this 
section and assuming the active control preoperative scrub 
produces an immediate mean log reduction of 2.0 and test scrub is 
to be within 20 percent of this, i.e., D=0.4, and S

2

=0.98, gives 
n=97 subjects per arm of the study. Because blocks of 6 are 
recommended, the sample size per treatment arm is 96 subjects. 
 
(

2

) The second method for evaluating the data depends upon 
establishing an entry target bacterial population of greater than 
250 colony forming units per square centimeter and a target 
reduction criterion that a successful scrub reduces bacterial 
counts to below 25 colony form
